The main subject of the research of the attached doctoral dissertation includes certain innovations of language of contemporary architecture that best correspond with examples of the development and influence of artistic practice on the emergence and development of kineticism and sculpturalism in modern architecture. Representative examples of kinetic modeling practices were selected and processed, then the examples of kinetic architecture, as well as the examples of kinetic sculpturalism, with detailed analysis of the interaction of artistic and architectural practices on their kinetic and dynamical properties of movements within the structure that expresses them. In addition to the historical parameters and the intersection of certain examples as well as different models of the determination of the presence of the artistic practices and of the improvement of the visual properties of objects, the method of inductive analysis or theoretical logical analysis was the primary method in the research and in the interpretation of aesthetic and visual characteristics of the development of kinetic and interactive architectural structures that are the subject of this study. The scientific contribution of the dissertation is in the formation of insights in the possibilities of the improvement of the application of artistic practices for development of innovations of language of contemporary architecture as well as the introduction of new concepts that exist and necessarily establish noticeable pre-existing characteristics of individual innovative phenomena of contemporary kinetic architecture. The primary research problem is the current state of lack of visibility of the role of established and potential relations of contemporary sculpture and architecture. It imposes through the subject of the research the further analysis of the relations of the sculptural practice and the architecture in order to provide a clearer definition of innovations that this relation establishes in the language of the contemporary architecture and the needs of its further development. The primary objectives of this study were: - Examination of the phenomenon of aesthetics and its developed layering through a historical review of the origin and development of kinetic art and its relations with architecture. - Consideration of possibilities of creative reading of previous experiences for the purpose of forming a future innovative concepts for improvement of the existing ill- defined models of aesthetic and 'responsive' thinking archisculpture structuralism. Identifying the occurrence of kinetic archisculpture. - Possibilities of further development of the archisculpture structures through more applicable interpretations of the problem of their application within the experiences of contemporary artistic practice. Pointing on the new tendencies of the development of kinetic archisculpture in innovative processes of the development of the language of contemporary kinetic architecture. To this end, the research was conducted in three phases: In the first phase of the research (Chapter I and Chapter II) are clarified the concepts and is defined the history of relations of kinetic sculptures and the kinetic architecture in the characteristic periods which are recognizable through their mutual engagement. On the basis of such consideration are attached the typical examples and are highlighted certain objectives as well as some of the expected results of this dissertation. In the second phase of the research (Chapter III) this work presents several mutually linked units which are marked for its further areas of the research. Besides the research of the archisculpture in the architecture of the 19th and 20th century, this work also includes the examination of the ideas of the philosophical concepts that deal with archisculpture as well as the examination of the role of the archisculpture in contemporary architectural and artistic conceptions of 20th and 21st century. In this phase of the research this work also includes the analysis of the historical and developmental parameters which define, initiate, establish and determine the specific properties of XX and its significance for detection of contemporary aesthetic properties of current and future structures kinetically defined XX. Within this phase of work and its analytical procedure we indicated on the innovations of the language of the contemporary architecture through specific models and practice which proceeded in the areas of the development of kinetic XX structures on which this research is referenced. The last third phase (Chapter IV) which is presented in this work refers to the reviews of the results of the previous parts of the research by considering new tendencies and possibilities for the development of the contemporary kinetic architecture, by comparison with the initial hypothesis and by indication on possibilities of opening further topics and fields of future researches and their possibilities in a given area. With those specified research entities this work points to the importance of the divisions, the identification and classification of the kinetic structures both in the field of artistic practice as well as in relation to the already recognized and clearly developed values of innovations of kinetic architecture (through support to the already existing, comparative and applicable solutions of contemporary modeling practices). The realized subject of this research is the identification, classification and recognition of the roles of the new tendencies that makes modern architecture when it successfully relies on sculptural practice and its experiences. The achieved scientific goal of this research is to develop a deeper understanding of values of the artistic practice and of the possibilities of her active participation in future developing segments of creation of new forms of kinetic and archisculpture structures. The establishment of the best possible aesthetic philosophical reflection values in applying of the innovation of the structures formed by artistic practices. The indication on the special importance in the emerging of free, creative and coordinative problem solving of the urban space through the better interpretation of the mentioned relations of the art practice in relation to the more complex phenomena of contemporary kinetic architecture with a focus on their mutual actions, meaning and the possibilities of anthropomorphic development. This research in relations of art and architecture has no aim to solve the problem, but its right movement and articulation, citing on increasingly frequent practice rendezvous and utopia through questioning of the reality with aspects of fine art values and sculptural practice, the latest interface in the arts of design and technological imperatives as existing startup condition of certain innovative phenomena of contemporary language of kinetic architecture. This work also indicates on the strategic values of innovations of the kineticism as the artistic practice as the possibility of development of anthropomorphic language of contemporary architecture through emphasizing artistic and formal aspects of the solution and application of conceptually defined new artistic media whose implementation can permanently and successfully establish a better quality experience as well as development opportunities of certain urban and architectural structures. By defining the existence of kinetic archisculpture this research by further analysis of their origin and significance, is developing a deeper understanding of relations of artistic practice and its effect on some innovative solutions of contemporary architecture. This opens a whole range of possible tasks that sublimate and suggest the development of this research both in the aesthetic domain but also in the field a coordinated creativity that already and necessarily makes the simulacrum of a new technological age of the future as well as society as a whole and the very architecture as his irreplaceable witness.
