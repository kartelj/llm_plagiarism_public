The research that this doctoral thesis will present evolves around the process of creating local models of architectural and technological interventions for adapting rural areas to climate change. Once defined, models will become a subject of different theoretical discussions. Term architectural and technological interventions will be analyzed and positioned in the contexts of local, rural, and climate change. Special part of this work researches rural architecture and ruralism in Republic of Serbia through the case study of West Pomoravlje region. Feasibility study of previously defined local models will be conducted on the same territory. The core of this work is a comparative analysis of multiple local factors relevant for definition of local context, as well as for categorization of architectural and technological interventions. The research will address the question whether it is possible to set a general method for creating local models of architectural and technological interventions positioned in the context of climate change or not.
