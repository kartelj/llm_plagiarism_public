Conditions and relations constituting architectonic comforts shall represent the subject of this research, by moving from material towards experiential, that is, from theoretical to practical elements of architectonic structure, so as to integrate redefined and restructured knowledge on comfort into architecture discipline. Reorganization of current knowledge on comforts, besides basic-physical comforts, encompasses a set of complex architectonic comforts, shaped through spatial and formal, existential and affective, social and communicational and cultural-signifying criterion. Qualitative architectonic comforts (formal, functional, sensuous, affective, domesticated, kinaesthetics, communicational, proxemics, mnemonic and comfort of creativity) along with quantitative physical comforts (thermal, acoustic, sound and visual) shape up the structure of elements of the overall comfort. The practical part of research, with regard early childhood environments, entails establishment of parameters, spatial indicators and architectonic vocabulary with the potential for evaluation of space through social interaction and cultural transmission and in relation to the intensity and character of observed and experiential relations between children and environment. Observation study of two nursery units shows that space is an important cognitive factor which quality depends on the level of complex architectonic comforts rather than quantitative physical factors. Universality of architectonic formation, as a methodological apparatus, is present in its applicability on the different structure levels as well as in different scales for both evaluation of existing spaces and designing of new spaces. Architectonic comfort could represent the key method with the potential to operate on behalf of comfort between material and cognitive, spiritual and instrumental, poetic and scientific, theoretic and practical in accordance with the architecture which is naturally placed in the middle of quantitative-qualitative dichotomy.
