Doctoral dissertation is dedicated to the development an of appropriate model for the purposes of prediction of ionospheric corrections with satisfactory accuracy for network RTK (Real Time Kinematic) applications. As a first step towards achieving this goal, short-term temporal ionospheric characteristics on regional spatial level were investigated in order to quantify its behaviour during different seasonal and daily periods. Data from permanent network stations on the territory of the Republic of Serbia were used. The analysis was conducted for four different season periods during the previous solar maximum during the years 2013 and 2014. After that the analysis of the change in the content of electrons in the D region caused by solar X-flares was performed, based upon which the temporal changes ТЕС (Total D Electron Content in D region) and their share in total TEC (Total Electron Content), i.e. the total delay of GPS (Global Positioning System) signals were investigated. Finally, an appropriate model for the purpose of the prediction of ionospheric corrections for network RTK applications on the territory of the Republic of Serbia is produced. Two predictive schemes based on the linear regression method and on the use of neuron networks were tested. It has been shown that the use of the neuron networks gives better results and is able to predict ionospheric delay on ±5 cm accuracy level in 9 minutes average in regards to the real rate of ionospheric changes. These results suggest that the modelling technique using neuron networks can be applied for predicting the ionospheric delay error in network RTK systems that will enable centimeter level positioning.
