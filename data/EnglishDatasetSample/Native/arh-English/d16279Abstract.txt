Dissertation presented is based on the theoretical interpretation of the academic oeuvre of architect Đorđe Petrović and focused on analysis of the discourse of integrity and autonomy of architectural drawing. Thematic framework of analysis was instigated by Petrović’s scientific and educational work at the Faculty of Architecture, University of Belgrade, within the field of architectural drawing (1959-1975), as well as his research in the field of futuristic and visionary architecture and Space art, which he conducted during his residence in Canada (1976-1989). Relevant period of the early seventies of the last century was taken as a start point of the analysis, when the concept of the New School was formed at the Faculty of Architecture in Belgrade, and Petrović introduced the concepts of visual research and visual communications in educational and theoretical framework, rethinking the role of architectural drawing as a purely technical instrument. According to the interpretation of Petrović’s interdisciplinary academic oeuvre, the basic problem is related to the definition of the characteristics of integrity of drawing in architecture through the established principles of aesthetics of structural forms, visual research of human environment, and the representation of space. At the same time, specified concept of integral nature of architectural drawing is evaluated in relation to the former socio-cultural context, as well as the actual practices of that time and the period preceding it. The aim of the thesis is reflected in establishing the modalities of implementation of integral architectural drawing in the field of scientific, creative and educational activities. ––
