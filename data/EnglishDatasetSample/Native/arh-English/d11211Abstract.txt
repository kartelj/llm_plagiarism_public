Annual energy performances of atrium type hotel buildings in Belgrade climate conditions are analysed in this paper. The objective of this paper is to examine the influence of the atrium on the hotel building energy demands for space heating and cooling, as well as to examine the contribution of applied measures for improvement of energy performance of one selected model. The energy performance results are obtained using EnergyPlus simulation engine, taking into account Belgrade climate data and thermal comfort parameters. The selected results are compared and the hotels are ranked according to certain single- and multi- criteria. The ranking of the proposed modes is conducted using PROMETHEE multi-criteria method followed by the final rankig using Borda model of group decision-making. The methodological approach in this research includes the creation of a hypothetical model of an atrium type hotel building, numerical simulation of energy performances of design alternatives of the hotel building with an atrium, comparative analysis of the obtained results and ranking of the proposed models from the buildingâ€™s energy performance perspective. The main task of the analysis is to examine the influence of the atrium, its shape, position, orientation and envelope structure on the energy performance of the hotel building. The goal of this research is to determine the most energy efficient model of the hotel building with atrium for Belgrade climate condition.
