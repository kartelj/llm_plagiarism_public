Тhe thesis of this research is based on the assumption that in the process of determining rhythm in architectural-urban compositions (first suggested and described by Carl Bovill), by using objects of fractal geometry observed as mathematical models of natural rhythm, a proper selection of fractal object, which will then appear as the mathematical model of rhythm in the process, is very important for the correct implementation of the process, and for achieving the desired result, i.e. rhythm with certain characteristics. The research should identify, analyze and scientifically describe and explain parameters that could be significant in the selection of the object of fractal geometry (one or more), so the determined rhythm would, after the process’s implementation, be similar to natural rhythm (in terms of characteristics that will be transferred from the model to rhythm), i.e. the manner in which variable value changes in nature, observed in the function of time, or position in space (one-dimensional, two- dimensional, three-dimensional). We will observe two types of fractal objects, both from the class of random fractals: fractional Brownian functions and random curds, both of which have been approved in scientific literature as acceptable mathematical models for various natural forms and processes. Parameters that affect the correct selection of the object of fractal geometry appear as characteristics of the very rhythm they are supposed to determine, and as characteristics of the observed fractal objects, where exactly the relation between stated characteristics is significant, with the initial assumption that for a specifically observed rhythm of elements of an architectural-urban composition there are fractal objects which, for reasons this paper will not attempt to examine, can be accepted as more or less favorable, or they cannot be accepted as potential mathematical models of rhythm at all. Simultaneously, since idea is that rhythm in architecture thus determined should be similar to natural rhythm, the selection of fractal object shall also be affected by relevant characteristics of natural objects themselves, described and measured with parameters of fractal geometry. In examining the relationship which establishes in the process between rhythm of the elements of architectural composition on the one hand, and the fractal object as the model of natural rhythm on the other, and which is here recognized as analogical relationship, this paper relies on results obtained by Dedre Gentner in her studies on analogy, more precisely, on her structure-mapping theory. Characteristics of rhythm in architectural-urban compositions which are assumed to affect the assessment of acceptability of the fractal object as the model of rhythm, and on the basis of which we will conduct the topology of possible cases of rhythm for the purpose of this paper, are: the number of spatial-temporal determinants necessary, or sufficient to specify the position, in a multiple occurence of entities, of each individual entity of the architectural-urban composition; also, are all chosen values of the visual feature acceptable and desirable in equal measure, and are all possible intervals between chosen values equally acceptable and desirable, in other words, is there a dependence between visual features and their possible intervals, and some relevant aspect of the architectural-urban composition, as well as the role the observed entity has in all that; what is the mutual relationship of similarities between chosen values of the visual feature of the observed compositional element; what is the number of chosen values of the visual feature. Сharacteristics of fractional Brownian functions, in relation to which we will examine their acceptability as models in the process, are: the value of topological dimension, and the value of fractal dimension (which is connected to other important mathematical properties: corelation of successive increments, inertness and spectral density), and characteristics of random curds, in relation to which we will examine their acceptability as models in the process are: Euclidean dimension of the auxiliary, or structural network bE, then, the number of iterations, or steps in the process of curdling, and the chosen probability for each step of the process. Furthermore, it will be demonstrated that, because of the presence of the component of randomness, rhythm generated in this way, and defined as non-exact, will be evaluated as natural, and at the same time, as a more complex and more irregular than rhythms defined here as exact. Also, we will show in what way the selection of fractal object as the model of rhythm with certain mathematical properties can affect the visual complexity of the generated rhythm, and thus, we assume, aestetic preferences for such rhythm.
