Problem of non profitability realization of planned regulations occurs at residential- business zones in Belgrade where approved urban plans are not in accordance with real- estate market demands. Economic valuation of urban plan implementation is an assessment of investment in real estate.

Profitability of cash flow is checked by static and dynamic methods. Results of checking confirm that urban parameters variation changes significantly the profitability of urban plan. The proposed model of profitability evaluation is defined on the basis of investment process. The model performance is examined on measuring subjects. The performed appraisals confirm that the model is applicable, as well at all levels, as for each particular case. Profitability evaluation model of urban parameters of residential-business zones in Belgrade is a system solution for checking planning decisions feasibility.
