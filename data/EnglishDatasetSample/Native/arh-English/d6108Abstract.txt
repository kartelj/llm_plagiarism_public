Problems of spatial concepts of an architectural work represent one of the crucial topics of
contemporary architectural theory and practice. The research of spatial concepts of representative
structures built for cultural purposes in the region of former Yugoslavia performed in this paper
represents the necessary starting point for studying contemporary architectural theory and practice
in Serbia at the beginning of 21st century besides its contribution to the studies of architectural
work in Serbia in 20th century. The research starts from the moment when cultural politics of the
new socialist Yugoslavia demands the creation of a specific architectural expression characteristic
of new Yugoslav social system thus marking a clear discontinuity with modern architecture of
period between wars. The first part of the paper deals with research of complex process of
theoretical definition of new Yugoslav architectural expression through a detailed analysis of
theoretical texts of experts who engage themselves in the thematic, designs for competitions for
representative objects of government administration and objects for cultural purposes in the context
of cultural politics in the researched period. Architectural expression of socialist Yugoslavia was,
in the complex and changing socio-political circumstances of after-war years, theoretically defined
at the beginning of the sixth decade of the last century and finally positioned as ‘the third way’
between the two dominant practices of the period and with a clear distinction, the West European
discourse of modernism model and the Soviet socialist realism model.
The second and third parts of research critically analyses the constructed cultural structures as
representatives of specific Yugoslav architectural expression which have, as proven by research,
completely realised contemporary spatial concepts of objects used as museums or of memorial
character. The specifics of concept in Yugoslav architectural expression stems from the basic
concept modernism with ideological annex of socialist society where development, transformation
and mutation of spatial concepts in cultural structures in Yugoslavia were realised in relation to
dual dependency, from fundamental paradigms of modern movement and socio-political changes
within Yugoslav cultural space.
