Increasing the representation of architectural structures of free forms, the use of curved glass, glass as a construction material, as well as the requirements for greater transparency of the building envelope, indicate to the need for a complex analysis of elements in the glass envelope of geometrically complex form, especially curved glass. The subject of this doctoral dissertation is research of potentials and limitations of (curved) glass application in the materialization of building envelope of geometrically complex form in order to realize a variety of design and economically acceptable solutions, both physically and technically adequate performance envelope, also taking into account the energy, and, to a certain extent constructive characteristics. The starting point of the research is the analysis of the role of architectural geometry in the design of the glass envelope as well as analysis of typologically different case studies with the establishment of a typology of glass envelope of geometrically complex forms and geometry of glass elements that were used and analyzed. In the research was applied the method of the survey in order to identify the elements and steps of the process of design and construction of geometrically complex glass envelope, after which it has been carried out creation of the process map and its verification by the major participants in the process, which represents the main contribution of this research. By detailed study of created hypothetical models, the geometry of form and materialization of each panel, as well as the entire glass envelope in which curved glass was applied, were investigated. The designs, the technological and economic characteristics of the hypothetical models are analysed based on pre-defined criteria in order to determine the potentials and limitations of the application of glass. The results are cross-compared and thoroughly interpreted and recommendations for materialization of the building envelope by application of curved glass are defined.
