This paper offers an analysis of architecture as a cultural phenomenon which communicates in several different ways. An attempt was made at elaborating the term architectural communication which is based on the theory of information, semiotic postulates, in particular with Umberto Eco (architectural denotation and connotation) and definitions of communication propounded by contemporary communicology. Architectural communication was analyzed through three types of relations which an edifice establishes with its environment: with the context (both social and physical), with users (utilization of architecture) and with the author/architect (architecture as a knowledge transmission). In the “building-social contextž relationship the connotative meanings prevail, while information related to the idea, construction and subsequent alterations to an architectural edifice is conveyed. The “building- physical contextž relationship is further analyzed in the light of intra and extra activity achieved by the architectural edifice with its physical environment. The analysis of “building-userž relationship is focused on dynamic denotation of segments of utilitarian space (denotative meanings). The analysis of architecture as a “field of knowledge productionž – “building-author/architectž relation – singles out those authors whose works made a special and innovative contribution in the field of architectural theory and practice. Thus defined forms of architectural communication were used for the analysis of cultural centers which were constructed in Montenegro in the second half of the Twentieth Century, in the era of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Twenty seven buildings in nineteen towns and townships across Montenegro were analyzed, namely: community cultural centers, cinemas, memorial centers, revolution memorial centers, art galleries, youth centers, theaters and Yugoslav National Army cultural centers.
