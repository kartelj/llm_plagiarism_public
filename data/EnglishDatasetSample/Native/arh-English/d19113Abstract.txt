This dissertation examines the relationship between vernacular architecture of
Serbia and its interpretation in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Former
researches of Serbian vernacular architecture, mostly, considered its formal
aspects, and its national character. Therefore, this dissertation’s focus is on the
analysis of vernacular architecture of Serbia in the context of vernacular
architecture in general, as well as its interpretation in the nineteenth and
twentieth centuries. The ultimate aim of the analysis of this relationship is the
overview of its framework and the understanding of vernacular architecture of
Serbia, and vernacular architecture in general, as well as of the effects that the
nineteenth and twentieth century interpretations had on vernacular architecture
of the period. The basic hypothesis of this paper considers the effect of the
observed period’s interpretation on the gradual disappearance of vernacular
building practices. On the other hand, this dissertation examines the potentials and
possibilities of the implementation of certain values and postulates of vernacular
creativity in contemporary architectural theory and practice.
