The main research goal is to reassess the notion of the good and to re-establish its constituent role in planning. The starting hypothesis is that the good is the basis for the existence of planning as an ethical activity, hence that, without believing that planning can contribute to better city development, the need for planning will disappear. Given the value of the good for planning, it is expected that, as such, holds a central position in the scientific debate about the essence and the role of planning in the contemporary context. From this conviction, the significance is given to the analysis of theoretical thought as a foundation for model formation through a systematic literature review. It is believed that the diversity of theoretical standpoints could influence the creation of Ð° normative basis for action in practice and enable the definition of aspects that guide value judgment about the good in city development practice. These elements form the logical setup of the model, which will be applied in the analysis of specific case studies in Belgrade to test the model and to define locally specific conditions. Accordingly, the main expected result of the research is the contribution to theoretical knowledge and the creation of a value-based judgment model, hence establishing a framework for legitimacy in decision-making on city development. The practical application of the created model is twofold. On one hand, the conceptual model should contribute to maintain the legitimacy of planning and question the basis for defining the regulatory framework, while on the other hand, it should contribute to the development of new evaluation methods of planning processes and products. Research should contribute to expert reasoning and greater awareness among planners and researchers about the importance of the good, thus contributing to a better overall position of planners in society and a broader social understanding.
