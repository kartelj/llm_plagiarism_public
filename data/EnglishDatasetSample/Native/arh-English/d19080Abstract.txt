The base assumption of this thesis is to make an active connection between universal
meanings of modern architecture of Belgrade and the historical context, reevaluating their
interaction with social identities through the lens of visual arts, for which film was deemed an
adequate choice. Initial presumption of the thesis is that modern architecture of Belgrade in
societal (film) context is not viewed as a mimesis, but rather a model utilized in production of
meanings that functions on the basis of signs organized in a visual language. As these
meanings are produced within culture and history, architecture itself is the product of societal
(politically motivated) knowledge, language structures, open text in societal and cultural fields
that, through power, utilizing productive network that pervades society, represents a certain
system of values and, as one in the system of political, cultural, scientific, art texts, exhibits
regimes of social identities form an archeology of knowledge. After World War II, the new
government in Yugoslavia promised a New world that ought to have been one of equality and
freedom – a New man’s world, that could be reached, after the conflict with USSR in 1948
and after foundation of ideological platform in authenticity of the Yugoslav revolution, by
socialist construction and transformation of society through authentic political, economic and
cultural program, dubbed the Yugoslav way. At the moment of this promise, the film industry
was institutionalized, that, despite liberalizations, until 1968, when the ideological platform
was changed, remained in the condition of state-controlled production. Representation of
Belgrade’s modern architecture in Yugoslav cinematography from 1945 until 1968 was a part
of representation system of self-governed socialist identity through architecture shown on film
(utilizing emancipated discourse of architecture inscribed within an non-emancipated
discourse of film), that was built displaying the system of modern architecture that could have
belonged to any of configurations, in line with its existing interpretative traditions, but are the
determinants of the representation of Yugoslav identity. Representation of modern architecture
was profiled through two paradigms that functioned simultaneously and depended on the
knowledge on self-governance and socialist democracy, societal-economical-political-cultural-
film context and the system of modern architecture (viewed as a social phenomenon) that was
depicted on film – paradigm of progress mythologization that fitted the concept of knowledge
of self-governed socialism as an authentic modernization creation, paradigm of the
construction of modernity, that represented the knowledge of self-governed socialism that
nurtures an authentic Zeitgeist. Interpretations from the standpoint of cultural studies indicated
that the configurations of modern architecture outside of its phenomenology are not
confronted with usual postulations of binary oppositions, on which the majority of
interpretative traditions are based, but rather that they serve to achieve fulfillment of cultural
roles and that they are open semiotic fields by which one community produces desirable
(moving) image of oneself.
