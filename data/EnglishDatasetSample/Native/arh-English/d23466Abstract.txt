Beginning with the idea that the elusive nature of the ambivalent position, between
belonging and not-belonging, is constantly placed outside existing conceptions, this
work aims to unlock the potential for a multiple layering of reality. Fragmentation is
positioned as a model for interpreting reality and for examining the capacity to measure
the ambiguity and incompleteness of architecture in a post-digital world and culture.
By destabilizing reality through the virtual, the visual world becomes a vision of
autonomous images – a visual experience within its own fragments. Thus, placing the
concepts of incompleteness and insufficiency on the same plane, as something that
eludes precise definition, we remain grasping for the possible. As a result, they remain
in an ambivalent relationship to their totality and the inability to fulfill it. This means
that the conceptualization of fragmented forms occurs virtually, depicting their own
outline through digital code, thus making variability and unpredictability a design
challenge; a task and a problem. The dual nature of all things raises the question of
exceeding one’s own reality, taking for one’s object the process itself and the
production of new conditions. Always being in-between, insufficiency paradoxically
becomes its own goal, one only possible if focus shifts to the process of creation or its
essential unattainability.
