The paper has analysed the behavior of individual unplastered and plastered straw bales, and unplastered and plastered straw bale walls. The use of straw bales in building load- bearing walls for one-storey structures has been analysed. Based on the experiment carried out within this study, the module of elasticity for unplastered straw bales was determined to be 400 kPa, and for the plastered straw bales 1580 kPa. For the straw bales the density of 1.18 kN/m3 was established. Creep-tests have been carried out, and the models of behavior defined, as well as the values of initial compression and creep. During the fire test, the wall plastered on one side only showed no visible damage after two-hour exposure, nor did structural features change. The available literature provided for noise and thermal protection levels. The economic analysis, which was part of the paper, underlined significant financial advantages of straw bale building. Based on the experimental and theoretical analysis, straw bales meet all necessary criteria and can be used in load-bearing buildings.
