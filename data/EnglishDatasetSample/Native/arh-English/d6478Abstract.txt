Socialist realism is usually interpreted as an imposed doctrine whose repressive features are
sought in form, mainly in relation to something else: in opposition to modernism, as a return to
styles of the 19th century, as proto-postmodernism in which the architectural elements "speak"
of the repressiveness of the regime, or the quest is given up on altogether for a monstrous
eclectic mix of obscure aesthetic principles to be affirmed. Art historiography of Yugoslavia is
additionally determined by the stigma of Yugoslav-Soviet conflict, and is typically
characterized by seeking the Yugoslav 'third way', that is, by emphasizing differences over
Soviet practice and finding deviations from the alleged socrealistic aesthetic pattern, which was
not properly defined in the Soviet context either, all based on the claim that it was abolished in
1948, although it was only then declared by the Party.
This dissertation is based on the position of Soviet theorists: that socialist realism was
not a style but a method of artistic production, that as such should not be analyzed in form. The
characteristics of a given method were not necessarily coming from the domain of art - several
decades of Joseph Stalinâ€™s building of power marked the procuring of all segments of society
under the aegis of the state, that is, the totalization of society by integrating political interests in
everything, from the economy to private life. The changes of political strategies were ultimately
able to find their reflection in each, and therefore in artistic practice, which, in turn, as a part of
that total mechanism, elaborated Party initiatives in a wide range of experts and thus
constructed the political system. The dialectical relationship of politics and art had not occurred
by decree - Socialist Realism (1934) and the Theory of reflection of Todor Pavlov (1936) were
the subsequent explication of the given system, which should be taken into account when
seeking differences in relation to the case of Yugoslavia.
The attempt to place the entire Yugoslav society on a new socialist basis could not have
been carried out by applying, but rather by planned and systematic enforcing of Soviet
economic and cultural model, according to specific historical, economic, political and cultural
conditions. The enforcing of socialist realism was also directly related to the interests of the
Communist Party of Yugoslavia, which firstly endorsed it and then, after the circumstances in
foreign policy have changed, abolished it. Therefore, this study tracks the development of the
coupling of politics and art that was introduced in Yugoslavia after the Soviet example: from
pre-war debates between left wing artists, through the preparation and implementation of the
Five Year Plan after the Second World War, to the renunciation of the Soviet model after the
relations with the West were restored in 1950. In that, instead of analyzing it in form or
proclaiming the repression of artists, and thus their innocence in front of the system, socialist
realism is considered a method of construction and distribution of power in the domain of art,
sought in the opening between Party directives and individual works: in the institutional
framework and organization of construction and design practices, program characteristics of
plans and projects, the process of building, as well as in architectural criticism and theoretical
principles of technical arts and sciences. These aspects, along with a comparative analysis of
events in internal and foreign affairs, are assumed to provide a better insight into the variety,
subtlety and the totality of political action in the field of architecture and a given social context,
as well as in the involvement of architectural practice in carrying out the political agenda of the
Party. The dissertation, in other words, raises the question of how under the auspices of
socialist realism the government built architecture, but also how architecture built the power.
