The thesis deals with the research of open spaces within healthcare facilities, namely the analysis of the impact these spaces have on the quality of stay in healthcare complexes, for all categories of users. The initial problem that triggered the research is the marginalized status of these spaces in science and in practice. The focus of this research is on the spatial characteristics of the quality of residence. Three proposed hypothesis claim that open spaces contribute to the quality of the stay in healthcare facility by positively affecting both physical and mental well-being of users, and that the quality of the stay in healthcare facility depends on open spaces within. For the purpose of the research, a multiple case study method was selected including three facilities of secondary and tertiary health care, on the territory of Belgrade. The research process itself is conducted with a combination of theoretical and empirical approaches. The combination of quantitative and qualitative research methods was used, while the focus was on survey and interview methodology. The results of this particular research confirmed all the aforementioned hypotheses, pointed out the importance of open spaces for healthcare users, and established relations between spatial characteristics of open space and quality of stay in healthcare facilities. The main contribution of this research is to expand knowledge in the field of health and open spaces, as well as urban design, landscape architecture and environmental psychology. The practical contribution of the paper is to develop a set of design recommendations for open healthcare spaces in order to improve the overall quality of stay in health care complexes.
