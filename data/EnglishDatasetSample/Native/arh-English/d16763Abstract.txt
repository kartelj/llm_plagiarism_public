This research will focus on application modalities of new media and technologies in contemporary architectural practice. It will consider and explore the influence of using new media on the development of new values, possibilities and phenomena of architectural space. The main hypotheses of the research point out that the application of new media modalities in architectural practice led to the development of new, dynamic and responsive technological models in architecture. The application of new media caused novelties and changes in both quality and function of architectural space, and it has established a new role for the passive user who is now becoming an active participant in creating and shaping architectural space. Common for computer technologies in the 21st century, trends of miniaturization and smart systems have led to the development of new materials characterized by radically new features and possibilities in terms of building architectural space. In new media architecture, notions of materials, technologies, media, devices and systems converge and overlap in designing dynamic and responsive architectural environments. In such circumstances and the age of domination of all kinds of computer systems this research is aimed to examine and thoroughly analyze application modalities of new media in architectural practice, in order to determine consequences and further possibilities of their use in architectural space. The scientific contribution of this research is consistent and systematic critical analysis and synthesis of existing knowledge in this developing scientific area, which is young and hasnâ€˜t been systematically explored, as well as establishing new scientific cognitions about possibilities and consequences of using new media in conceiving, designing and developing architectural space.
