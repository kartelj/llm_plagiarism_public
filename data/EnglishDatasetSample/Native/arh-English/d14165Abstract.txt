This doctoral thesis aims to present and explain research method and work on the
topic of specific positions of critical regionalism within architectural theory and
practice. A special emphasis of the research is focused on the ambiguous role of
metaphor in the practice within critical regionalism towards dogmatic and almost
ideological inviolability of the principles of modernism inside the specific
architectural discourse, but also to an actual author's position.
Hereby, the importance of the arhitect and professor Ranko Radović will be
marked as a problem-based framework of the research that should point out the
symbolic, aesthetic, anthropological, philosophical and historical model of
metaphorical interpretation, presentation and representation of givens. As the
main method of criticism and questioning of the canon of high modernism,
metaphor was placed in the service of relativization and contextualization of the
dominant paradigm back then. The consistency of the meaning and the potency of
the tradition have a special place in research, and have fully determined the nature
of Radović's design process.
