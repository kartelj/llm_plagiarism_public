The planning theory and practice have been characterized, for about the last fifteen years, by a search for the system of planning, that is capable of identification and sensitive to the citizens aspirations, in the process of protection and promotion of the mutual values. That kind of the approach to the planning is not new, and by some of its characteristics a certain relation can be made with the concepts of the representative or the lawyers planning, defined in the 1960s. However, nowadays, despite the widespread idea of necessity to include a broad spectrum of participants into the planning process, the concept is extremely well-formed and theoretically based, with extensive and highly developed check- up in the practice of planning, so it is said that it is a new communicative-collaborative paradigm. The terms that are related to the different varieties of planning with the emphasized participation of citizens are: жbottom –upж planning, жgrassroots’ж planning,ж participativeж planning and жcommunityж planning. The research explores the concept of the planning in which the participation of citizens, as one of the groups of the participants is considered not only a desirable but a necessary precondition of a good planning and the governance of the development. It searches for the answers to the questions: what is an efficient and effective participation, who are the ones who (should) participate and how should they do it, whether the information and communication technology (ICT) is a real support we can rely on, and whether or how is it really possible to achieve a modern concept of citizens participation/planning and thus potentially improve urban planning in the Republic of Serbia. The research is conducted at two levels:(1) The level of common conceptual orientations and their development up to the recommendations, based on the study of relevant theoretical work and global experience in this area, and then, on that basis and on (2) The level of urban planning in Serbia, as a research site at which the general level of conceptual orientations and their development are checked and adapted by the defining of the adequate model of planning for the investigated site. Based on the research of the different theoretical views, concepts and practice of planning, the possibilities were recognized and the methods and conditions for the realization of the modern concept of citizen participation in urban planning in Serbia were defined.
