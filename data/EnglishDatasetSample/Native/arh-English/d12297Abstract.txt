The main thesis of this paper is based on a review of the principles of authenticity and integrity at the outset of protection and presentation of medieval fortified towns in Serbia. Consistent approach would allow for a better preservation of the architectural heritage as a true document of the past (the authenticity of the design and form, substance and essence, management and function, tradition and technique) and the transfer of its meaning to future generations. Compromising the principle of preservation of the authenticity and integrity in the protection and presentation of architectural heritage leads to a loss of monumental value of cultural monuments, as well as to a lessening of the possibility of its survival or application for the World Heritage List. Therefore, it is necessary to improve the methodology of protection and presentation of medieval towns and fortresses in Serbia with Outstanding Universal Value. This requires better coordination of national legislation with international guidelines and practices, development of a successful strategy of each location in order to preserve it for future generations (application of modern principles and methods in the protection and presentation, which is reflected in the use of new materials, technologies and constructions, creation of the conditions for development of a specific cultural landscape, preservation of intangible heritage, etc.) but in regard for the authenticity and integrity of cultural monuments.
