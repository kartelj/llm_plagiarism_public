The main subject of this doctoral dissertation research is the area of the ancient city of Viminacium, the capital of the Roman province of Upper Moesia, founded in the 1st century AD, and an important legionary fortress, today an archaeological site and archaeological park not far from the town of Kostolac in Serbia. The work of a multidisciplinary team consisting of researchers from the Archaeological Institute and the Center for New Technologies Viminacium, from Belgrade, started at the beginning of this century, prevented the looting of the ancient city, enabled the continuous excavations of ancient buildings and the arrival of the first tourists, and established a legal boundary between the archaeological site and the progressive surface coal mine. However, the further development of the protection and presentation of the ancient Viminacium should include the introduction of a comprehensive concept of the protection and presentation of the space to which Viminacium belongs - the concept of a cultural landscape - while observing the contributions of all of the natural, historical, cultural and social factors. Thus, the concept created in this dissertation emphasises the specific landscape that is not only made up of the physical remains of buildings but also of immaterial values created as a result of the influence of different contexts through evolution, that is, the construction, deconstruction, and reconstruction of buildings, settlements and spaces. This approach is followed by modern heritage protection doctrines in which the notion of a cultural landscape is becoming more and more important. The research covers today's area of a protected archaeological site, but also an environment that is inseparable from it, in the economic, cultural, historical, social and sociological sense, as a result of their interrelationships, developed through the history of a human presence on it. Therefore, it was necessary to research, understand, and valorise the elements from all historical periods of the wider Viminacium area, which resulted in the proposal of a new concept, in which it was presented as a unique cultural landscape. Other archaeological sites, medieval fortresses, monasteries and old iii traditional houses, along with the industrial heritage created in the last nearly 150 years, and the Danube River, were analysed through their acceptance as equal factors of the area. It was demonstrated that the discontinuities of the physical elements of the past do not represent interruptions in traditions and the basic human relationship with nature, because the intangible values are links that mutually connect the physical remains from different historical periods in this unique space.
