The subject of this research defines the phenomenon of performativity in architecture through performance Studies, with an aim of explaining established relations, presenting where they originated from, as well as possible forms of their interpretation. Starting from the point that performativity in its general sense includes conceptual and operative reality, this paper researches ways in which architecture is released of following the formal path in the process of design, which identifies, discusses and explores the changeability and instability of boundaries in which architectural ideas and meanings communicate on a social and cultural platform. Contemporary position in assessing the current situation in architecture emerges by creating connection between performativity and architecture, established not only within visual and formal manifestations, but also in terms of common essential concept.
