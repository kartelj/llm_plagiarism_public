The topic for this dissertation has been chosen from the need of using broad urban planning experience and indentified problems of proffesional practice in theoretical reserch aiming in potential improvements in the City of Belgrade planning system. There are two equally important contexts in which the research has been conducted: a local one, aimed at positioning role of planning and increasing its effectiveness and efficiency under conditions of constant change, crisis, and uncertainty, and secondly, a global context, that explores urban phenomena, models of planning of European and Global cities, and achieving sustainbility while taking into account the complex urbanization processes and problems. The relevant research period represents a significant segment of the Belgrade transitional experience, spanning from 1995 to 2015; a period in which it is possible to follow relation between intensive socio-political, economic, and technological changes and related city planning policies. Planning has shown significat inertia since the end of eighties of the 20th Century, inspite the serious changies of the environmnet, investors’, governmental and public discontent and critisizm, and the necesity to ajust its function and dynamics. Traditional, comprehensive general planning methods and long lasting detail regulation processes have been critisized in general theory, and the need for the change of planning pardigm has been evident ever since. Meanwhile, Global professional debate has started on Sustainable Development Goals and New Urban Agenda, facing UN Habitat III Conference 2016, as well the role of planning and the future of planning profession in the new dynamic, mostly urban era. In that context the research includs an historic overview of urban plans and strategies and provides a broader look than the proposed research period, in an effort to analyse previous patterns in urban planning system, as a base for the anticipation of possible change in the planning system of Belgrade, bearing in mind global experience and local tradition. Belgrade’s dynamic environment can provide a case study of not only the transition of post - socialist cities in the region, but also for global cities facing perhaps different challenges within the same dynamics of the contemporary time. The research supports my hypothesis that important and intensive natural, social, political and economic urban change demand the inevitable Belgrade planning paradigm change, stepping out from one of conservative comprehensive, to strategic, process-based planning, and out of just public sector framework to different processes of ballansing needs and priorities of larger spectrum of urban stakeholders. The urban planning reserves significant role in the new planning framework, as one of the traditionally important and useful tools for urban management, although adjusted for a changed, dynamic environment, new demands, and development goals. Yet, it is necessary to involve other tools and instruments for the implementation of an urban strategy, aside from planning, and include stakeholders from various sectors in the realization of diverse strategic goals, given that they have not been the responsibility of urban planning to date. The experiences of the selected, successful city strategies demonstrate that contemporary planning, more than ever has become a tool for managing urban development, by which a good plan, as a process, and dedicated, consistent government authority, managing the urban change, were the guarantors of sustainable urban development in an unstable, constantly-changing global environment.
