Urban shrinkage has existed since the founding of a city; however, its frequency in last decades has caused the creation of the internationally accepted concept of shrinking cities. The phenomenon can be identified by population decline due to the limitations in the restructuring of an industry-based economy. Urban shrinkage is especially observable in space by empty buildings and semi-abandoned urban quarters. Great impact on the concept formation has had the rapid increase of shrinking cities throughout Eastern Europe, from the onset of post-socialist transition in early 1990s and with extreme examples in East German cities. Although the concept is important at regional level, it has not gained any recognition in scientific and professional circles in Serbia. On the other side, the majority of Serbian cities had population loss for the first time by the Census in 2011. This was particularly visible in middle-size cities with economy dependent on industry. This affirms the research of six relatively similar middle-size cities in Vojvodina. The topic of research is housing. There is no consensus at international level relating its role. The most of scientists considers it as the consequence of shrinkage, but numerous examples confirm that housing shrinkage more depends on local factors. Hence, this research has double aim; to identify the way of local and regional adaptations of the concept thought the demonstration that housing possess a complex role in urban shrinkage, which can influence urban redevelopment. In accordance with this aim, two-step analysis of selected cities was conducted by the criteria derived from international and regional postulates of the concept. The final purpose of the research is practical â€“ the creation of guidelines and recommendations for the adaption of planning in shrinking cities in Serbia, to overcome shrinking patterns.
