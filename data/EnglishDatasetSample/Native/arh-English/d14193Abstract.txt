The setting of design and architectural realisation today can not be considered separately from the emerging architecture, which is based on digital technology. Digital technology has primarily affected the architectural presentation, and eventually began to represent a design tool directly connected with the realisation, which was across various digital techniques establishing continuity of a „digital gap“ between the design and the architectural realisation. With the characteristics of continuous connection, this relation design - realization is increasingly manifested as a CAD / CAM technology and the most commonly researched as a „digital chain“ principle. Primarily, the term „digital chain“ is defined and investigated at the CAAD department at ETH Zurich (ger. ETH Zuerich) within the research projects of this institute where the candidate as part of its initial thematic research has already dealt with collecting research material, establishing Term glossary and Catalogue of referenced starting points (publications, institutes and architectural practice), as well as the basic explanation of „digital chain“ term in the design and architectural realisation. Today the tool has become an indispensable, inevitable and active, and the architect seemingly passive and in an unclear position in the whole process and the offered solution space and architecture. The development of digital technology within the architecture during last twenty years gives a clearer picture and the opportunity to explore the process of positioning the architect in the architectural approach based on the „digital chain“ principle, which this work covers. As a result, the positioning of an architect in the design and architectural realisation based on the „digital chain“ principle is an on going process that is developing, advancing, changing and follows the architectural development. The aim of the research is to establish an efficient, complex, specific and defined designing based on the characteristics of different materials, which continually leads to the limited series of an automated realisation of architecture in a creative and controlled contribution of the architectural profession in every part of the architectural chain. v The operational objective of this dissertation is to establish the position of an architect today and in the future, its positioning in the architectural process based on the „digital chain“ principle, as a metaphor of one digital approach in development, focusing on the innovative, demanding and thoughtful architectural design solutions to the process of overlapping activities with conventional principle (generally done, usual, presented mostly) in design and realization of the architecture, generally based on explanations of Bryan Lawson – psyholog, architect and researcher of design thinking. The establishment of the characteristics of architectural activities and regulated positions of a „digital chain“ by architects will contribute to accelerating the meaningful application of technology in architecture, and thus improving the design and production methodology based on trust and architects' confidence in technological innovation. „Digital chain“ principle has set new challenges, both in architectural theory and practice, as well as in methodology. The methodological approach to the work was carried out with a fundamental idea to establish a strategy in the global role of an architect in the emerging architecture through proving and implementing its characteristics as a necessity of the process, which, both with the constant changes and technological advancement in architecture, and in parallel examination of the behaviour of all the elements, subjects and the process structure through the project, has all the characteristics of the experiment. Accordingly, the methodological framework is, due to the topic being contemporary and interdisciplinary, predominantly phenomenological (hermeneutic, epistemological and interpretive) using qualitative and comparative methods, theoretically set to technology postulates in philosophy and architecture as a science, which candidate is also developing in parallel by structural and graphic connectivity with the causal methods. Qualitative findings suggest the researcher’s involvement with the problem and the subject of research, and in this case it is exactly the position of the author as a chronicler and a participant of a dualistic process of standard and digital access in the emerging architecture, as well as dualistic scientific and design approach to architecture in general, and the starting position of the research concept. Informational basis of the topic with theoretical premises, as the first part of the work is given in the first two chapters. Formulated by causal method of the sources and vi literature analysis, it represents determining and defining the context of emerging architecture in the form of conditions: introductory discourse of philosophy of technology related to architecture and cognitive theory; and the complexity of emerging architecture demands; modes: the chain as a principle of action and reaction in digital and standard approach in architecture, and then also defining conflicts in relation architecture – technology, that interpret the challenges of technology based on the problem and the solution, which carry certain restrictions of architectural operations; as well as the definition of digital design techniques, the realisation with the characteristics and behaviour of machines and materials using explicative method. The second part of the dissertation is conceived as a qualitative research - the study of „digital chains“ of different ways using CNC machines - fabrication with examples of realisation of serious architectural design requirements and meaningful architecture; the conclusions of the experiment – experience and self-knowledge of candidate’s cognition in the process of learning and adopting dualistic principles of design and realisation (primarily - the conventional principle of studying architecture, additionally – the „digital chain“ principle at the CAAD Master course, ETHZ); and interviews of subjects’ experiences - direct participants in dual principles emerging architectural practice, contemporary architects of the digital world architectural scene (orig. Matthias Kohler, Mark Burry, Mario Carpo, Robert Aish, Achim Menges, Fabio Gramazio, DUS architects) . In the third part, using the qualitative inference method in the form of architectural influences in design and architectural realisation based on the „digital chain“ principle - is carried out by comparison of direct overlapping „digital chain“ process with demystified standard architectural principle with the implication of the previously conducted research conclusions. The general approach to postioning of architects is trough defining of the necessary characteristics and activities of a human - architect: emotion, intuition, instinct; intention, decision choice; control, organization, coordination; creativity; flexibility; communication and expertise, systematically arranged at exactly specified positions - parts of the design and architectural realisation on the „digital chain“ principle. Evaluation of the results showed that continuity of the „digital chain“ is conditioned and bound by the implementation or existence of necessary architect’s vii characteristics in the design and architectural realisation based on the „digital chain“ principle and demonstrated the need for a redefinition of the architectural process by introducing new architect’s activities (coding, creation of design and realisation tools, digital expertise) with the aim of efficiency of the whole process required to do in terms of guided design - realization of architecture. Architects positions move the whole chain as fluid or the energy. Positioning the architect on the architectural scene of the emerging architecture requires also the willingness to experimental approach architectural realisation with continuous research of the process, machine and materials and in terms of observation and testing of the subjects, objects and structures of the process, with the inevitable changes in phenomena and elements in order to improve the parts of the process and the process itself. The scientific justification of this work is in the necessity and universality of theoretical research in the field of architectural design from the aspect of architecture and technology in terms of the development of the design process of solving complex problems in architecture, link between design and architectural realisation and expansion of the interdisciplinary nature of architecture as a scientific field of collective testimony and the profession of architects in general. Global conclusion is also a proven necessary re-definition of the standard educational architectural system with expansion of the digital design approach and architectural realisation domain as a necessity of the born digital generation for the purpose of education and improvement of future architects in the technological circumstances and the emerging architecture atmosphere.
