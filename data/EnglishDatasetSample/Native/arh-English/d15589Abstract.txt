This paper examines the possibilities of improving the energy performance of existing industrial buildings by application of the double skin façade on the rehabilitation of the building envelope in the climatic conditions of the Republic of Serbia. The aim is to examine the impact of the double skin façade when rehabilitation is being done on the energy needs of industrial buildings for heating and cooling, as well as the contribution of the measures implemented to improve the energy performance of the selected types and models of industrial buildings. The energy performance of buildings were obtained using the software DesignBuilder and EnergyPlus simulation platform, taking into account the parameters of thermal comfort and climate data for the Republic of Serbia. The comparative analysis of the results of energy simulation according to the criterion of achieving greater energy savings and reduced carbon dioxide emissions. The methodological approach in this research involves creating of a typology of industrial buildings in Serbia, selection of the specific objects according to whose properties by numerical simulation possibilities for energy rehabilitation depletion were investigated and comparative analysis of the obtained results was performed, ranking the types of objects in terms of the energy performance of the building. The primary objective of this research was to investigate the effect of the double skin façade on the energy performance of different types of industrial facilities and to determine the optimal approach to energy rehabilitation of existing industrial buildings with the implementation of the double skin façade under the climatic conditions of the Republic of Serbia.
