The strategy of the research paper is to conduct analysis of buildings for individual housing from the aspect of promotion of energetically efficient buildings construction. With that as a goal, all key aspects essential for design were analysed, such as: government regulative necessary to comply with when constructing and reconstructing a building, climate conditions of the given area necessary in planning the strategy of construction, the record of existing housing fund, cultural identity through heritage of traditional buildings. Through analysis of a traditional building, a representative model of the existing housing fund and hypothetical model- newly designed building, via software for analysis of energetic performances, the conclusions have been made and practical guidelines were given in the reconstruction of the existing and construction of new buildings based on tested scientific proofs. The work is focused on investigation and application of the elements of traditional architecture with a goal to improve energetic performances of new and existing buildings.
