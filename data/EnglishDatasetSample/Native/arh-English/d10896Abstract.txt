This dissertation investigates dynamics and directions of the change of urban and
architectural paradigm exemplified by the housing estates designed and/or built in
Belgrade between 1965 and 1991. The dissertation’s time frame envelops three major
historical processes shaping the theory and practice of socialist self-management in
Yugoslavia: the economic reform of 1965, the enactment of the 1974 SFRY
Constitution and the deconstruction of socialist socio-symbolic order during the late
1980s. The paradigm change is discussed in the context of the processes, that is, in the
light of the marginal position occupied within it by participation of end users. If self-
management was conceived theoretically as the ultimate form of participation and if the
foreign development of paradigms present in Belgrade urbanism and architecture of the
period involved concepts such as open form, participatory design and self-built, than the
goal of this dissertation is to establish the position paradigm change occupied within the
wider framework of socialist production of space, in the light of a lack of user
participation.
Supported by the thesis of the French neo-Marxist philosopher Henri Lefebvre,
regarding the production of space as a social practice, and by contemporary theories of
society’s lack of closure, the dissertation’s hypothesis is that self-management,
regardless of the marginality of participation, was indeed part of the urbanism and
architecture of Belgrade housing estates, or that late modern, postmodern, and
traditional paradigms of the period had constantly addressed self-management and the
antagonisms which had determined its theory and practice. Regarding the exclusion of
end users from urban and architectural design, the dissertation’s hypothesis is that this
procedure was shaped by the parallel strivings of several actors, including those in
whose name rare examples of open form, participatory design and self-built operated.
By investigating the institutional channels which had for decades regulated the
production of space of Belgrade housing estates, and by overlapping the results of this
investigation with the determined forms of action of planners and architects and end
users, the dissertation concludes that the change of urban and architectural paradigm
took place on several levels of alienation which made futile every attempt of consistent
following of the guidelines of official discourses of socialist self-management. Acting in
regards to encountered social divisions, urbanism and architecture of the period resulted
in difference towards the conditions and dynamics of the late modern and traditional
paradigms of the West, but not by emphasising participation in a stronger manner, but
by the absence and ignorance of it. Finally, the dissertation concludes that regardless of
harsh confrontation between parts of the discipline which cynically undermined and
rightly followed the emancipatory guidelines of the official discourses, these two
options played the same role of the harbinger of new social order of post-socialist
capitalism, which is also recognized as common to traditional urbanism and postmodern
architecture of the period.
