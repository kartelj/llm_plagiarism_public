This dissertation employs the symbolist theory as the methodological framework both for the interpretation and the perception of architecture. In the research the symbolic forms of creative expression are interpreted as elements of understanding the meaning of a work of architecture in a social and professional context. The meaning of expression in one of symbolic systems outside the work of architecture itself or outside architecture as such is investigated as the first form of symbolic expression of architecture. Designated as transcendence, this creative expression implies certain symbolic values of architecture, be it at the level of the symbolic form, symbolic spatial concept, motivation, or the idea of the work of architecture. The second form is discussed as immanent both to architecture as a discipline and the work of architecture as an immediately given objectivity. In that sense, architecture is observed as an immediately given phenomenon, in which the objectivity of physical representation and the subjectivity of its experience are intertwined. Implementing the general method of understanding, the dissertation employs generalization at the theoretical level, as well as the case study methodology in the concrete research issue interpretation (specialization), which is applied to the examples of architectural realizations of the architect Branislav MitroviÄ‡. In the analysis of the chosen examples, accompanied by appropriate comparisons, concrete works are interpreted in accordance with the theoretical framework of the research. In that way the concrete interpretation of a work of architecture is closely related to the creative work understanding based on symbolic functions. The resulting model of creative expression interpretation, firmly grounded in the theoretical basis, implies two ways of approaching a work of architecture: as having both transcendental and immanent qualities.
