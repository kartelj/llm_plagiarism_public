City represents its character through urban/place marketing by using their
tools, which is one of the most important activities of local government in its development
process. Communication, as one of the marketing tools, is achieved through the products
made in the variety of design processes, where urban design is also classified. Elements that
are relevant in the communication of the city can be physical factors of its environment,
including the pedestrian space.
The image of the city represents opinion or experience of the audience/users, based not on
the good intentions or marketing attractive commercial messages, but rather on the real
situation. This concept provides an opportunity for the analysis of the actual pedestrian
space networkâ€™s quality. In this way, the level of social responsibility of local government
can be determined, which influence the creation of certain audience/users attitudes, as well
as the image of the city. Furthermore, the importance of pedestrian spaces network in
creating, fostering and improving the competitive identity of the city represents the specific
field of application of the research results in the strategic decision-making and planning.
The validation of the determined relation was made on the examples of pedestrian space
networks of five European cities, which were singled out as the relevant representatives of
different categories set out by ESPON. Based on the results of these five case studies, the
models were created, as well as recommendations and guidelines for improving pedestrian
space network in the Belgrade center.
