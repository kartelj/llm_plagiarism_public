The overall objective of this research is to improve the theoretical discourse of sustainable development of the city through elaboration of a specific domain of sustainable urban land use from the urban morphology perspective, and to contribute to the debate on sustainable development of New Belgrade by systematization of a guidelines for sustainable urban land use from the perspective of urban morphology that can be of use as an input in planning the reconstruction of the existing structure and its possible thickening with the new construction. The research was conducted in three conceptually broad-based entities: 1 /theoretical and methodological basis, 2 /methodological approach elaboration with establishing the operational approach and 3 /operationalization on the example of housing superblocks of New Belgrade. Practical and theoretical discourses of urban land use were elaborated, holistic nature of the phenomenon and correlation between theoretical and practical spheres were proved. Phenomenon of sustainable urban land use were elaborated in detail, defined and explained the position it takes within European practice. The possible dilemma with the terminology were clarify: (American based notion “land use planningž widely encompasses use of urban land and virtually means “urban planningž, while the notion of „sustainable urban land usež is in direct connection to the idea of sustainable development and is rooted in Agenda 21 definition, what shifts focus to overall effects/consequences of occupation of this natural resource). By further detailed elaboration, activity fields were systematized and analytical frame for sustainable urban land use from the viewpoint of urban morphology was created: 1./ surface within the context of the typology; 2/uses/activities/functions within the context of accessibility; 3/changes that occur in distribution of uses through time; 4/some of elements of form which is built on the land through the aspect of sustainable building, and finally 5/interaction in urban space (those that have been caused by specific way of land occupancy/use) through public and private relation. After review and systematization of findings on common characteristics of methodologies that are used in contemporary urbo-morphology researches and researches from the sustainable development viewpoint, and by elaboration of the aspect of standardization within sustainable development, it was concluded that they encompass complex procedures, almost always implemented in several phases, includes many of data, and that there are no ideal sustainable development indicators and it was decided to rely on guidelines for wider coverage of sustainability problems in dissertation. Methodology for determining guidelines for the sustainable use of urban land from the perspective of urban morphology for the specific case of residential community, was created, and includes three stages: A/determining of general guidelines for the sustainable use of urban land from the perspective of urban morphology for the specific case of residential community of European cities (which are built within idea of sustainability /žEU guidelinesž); B/ determining of morphological typology of residential superblocks of New Belgrade (through typomorphology and morphogenetic approaches) and C/analysis of the present condition, evaluating the degree of compliance of the established types of residential superblock of New Belgrade with "EU guidelines" and determining "recommendations for the sustainable use of urban land from the perspective of urban morphology for residential superblock of New Belgrade." By applying the proposed methodology results are: - After the specifically defined method, analysis of the seven contemporary sustainable residential communities of European cities were conducted, by which the “EU guidelinesž were normatively defined (these guidelines can be used in the case of the application of this procedure to other residential communities, and / or innovate as needed) - By typomorphological analysis, database of typologies of residential superblocks in New Belgrade, were formed: four basic morphological type from the viewpoint of urban land use: Type 1, "on the ground", TIP 2 "partial denivelation" Type 3 "on concrete" and TYPE 4 "denivelation on concrete", with subtypes relative to the positioning of objects on the ground, "fortress" and "park" and compared to the car/pedestrian flows," segregation" and "integrationž, - The database for the morphogenetic analysis was created, and morphogenetic analysis carried out through an impact assessment criterion of previously dominant global trend in the design and impact of land policy, and is pointed to the prevailing conditions. In particular, in the aftermath of the twentieth century partial interest becoming dominant in the field of urban planning and land policy and thus substantially shaped housing (and related to the use of land) in New Belgrade, no longer the dominant trend in profession. - Analysis of the degree/percentage of adaptation of present structure of macro, meso and micro scale, each of the types of New Belgrade's superblock with "EU guidelines", with comments on the potential, provided the basis for the evaluation and establishment of specific recommendations for Novi Beograd: Results for macro level of urban structure of New Belgrade show intermediate level of compliance with "the EU guidelines" (65%) in terms of an upper limit to the quality assessment, which indicates that the activation of the potential can rapidly lead to improvement. This is an expected result given the fact that about 75% of the total residential superblock in New Belgrade are built before nineties of the twentieth century, and the evidence are: superblocks which were built during the seventies and eighties of the twentieth century, the concept of partial denivelation (Type 2), consistent with the best to guidelines (about 63%); with about 60% compliance there are superblocks that have been implemented since the beginning of construction in New Belgrade, during the '50s and '60s and sporadically during the '70s and '80s, (plane of the ground, usually rich with plants, TYPE 1); for both types there is a real potential for improvement towards sustainable development. Housing blocks built in the first decade of the twenty-first century on the territory of New Belgrade, with the underground garage, and flows on the level of surroundings (type 3) are at the lower limit, toward the poor condition of compliance with "the EU guidelines" (37%) and in relation to most criteria there is no potential for change, which also states for blocks built during the nineties of twentieth century, with denivelated pedestrian plateaus on the underground garage (TYPE 4), which are practically not in compliance with the recommendations for the sustainable use of urban land from the point of urban morphology - about 28%. - In the last phase of research the specific guidelines for the sustainable urban land use of importance for the morphological aspect for the New Belgrade was normatively defined, which is a contribution to the implementation of sustainable development goals into practice By realization of these goals working hypothesis are proven: Use of the established approach on the example of New Belgrade that gave the result as specific recommendations, proved its effectiveness and thus has proven that for a sustainable use of urban land can by operationalized approach within each specific case investigated, identified and systematized set of rules / recommendations from the perspective of urban morphology. Through a comparative analysis of the degree of flexibility of the structure of morphological types of New Belgrade’s superblocks for application of normatively defined "EU guidelines" for sustainable urban land use of importance for morphological aspect, and by synthesis with conclusions of the morphogenetic approach, has been proven that the morphological matrix of land use within the superblock of New Belgrade from the period when it was the dominant influence of world global professional trend (chronologically before nineties of twentieth century) have more potential for sustainable development - adaptable for implementation of the recommendations of sustainable urban land use from the perspective of urban morphology in relation to the morphological matrix of land use that have built influenced by land policy of the transition period (partial interest, since the nineties of the twentieth century to the present).
