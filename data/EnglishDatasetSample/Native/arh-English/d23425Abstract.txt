This paper examines the energy properties of parametrically modeled facades of office buildings in Belgrade climate conditions. The design of the facade was defined by the algorithm created in Dynamo, a visual programming software. Pieces of information from this algorithm are being used by Project Refinery, so it can analyzes solutions with variable size and distribution of the openings on the facade, for predefined fitness functions (direct sunlight illumination), using metaheuristic optimization method - genetic algorithm. Examining the results, the most efficient solution was chosen and improved with the implementation of the shades, wich variable length was defined by another optimization using a genetic algorithm, for the similar fitness functions. The results from all of the optimizations were used to create seven hypothetical models with real-life characteristics, in BIM software Revit. All models were tested in the cloud- based platform Green Building Studio for energy simulations, and the results were compared. The main task was to find the most optimal solution for the design of the facade for the office building in Belgrade climate conditions. The methodology contains an optimization of the facade using genetic algorithm, creation of the hypothetical models, numerical simulation of their energy performance, analysis of the results and ranking of the solutions by their energy properties.
