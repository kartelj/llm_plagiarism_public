This PhD thesis represents further contribution to the study and research of
aesthetics and theory of architecture. The framework of this PhD thesis is scientific
aesthetics of architecture established and conceived by Milutin Borisavljevic, Serbian
architect and esthetician, during second decade of 20th century.
Milutin Borisavljevic, who was an architect, theorist, critic, esthetician of
architecture and scientist which studied optical and physiological phenomena, left
behind rich legacy consisted of more than one hundred thirty buildings, close to one
hundred unrealized projects, drawings, sketches, twenty published books, over one
hundred seventy scientific papers and dozens of critics published in Serbian and
French newspapers, collections and magazines.
The main reason for creation of this PhD lies in the fact that fullness and
variety of Milutin Borisavljevic creative work to this date have remained unexplored
area. No comprehensive scientific study has been written about Milutin Borisavljevic
and his scientific aesthetics of architecture. His work in architectural design was
partially subject of analysis of some authors in the form of short study texts, however,
no one fully explored his theoretical concept of scientific aesthetics of architecture.
Although several researchers emphasized global significance and importance of
Milutin Borisavljevic`s work in the field of aesthetics, in the local environment, his
great contribution to the aesthetics of architecture has been forgotten and not fully
recognized.
Often we come across a statement that Borisavljevic`s aesthetics theory is
something valuable and very important which makes the whole world remembers his
name, but nowhere is to be found what the scientific aesthetics of architecture exactly
is. What kind of area is this or what kind of aesthetics? What problems fall in the area
of the aesthetics in question? On this key questions and many others this PhD thesis
strives to answer.
