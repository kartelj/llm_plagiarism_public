The research subject of the doctoral dissertation is within domain of folded plate structures designing. Because of the load distribution way, this type of construction has very strong interdependence between form and structure. Respectively system geometry has significant impact on structure efficiency. Since structure has simultaneously form and bearing function, this paper has a goal to perceive and apply both, architectural and structural (static – dynamic analysis) demands that structure must fulfill. The multidisciplinary problem approach has considered development of software algorithm for generating of structure, then primitive designing, following with integration of the group supermatrices procedure in finite element method, determination of macro finite element and computing of equivalent stiffness matrices of flat plate which is the main input for static- dynamic structure analysis. The advantage of parametric folded plate generator and defining of simple equivalent macro finite element suitable for GPS analysis is presented. Procedure implementation confirms innovation and improvement of architectural – engineering designing of the complex structural systems.
