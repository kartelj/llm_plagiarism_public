Starting point of this dissertation is in hypothesis that the presence of aesthetic consciousness in the architecture of analyzed objects means the existence of aesthetic consciousness of the authors and thus the existence of creative processes in the authors-creators of the architectural work. This is followed by the assumption that the existence of creative processes means an articulated use of certain (targeted) aesthetic elements indicating the presence of aesthetic consciousness. It follows from the above that, if present, a) the articulated use of targeted aesthetic elements, b) the creative process and c) aesthetic consciousness are always in an inseparable causal connection. Further, this dissertation analyzes and presents a recognized causal link: after an overview of observational aesthetic elements, it focuses on experiential aesthetic elements, the existence of which implicates the presence of the author’s aesthetic consciousness, as well as the existence of creative process within the author (creator of the object from the analytical architectural sample). More specifically, this dissertation explores and presents the use of experiential aesthetic elements: 1) aesthetic intent, 2) intuition, 3) imagination and 4) speculative thinking through the display, systematization and evaluation of all 31 public buildings of the “Bulevar oslobodjenjaž Boulevard in Novi Sad, Serbia. The analysis of the mentioned architectural/urban sample, along with an evaluation of employed (experiential) aesthetic aspects, demonstrate not only the presence of aesthetic consciousness, but also its level in the author and thus the quality level of the architecture from this period of time. By emphasizing the great responsibility of architects/artists and professionals as creators of society, this dissertation is expected to contribute to the theoretical and practical comprehensive study of aesthetics, aesthetic conciseness and creative processes in architecture (in the case at hand shown through the aesthetical analysis of the architecture of the “Bulevar oslobodjenjaž Boulevard in Novi Sad, Serbia), as well as to the scientific description and explanation of contemporary architecture of the second half of the twentieth century and the first decade of the twenty-first century in Serbia.
