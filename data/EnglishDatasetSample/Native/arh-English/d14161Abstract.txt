Application of vegetation walls is not a new concept in the realization of facade layer. The integration of vegetation in architectural objects can be a viable approach for the implementation of the facade of new and existing facilities. The vegetation walls are one of the more innovative and developed concepts of green building technology. This fact is based on the original scale buildings with vegetation walls that contribute in improving the overall design performance of buildings and become a significant factor in the process of improving the thermal characteristics of the buildings. This paper explored the potential of new technologies in the realization of vegetation walls in architectural buildings, their thermal characteristics and design potential of the building envelope in the climatic conditions of Belgrade. Research has shown that the application of the proposed design principles vegetation walls may be successful project solutions applied to the building envelope in the climatic conditions of Belgrade. The thesis provides an overview of technical innovations that can be applied in the design process to minimize thermal effects on objects. The study confirmed the possibility of improving the thermal facility by using vegetation wall as the building envelope.
