The thesis proposes unconventional procedure for design of surface structural systems, that integrates geometrical methods for modeling of form and computational procedures for simulation of structural behavior. The proposed procedure is in the form of morphogenetic strategy in which potentials of structural analysis are used in the conception phase of the design. The procedure is interactive and flexible, which is necessary for specific design process of surface structures. The definition of the algorithm, that facilitates more simple and efficient design of surface structural systems, was realized by implementation of Isogeometric analysis, numerical procedure in which geometry and kinematics of the structure are represented by the same functions. Contrary to the classical Finite element analysis, which is carried out on the interpolation of geometry, isogeometric concept implies analysis based on the exact definition of initial geometry, described by NURBS technology. This enables design, analysis and modifications of the model by application of the single data type. Starting from the theoretical and conceptual framework, the original algorithm was developed, and implemented as code program in CAD system based on NURBS geometric representation. The code enables automated generation of forms optimal in respect of structural performances. Implementation of the procedure demonstrates effectiveness of the proposed approach and confirms that advancement of the creative tools facilitates innovation and optimization of the design process.
