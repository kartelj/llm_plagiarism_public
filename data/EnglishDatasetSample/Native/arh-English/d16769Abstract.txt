The subject of this doctoral dissertation is the study of the appearance and contextualization of structuralism in Yugoslav architectural theory and practice in the period from 1954 to 1980. The aim of this research is to present and classify the theoretical determinants that defined the structuralist approach in architectural and urban planning practice and to point to the acceptance of structuralist ideas and methods on the architectural and broader intellectual scene of Yugoslavia in the given period. By means of a specific cultural concept that maintained the progressive ideas of the International and humanist Marxism, the politics of Yugoslav socialist society initiated the study of architectural and urban culture using the methods and basics of semiotics, historicism, dialectic, creativity, criticism, the revival of traditional cultureâ€™s humanistic values and establishment of a synthesis of the living space. The results of this doctoral dissertation indicate that, seen in a broader social context, acceptance of the structuralist perspective of cultural phenomena radically changed the then dominant functionalist approach in architecture. In this way, it may be confirmed that as an avant-garde movement, structuralism consequentially affected critical thought, and change in the functionalist principles and values, both in Yugoslav architecture and also within a broader culture of high modernism, establishing a new system of thought that aspired more towards aestheticization, a formal and semiotic approach and the establishment of universal and archetypal values derived from the study of vernacular architecture of national experience. Unlike its dominant position in the West, structuralism in the architecture of Yugoslavia manifested itself through the approaches of a handful of architects and theorists, in whose focus were the concepts of improving standards of living and humanizing the environment. Structuralist theory had an immediate effect on the change in architectural practice and urbanistic ideas in Yugoslavia during the 1960s and 1970s, first of all with regard to the development of residential architecture, and then also the architecture of hotel complexes, schools and residence halls, as well as cultural objects. Critique of the functionalist approach caused a shift in the direction of residential architecture in the 1960s and 1970s towards establishing harmony between the artificial world of urban structure and the natural environment, which may be seen directly in the application of new and more humane concepts in the residential settlements of the period. The results of research suggest that, although so-far unrecognized within the disciplines of architectural history and theory, numerous theoretical works of Yugoslav architects, their competition solutions and realized projects testify firsthand and confirm that structuralism had a strong impact both on the development of Yugoslav architecture and urban culture and the development of Yugoslav society in general.
