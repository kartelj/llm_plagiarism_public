Energy performance of a building is a result of various impact factors throughout its whole lifecycle: from laws and codes regulating its design and construction, build quality and materials application all the way to the occupant behaviour, maintenance and potential upgrades and adaptations. Establishing the current condition and real energy performance of buildings is necessary in the process of creating strategies for building fond management based on the postulates of sustainable development and energy efficiency of buildings. The subject of this dissertation is research of structure and energy performance of Serbian multifamily housing built after the World War II. The starting point of the research is the analysis of material characteristics of these buildings as well as relevant codes and regulations with establishing appropriate periodization. Typical fa√ßade assemblies are determined for each period, to be explored in detail by studying the technical documentation, calculating and simulating energy performance and on-site explorations using the infrared thermography method. The specifics of infrared thermography method are thoroughly researched and described both through theoretical and practical aspects. All relevant input factors are identified and explained, the possibilities for application in architecture are determined and explored, including the constraints and the most common mistakes and misinterpretations. The adequate procedures are determined and a set of recommendations is defined in order to provide proper application of the method. Energy performance of buildings is explored by calculating relevant parameters based upon current regulations, by computer simulations and by infrared thermography. The results are cross-compared and thoroughly interpreted, and a catalogue of typical cases is provided.
