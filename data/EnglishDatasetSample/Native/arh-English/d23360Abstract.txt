By a unique perception of the existance of the hither and the transcendent reality, the architectural reality is a unique reality of the fictional world, since it is real as well as unreal, while the world of its imaginary realities of the one and the same reality can be imagined both consciously and unconsciously. These imaginary realities represent his fictional and oneiric reality in the transcendent reality and a unique, existing and new architectural reality in the hither one, only when a Designer, in the process of designing by dreaming, instrumentalizes the oneiric fiction of architecture in a project of a reality beyond reality. By dreaming in the transcendent realities, fictional and oneiric ones, and then by a transition into a New Reality, He is a Designer of a unique consciousness, being a unique subject of the fiction who designs by a unity of imagination, oneiric and creative imagination of the dreamy fiction world of a dream of the fictional and oneiric entity of the architectural design. When the oneiric fiction of architecture in the project of reality beyond reality is instrumentalized by its new fiction in the project of reality within reality, a dreamy fiction world of the dream is his architectural dream of the project of reality of the one and the same, but a New Reality.
