This research explores interdependence and interaction between the sustainable architecture, health tourism and salutogenic spaces with the aim of defining a synthetic, integrated design model that would include significant principles for all the three fields (domains). The application of this model in reconstruction of the existing health tourism buildings (especially for those built in the second half of the 20th century, such as the Institute for Physical Medicine, Rehabilitation and Rheumatology “Dr Simo Milosevicž in Igalo) would significantly improve these facilities. Key aspects for all the three domains are health (preserving health and well-being) and sustainability (an integrated model of sustainable development whereby environmental aspect prevails economic and socio-cultural aspects). In the domain of sustainable architecture, the impact on health has been analysed through the aspects of environmental preservation (natural influential factors of the environment), as well as through the aspects of providing comfort (thermal, air quality, visual, acoustic, psychological aspects of comfort, connection to nature) by applying passive design measures. In the domain of health tourism, health preserving/enhancement is the basic reason for traveling, thus being of vital importance for health/touristic destination, while the crucial aim of creating of salutogenic (healing) places is the health improvement of facility users. Sustainability has been analysed through bioclimatic design measures and principles of humane design within the domain of sustainable architecture; through the sustainable development of health tourism (preservation of the natural healing factors and the environment; low-carbon tourism and tourists’ satisfaction), and as a significant principle of creating salutogenic places (the contemporary design triad: sustainability- resource awareness, function- commodity and perception- delight). Furthermore, within the domain of salutogenic (healing) places, important analysis topics are evidence based design and contextuality. The analysis of all the three domains resulted in the synthetic model of valorization of health tourism centers, adopting the salutogenic environment as their referential framework (natural, built, symbolic and social environment), and having sustainable architecture and health tourism as its subcomponents. This model entails aims, criteria, indicators and recommended measures of valorization of health tourism centers, providing a base for the case study: valorization of the existing spatial, ecological, functional and health touristic capacities of the Institute in Igalo, aimed at determining improvement possibilities related to future reconstruction of the Institute by applying those measures that are currently underused. The aim of the research is to establish a new theoretical and practical design methodology for health tourism centers that would integrate crucial contemporary design principles of sustainable architecture (humane design), health tourism and creation of salutogenic (healing) environment, which would enable sustainable development of the health tourism destinations and contribute to the creation of healthier, more agreeable, more humane, more inspiring, human scale places and ambiences and significantly improve health and well-being of users.
