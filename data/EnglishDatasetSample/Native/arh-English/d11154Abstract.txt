When the word „expressionismž is mentioned in science, it usually refers to style movement which appeared in architecture and the arts at the beginning of the XX century and lasted until 1930. However, there is a wider interpretation of the term, which defines expressionism not only as a style movement but as one of the key creative tendencies, i.e. the essential factor in all arts throughout history. By relying on the wider interpretation, this paper discussed potential presence of expressionism in architectural culture in Serbia during the XX century, even though the prevailing opinion claimed that expressionism did not have a more significant influence on the architecture in Serbia. By critically analyzing theoretical positions in literature, we examined the similarities and differences between basic aesthetic categories: „expressionž and „expressivenessž. We also confirmed their relation to the phenomenon of expressionism, with an aim of providing a clearer interpretation of it, as well as establishing its presence in Serbian architecture. By studying most prominent expressionist achievements in world architecture, we extracted expressionistic principles and characteristics whose presence we examined on leading architectural examples in Serbia. By comparative analysis of selected architectural objects, made in XX century in Serbia and marked in reference books as expressionist, our paper concludes that expressionism represents the key principle and one of the essential creative tendencies in XX century architecture in Serbia. Moreover, expressionism in Serbia did not emerge at the same time as in other parts of Europe (1905-1930), the turning point leading to its appearance was the beginning of the sixties in the XX century, when the first projects and realizations appeared, implementing complete expressionist articulation, which opposed the existing viewpoints in science.
