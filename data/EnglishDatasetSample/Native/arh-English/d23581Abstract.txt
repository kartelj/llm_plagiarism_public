Itâ€™s been concluded that all of the research related with the energy efficiency is mostly done for residential buildings. Even besides the efforts of the state and public to improve situation in that sense there have not been some significant progresses. In Serbia, there are no researches to give detailed analyses of energy performances of sport buildings. Part of this paper is analysing of energy efficiency of significant group of sports buildings, universal sport halls within the sports centres that are the most represented in Belgrade and Serbia. Basic research question is which extent in improvement we should take to improve these facilities. Research should give basic directions for improvement measures of thermal insulation materials and use of passive features. Subject of the research of this doctoral thesis is checking of possibility, strategies and techniques to achieve energy optimization in the processes of refurbishment of universal sport halls in sport iv centres as well theoretical and analytical audit of quality of each implemented measure according to the existing rules and defined comfort conditions. Results of this research can find direct implementation in refurbishment of sports facilities in the aim of achieving energy saving by minimizing interventions. Results can have practical use because of implementation of the measures that present realistic situation. Computer simulations were used to present behaviour of reference models. Beside the implementation of individual and package of measures, by specific methodology, analyses of use of integrated systems of sustainable energy were investigated. Software package IES VE Integrated Environmental Solutions Virtual Environment is used for analysis of implementation of mentioned passive and active features.
