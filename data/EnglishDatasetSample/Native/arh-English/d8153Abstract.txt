This dissertation indicates the need to establish a dialogue between comprehensive morphological investigations and practice in planning and design where the possibilities for linking the process of theoretical elaboration and practical implementation are interpreted through a research concept and phenomenon of city block which represents a typical morphological entity, on the one hand, and an urban level at which effects and interdependence of planning and design process manifest themselves, on the other hand. Through a morphogenetic analysis of an city block, it is possible to identify a character and causes of natural processes or directed planning processes in urban development, and vice versa: based on an analysis of the existing state and contemporary processes of urban development, it is possible to presume appropriate shape of physical structure and interpret it at the level of block. In this context, the block can represent a research concept in architectural and urban planning processes both in the stage of the analysis of the existing state and in the final stage of setting the guidelines in the form of recommendations for planning and building rules or for defining a model. The creation of conceptual models of city block implies a visualization of outcomes of morphological and contextual investigations and a guideline towards extrapolation of theoretical research into planning and design practice and vice versa: practice is a basis and material of accumulated knowledge, skills, innovations of architects, planners, involvement of all actors, which is incorporated into the theory through research and evaluation and represents a starting point for the development of new concepts and modalities in operationalization.
