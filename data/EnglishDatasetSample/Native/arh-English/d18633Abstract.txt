The subject of the proposed research are architecture exhibitions that were organized within the framework of socialist Yugoslavia in the period after the Second World War. Having in mind the growing number of researches that are related to architectural exhibitions, as a special form of manifestations on a global scale from one, and researches relating to the history of socialist Yugoslavia, with a special emphasis on architecture and urbanism, on the other side, exhibitions in question are considered as collective activities whose research allows insight into the broader context of social, economic, political and cultural events within the post-war Yugoslavia, and the status that architecture has had within them. The focus of the research is on the potential of the exhibition to be part, and at the same time to shape the discourse of architecture primarily as a place of debate between the architectural profession and the public, or as a place of promotion or criticism of ideas within the domain of architecture. Architectural exhibitions will be seen as a cause, but also as a consequence of certain changes and developments in a wider social, cultural, political and economic context. Defined in this way, the framework of the proposed research allows additional research and analysis of topics of exhibition practice in the domain of architecture, as well as the modalities of post-war architecture in Yugoslavia. During the discussion of exhibition practices, the exhibitions are not analyzed as isolated events of the presentation of architectural works in certain periods of socialist Yugoslavia, but as a framework for production, reception and evaluation of architecture, through analysis of the entire process of organization of exhibitions, selection criteria, thematic framework and place of exibiting. By researching the exhibitions of architecture created within socialist Yugoslavia at all stages of its existence, as a larger interdependent system, phenomena and changes within the theory and practice of architecture can be monitored, which can show us the status of architecture in the Yugoslav society and what it was like her role within the Yugoslav cultural space.
