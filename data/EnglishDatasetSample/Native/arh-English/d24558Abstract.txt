The main thesis of the paper refers to the critical understanding of architectural detail as an integral part of the design process, in which there is a reconciliation between different levels of thinking, design intentions, and technological procedures. These are crucial for conceiving and formulating architectural design's poetic and technical aspects to achieve its tectonic potential. With the development of new digital design tools in recent years, tectonics of architecture is becoming an area of particular relevance in the architectural discipline. This research seeks to understand the complexity of the relationship between the design process and a critical approach to new technical and technological tools, organization, and construction models. By analyzing the theory of tectonics and its relations to contemporary architectural practice, the research observes the architectural detail through methodological procedures and principles in the service of coherent conception and actual materialization of the architectural project on its practical and intuitive level. The central perspective of the research assumes the ambiguity in the notion of architectural detail and design process that offers the possibility for its understanding outside the existing classification in theory and practice. The detail is regarded as the particular position where the construction and marking of an architectural project at the micro and macro level occurs. The focus is on establishing a connection between the meaning of architectural detail and the development of disciplinary and interdisciplinary knowledge and concepts in the context of modern tectonic practice through the formation of a methodological-interpretive model. Starting from the poetic and technical aspects of the architectural detail, the paper explores the conceptual foundations of architectural creation and the broader socio-cultural context of the origin, translation, and realization of these concepts.
