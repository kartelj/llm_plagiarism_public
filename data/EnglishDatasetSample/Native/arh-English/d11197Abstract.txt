This doctoral thesis explores the contemporary appearance of phenomenon of
architectural model, accessed through phenomenological analysis. The intention is
twofold: to highlight the role and importance of models for the design of
contemporary architecture, and at the same time to clarify the need for recognition
of phenomenology in the field of contemporary architectural education.
To carry out these intentions, the work focuses on (1) the issue of
contemporariness, (2) the open relationship of phenomenology and architecture
and (3) the structural analysis of the object of architectural model. Theoretical
plane is underpinned by experimental project-models, used as architectureâ€™s
investigative tool for the study of autonomy identity, origin of form and meaning of
purpose, delivered through student exercises at Belgrade Faculty of Architecture.
This thesis also presents reflections on how to use models in architecture.
