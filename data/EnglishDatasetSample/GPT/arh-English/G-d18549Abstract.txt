This research contributes to the exploration of planning activities and the transformation of Belgrade's urban waterfront landscape. It begins with an examination of the initial ideas and concepts for the development of Belgrade's waterfront areas. The study reveals a gradual emergence of diverse urban structures over time, influenced by the unique natural conditions of an indented acquatorium at the confluence of the Sava and Danube rivers. The city's heritage and geographical location, built and developed on the Belgrade ridge, have shaped the area's unique urban landscape and its intriguing history. Political circumstances, socio-economic changes, and numerous wars have added dynamism to the transformation of the urban landscape. 

The research traces the settlement's relationship with water, starting from the earliest known planning activities, such as Emilijana JosimoviÄ‡'s 1867 Plan for the Town within the Moat. The initial ideas for developing a new city section on the other side of the Sava river were grounded in the international competition held in 1922 to prepare the Master Plan. Post-World War II political changes led to rapid construction and development on the left bank of the Sava river, resulting in significant transformations from natural to urban landscapes. 

Modern architecture was introduced to the Belgrade waterfront through new urban planning theories. Changes in socio-political and economic conditions in the 1980s led to different ownership structures, impacting spatial planning and architecture. The study pays particular attention to the Sava Amphitheatre as a resource of the Belgrade waterfront. Despite the advent of 21st-century neo-liberal economies, there has been no significant shift in spatial planning concepts. The research raises the question of how to address the issue of the Belgrade waterfront, considering the inherited diverse concepts of the two river banks.
