While the question 'what is a concept' remains relevant, this study delves deeper into the specific query: 'what is an architectural concept?' This text is built upon philosophical theories, ideas, and fragmented philosophical bodies. These foundations are given an architectural interpretation and application, which could potentially disrupt the current theses and findings before giving them an architectural form. Therefore, the text can be read backwards, starting with its tentative conclusions and working back towards a fuller understanding of its premises. This dual reading approach uncovers an object that is never considered in the present but instead, by projecting into the future, transcends its own time. The exploration of the architectural concept, the main focus of this dissertation, offers a philosophical-aesthetic platform for the epistemology and methodology of architectural design. The goal is to demonstrate and clarify the need and uniqueness of integrating contemporary architectural theory and practice, with the hope that this research's outcomes will serve as a primer for the development of a new architectural platform – architectural philosophy. Similarly, the new design methods serve as the prerequisite for the creation of the new. The research is situated within the self-designed analogy space between architecture and philosophy, with the most noticeable intersection being the production of concepts. Looking ahead, any production relies on the design of concepts and their objectification, implying that we can discuss production with, by, and through concepts. This inevitably leads to the conclusion that architecture is always about creating something new. The central hypothesis of this dissertation is that within the overall architectural creation, appearance, and execution, the concept is the first projected architectural object, creating ideas to manifest its own authenticity in another object – the phenomenal form of architecture. The initial premise is that the architectural concept is intuitively projected as both a real and illusory object. The second premise is that the highest value achieved with the architectural concept is the perfect dream that harmonizes the real and the illusory. The third premise is that the architectural concept, once materialized into a tangible object, returns to its creator seeking a new life as a philosophical-aesthetic object. In this endless temporal flow, the architectural concept is what generates the new and critically opens the question of what comes next. A specific layer of the text, integrated into its overall structure and content, includes the terminological structure interspersed with the intention to define architectural terminology and explain significant philosophical concepts that shape both the philosophy and aesthetics of the architectural concept. In this regard, the work can be read as a new architectural linguistic concept.
