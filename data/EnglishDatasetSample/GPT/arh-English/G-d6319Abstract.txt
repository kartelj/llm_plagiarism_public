The recent history and theory of architecture has seen contemporary classical architecture emerge as a significant area of study. Its increasing prominence in modern architecture necessitates an examination of its origins and presentation methods, a critical review of its key proponents' concepts, a comprehensive exploration of the challenges in showcasing the history of ideas that support classical architecture, and the development of a broad range of concepts related to this modern phenomenon. This research focuses on the theoretical stances of contemporary classical architects used to explain their work and attempts to establish a continuum of ideas between these architects and Renaissance architecture theorists. 

The study also provides an understanding of how theoretical thought on contemporary classical architecture is manifested in modern architectural theory and how it is classified as a significant theoretical form of architecture in the 21st century based on the authors' theoretical views. The theoretical underpinnings of contemporary classicism in architecture are distinctly different from those of other contemporary theorists. 

These architects align with Renaissance theorists in their unique approach to architectural history and their views on collectivism, historicism, zeitgeist, and formalism. They reject collectivism and historicism, arguing that a work of art is not defined by the unpredictable and changing context of the artist. They uphold the idea that the laws of each art form are refined over time, first by formalizing observed facts on historical buildings, then by evaluating and examining these facts, and finally, by transforming them into abstract types and general rules for modern use. 

They support formalism in architecture, which negates the zeitgeist. They believe that the aesthetic qualities of architecture stem from the spatial model of the building, suggesting that form, rather than meaning, contributes to architectural evaluation. They argue that in the design process, the architectural form is established first, followed by its articulation into ideas. 

The study is divided into two parts: the first part groups the general theoretical principles of architectural history and theory into subheadings based on specific methodological criteria, which are then cross-referenced with the theoretical arguments presented in the second part. Seven key themes are identified from the specific theoretical views on contemporary classical architecture, and seven new thematic and theoretical positions are established, providing a foundation for understanding the theory of contemporary classicism in architecture and its relationship with the Renaissance. 

This diachronic exposition of theoretical positions in architecture, which includes its complex and multi-faceted relationship with the broader cultural field of social sciences, offers a new interpretation of contemporary phenomena in architectural history and theory.
