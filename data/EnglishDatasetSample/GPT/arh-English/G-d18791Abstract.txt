The doctoral thesis explores the integration model of historical city centres and river coastal areas in post-industrial cities, a topic within the realm of urban planning. The historical centre, a crucial element of urban space, adapts and evolves with growth, ultimately enhancing urbanization and living conditions. The study identifies the principles of forming the historical centre and the river coastal urban area. A morphological perspective on the directed growth of the existing historical centre is established, aiming to incorporate the planned river coastal urban area into the urban unit. To comprehend the research problem, specific locations in selected cities (Belgrade - Republic of Serbia, Zagreb and Osijek - Republic of Croatia) are examined, along with reconstruction ideas. As cities grow in complexity, the amount of unplanned, spontaneous, and partially directed development of the historical centre increases. The research's primary objective was to link parts of the river coastal area with the historical centre, creating a new integrated quality form of utilization and surface use. After validating the hypothesis, the three city examples confirmed that the historical centre and the river coastal area are vital city and river components, and their integrity highlights the city's value. The integration of the historical centre and the river coastal area can be achieved by planning the historical centre's directed growth, considering the city's context and identity. Spatial integration planning is feasible within the "gravitational field" between developmental poles. At this point, the varying intensity of mutual attraction between the historical centre and the river coastal area (Osijek - intensive, Belgrade - medium intensive, Zagreb - low intensive) is determined. Based on the thesis, future urban planning will present scenarios for measuring the integration of the historical centre and the river coastal area. A realistic scenario for Belgrade involves directing the historical centre's growth with variations (Danube and Sava) of river coastal arrangements and integrating them into a spatially physical frame. In Zagreb, the pessimistic scenario of integrating the historical centre and the river coastal area should be altered by bridging the conceptual gap between the "central axis" plans and the river coastal management's implementation to lessen their separation. The optimistic scenario for Osijek depends on the complexity and uniqueness of their interrelationship and expression, with the potential for the historical centre to transpose into the new urban area on the river's left bank. The fact that a city has developed under specific influences and interactions is a constant factor in urban planning. The historical centre and river coastal area's artefacts and history cannot be reconsidered. The dissertation includes a portion on the urbanism history of Belgrade, Zagreb, and Osijek during their time as part of a shared state.
