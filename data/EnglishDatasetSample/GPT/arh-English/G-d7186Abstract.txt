The demand for information is escalating across all strata, from national and international decision-makers to individuals. A significant modern challenge is the creation of information support for sustainable development. The focus is on developing ICT tools using GIS technologies for efficient data collection, storage, updating, handling, analysis, and display related to territory, crucial for understanding territory in collective decision-making and creating sustainable policies and plans. In sustainable development, everyone is both a user and an information resource. An integrated approach to sustainability necessitates the development and widespread use of modern planning and management methods, tools, techniques, and procedures for the best possible interpretation and integrated analysis of territory in group decision-making on specific actions and assessment of their impacts, risks, and benefits for environmental, social, and economic development. This research is driven by the need to facilitate Serbia's effective participation in the current global development process. Current local and regional activities aimed at enhancing the information base for decision-making and monitoring of integrated territorial development are centered on developing and applying the concept of territorial information systems based on ICT and GIS technologies for more efficient administration, improved vertical and horizontal coordination, cooperation, and rationalization processes in information and communication activities, with a focus on improving the quality of the information base for decision-making. Studying international experiences in developing and implementing such models aids in understanding their potential and limitations in Serbia. This research focuses on developing a territorial information system model to support sustainable urban development in Serbia, serving as a new communication and decision support tool in collaborative planning and local development management. The research aims to structure a TIS model that would be applicable in the current changing planning paradigms and practices, and in the future when a new planning model based on active participation of all development actors is expected. The application of the TIS model in Serbia should contribute to changes and improvements in urban planning and spatial development, and redefine the role of planners to help them answer operational questions related to sustainable urban development. The study's outcome should be a scientifically-based operational TIS model to support sustainable urban development in Serbia, structurally defined at all levels - substantive, functional, and institutional - organizational, and its implementation methodology at the local level confirmed through pilot projects. The research's scientific contribution is to establish a new foundation for further theoretical and conceptual redefinition of the planning system in Serbia, questioning the role of planners and planning agencies, and ultimately laying the groundwork for the development of new planning methods and techniques in Serbia as a new qualitatively improved information base.
