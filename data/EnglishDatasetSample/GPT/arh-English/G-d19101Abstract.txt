The thesis explores the utilization of open urban public spaces and the factors influencing decisions on movement and navigation within these spaces. It examines the patterns of public space usage, specifically pedestrian corridors, within the context of space syntax theory which defines space configurationally, meaning it views space in terms of relationships rather than distances. This perspective on space is closely tied to the cognitive perception of the user and the creation of cognitive maps. Space configuration, with high precision, can either foster or eliminate "life" in a public space by defining potential meeting areas. These relationships are systematic and are a result of architectural and urban design. However, in addition to these global configuration parameters, there are also local parameters related to the perception of space at specific points when deciding on the direction of further movement. Until now, these parameters have been observed in two dimensions, but this thesis aims to determine the impact of three-dimensional space on these decisions, using specific navigation tasks. The initial assumption of the research is that analyzing pedestrian movement through urban environments from a geometric and cognitive perspective can identify physical potentials for activating open public spaces. The use of parametric modeling tools in space syntax techniques allows for the definition of specific interventions in urban public spaces. The research will be conducted using a combination of basic and specific scientific methods and techniques from architecture, urbanism, and social studies, including scientific analysis, case studies, surveys, and statistical methods. The first part of the research establishes the relevance of using parametric space analysis, providing a tool that enhances existing techniques and allows for the introduction of new parameters in further analysis. The second part of the research, conducted via a survey, reveals that the navigation movement of users in a familiar space is influenced by various parameters, with the most dominant being the individual's subjective sense of the shortest route, closely linked to the smallest angle deviation from the diagonal direction from the starting point to the destination. This suggests that the formation of users' cognitive maps is not based on a pre-defined route, but on individual decisions to change direction at certain characteristic route points. This is especially evident when there is no dense structure of surrounding facilities at these points, or when the space does not guide the user to a clear continuation of their movement. This research aims to enhance the role of the pedestrian movement network in activating public spaces in urban environments. Understanding the user's perception of space, which is primarily configurative and global, is crucial during urban planning. Attention must be paid to space elements and their position in the overall movement system. At the local level, the layout of space and environmental elements play a significant role as potential meeting locations in the total concentration of population movement. Therefore, this thesis contributes to the scientific and professional reevaluation of parameters in urban design.
