The primary aim of this study is to enhance the theoretical discussion on sustainable urban development by focusing on sustainable urban land use from an urban morphology perspective. The research also aims to contribute to the sustainable development debate in New Belgrade by providing guidelines for sustainable urban land use that can be used in the reconstruction and potential expansion of the existing structure. 

The research was divided into three broad categories: theoretical and methodological basis, methodological approach elaboration, and operationalization using New Belgrade's housing superblocks as an example. The study elaborated on the practical and theoretical aspects of urban land use, proving the holistic nature of the phenomenon and the correlation between theory and practice. 

The study also clarified the terminology used, explaining that the American term "land use planning" encompasses urban land use and is essentially synonymous with "urban planning". The term "sustainable urban land use" is directly linked to the concept of sustainable development and is based on the Agenda 21 definition, which focuses on the overall effects of occupying this natural resource. 

The research further elaborated on the topic, systematizing activity fields and creating an analytical framework for sustainable urban land use from an urban morphology perspective. This framework included surface within the context of typology, uses/activities/functions within the context of accessibility, changes in use distribution over time, elements of form built on the land from a sustainable building perspective, and interaction in urban space through public and private relations. 

After reviewing and systematizing findings on common characteristics of methodologies used in contemporary urban morphology and sustainable development research, and by elaborating on the aspect of standardization within sustainable development, it was concluded that these methodologies involve complex procedures, require a lot of data, and that there are no ideal sustainable development indicators. Therefore, the study decided to rely on guidelines for a broader coverage of sustainability issues. 

A methodology for determining guidelines for sustainable urban land use from an urban morphology perspective was created for the specific case of a residential community. This methodology includes three stages: determining general guidelines for European cities, determining the morphological typology of New Belgrade's residential superblocks, and analyzing the current condition and evaluating the degree of compliance of New Belgrade's residential superblocks with the "EU guidelines". 

The results of applying this methodology showed that the urban structure of New Belgrade has an intermediate level of compliance with the "EU guidelines" (65%), indicating that there is potential for rapid improvement. The study also found that the morphological matrix of land use within New Belgrade's superblocks from the period when global professional trends were dominant (before the 1990s) have more potential for sustainable development compared to the morphological matrix of land use influenced by the land policy of the transition period (since the 1990s). 

In conclusion, the study proved its working hypothesis that a sustainable use of urban land can be operationalized within each specific case investigated, and that a set of rules/recommendations from the perspective of urban morphology can be identified and systematized. The study also proved that the morphological matrix of land use within New Belgrade's superblocks has more potential for sustainable development.
