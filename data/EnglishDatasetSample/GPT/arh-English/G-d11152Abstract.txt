This doctoral thesis explores urban space phenomena through a cinematic lens, aiming to test and verify the cinematic aspect of architecture. It contributes significantly to contemporary architectural theory, attempting to uncover the functional role of the cinematic aspect of architecture within the theoretical and methodological framework of modern architectural design. The research extends beyond traditional architectural views, positioning architecture as an art form - the art of shaping space. This perspective allows architecture to instigate a review of perceptual principles and the experience of architectural space, and to establish a relationship between the concept of movement and the design elements and principles of both film and architecture. 

The thesis proposes a view of the potential outcomes of such manipulations after the cinematic apparatus has influenced the transformation of spatial conceptions into a cinematic event. It focuses on the changes in the perception of space and the visual and imaginative discoveries of filmmakers and architects. The research also investigates the impact of ongoing changes in contemporary architectural discourse on the spatial context of the cinematic aspect of architecture. 

The research has shown promising results in the potential to enhance and upgrade established urban practices, specifically Cullen's urban strategy. A theoretical extension to Cullen's urban study was made possible through the definition of elements and operable principles mobilized through the theoretical concept of serial vision. 

The dissertation also explores the relationship between architecture and film, demonstrating points of connection and relating them to the current state of contemporary architectural discourse. The research continues by investigating potential innovation in the theoretical and methodological framework of architectural design after verifying the cinematic aspect of architecture. 

The thesis concludes by discussing the potential for an innovative approach to contemporary architectural design strategy, conditioned by the interpretation of these phenomena through a concept of architecture. It also highlights the unique perspective this research offers, which has not yet been discussed in national or international scientific publications. The research differs from previous and current studies in its comprehensive analysis of the possibilities of applying filmmaking strategies and techniques to architecture.
