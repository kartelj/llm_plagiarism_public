The study focuses on the interplay between urban environments and university and scientific complex spaces, examining the historical, social, and technological aspects of urban development. It underscores the significance of critical research in exploring the ties between cities and knowledge-driven innovations. As such, the importance of innovation and knowledge as key drivers of urban success is highlighted. The research scrutinizes the prevailing trends in the knowledge economy, using Belgrade as a case study of local practice. The study's contribution lies in its elucidation of how universities, university campuses, and scientific complexes (R&D zones) foster the development of new urban structures, forging strong ties with cities at both local and international levels. The research topics contribute to the integration of urban spaces and R&D zones, as well as other pertinent factors in the latest initiatives spearheaded by universities and scientific research institutions in the context of modern city transformations. Various socio-economic and political processes shape the evolution of modern cities by striking a beneficial balance between financial aspirations, environmental consciousness, and sustainability. The study underscores the importance of central, public spatial content â€“ the agora space. The latest initiatives from universities and research institutions stimulate the emergence of new spatial formations and digital enhancements, thereby creating a conducive environment for intellectual exchange and the production and dissemination of knowledge and innovations.
