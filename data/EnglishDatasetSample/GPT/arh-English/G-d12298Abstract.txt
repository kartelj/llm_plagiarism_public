This PhD thesis explores the creation, development, and execution of Belgrade's 1923-24 General Urban Plan. It scrutinizes the influence of design suggestions from the 1921-1922 international competition on the General Plan's structure and concept. It also compares the Plan's original intentions with its actual outcomes, identifying obstacles that prevented its full implementation. The study considers Belgrade's urban planning and growth between the two World Wars, in the context of the social and economic conditions of the newly established Kingdom of Yugoslavia.

The thesis highlights this significant era in the city's evolution, identifying and explaining key stages in the development and execution of the General Plan, which was drafted in 1923 and adopted in 1924. It utilizes published and extensive unpublished materials, gathered from local and international archives and related institutions, many of which have not been previously analyzed or interpreted.

Designs from the international competition to expand and regulate Belgrade formed a crucial basis for the General Plan, resolving some of its main challenges. The competition was unique as most participants were foreign, resulting in the General Plan being heavily influenced by contemporary urban planning theories and practices used in European cities.

The General Plan, despite its flaws, was a comprehensive document, offering a modern vision for urban planning and city structure development for the first time in Belgrade's history. This was revealed through an examination of the Plan's program and associated reports, studies, and designs for various sectors and issues.

The thesis also analyzes the role of different stakeholders in the Plan's implementation, from state institutions and the economic elite to the city's residents. It reveals that many disregarded the Plan's provisions, with the ruling elite and state institutions being the main culprits.

A comparative analysis of the planned versus actual outcomes up to and after the Second World War reveals a significant deviation from the original Plan. This had a profound impact on the city's regulation and overall morphology. However, aspects that were implemented in line with the General Plan have resulted in well-formed and commendable urban areas.

This study illuminates important uncertainties and assumptions about Belgrade's urban planning during the interwar period. By utilizing overlooked and lesser-known sources, this PhD thesis enhances our understanding of Belgrade's urban planning and architectural evolution in the first half of the 20th century, opening up opportunities for further research in this area.
