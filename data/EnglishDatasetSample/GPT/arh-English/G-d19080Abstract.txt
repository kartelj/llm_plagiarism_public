This thesis primarily aims to establish a dynamic link between the universal interpretations of Belgrade's modern architecture and its historical context, reassessing their interplay with social identities through the perspective of visual arts, with film being an appropriate medium. The initial hypothesis suggests that in a societal (film) context, Belgrade's modern architecture is not seen as imitation, but as a model used in the creation of meanings based on a visual language of signs. 

These meanings, produced within the framework of culture and history, position architecture as a product of societal (politically driven) knowledge, language structures, and an open text in societal and cultural fields. This, through power and a productive network that permeates society, represents a specific value system and, as part of the system of political, cultural, scientific, and art texts, displays regimes of social identities forming a knowledge archaeology. 

Post World War II, the new Yugoslav government pledged a new world of equality and freedom â€“ a world for the New Man, achievable through socialist construction and societal transformation via an authentic political, economic, and cultural program, known as the Yugoslav way. This promise coincided with the institutionalization of the film industry, which, despite liberalizations, remained state-controlled until 1968 when the ideological platform shifted. 

The portrayal of Belgrade's modern architecture in Yugoslav cinema from 1945 to 1968 was part of the representation system of self-governed socialist identity through architecture depicted in film. This was constructed by showcasing a system of modern architecture that could belong to any configurations, in accordance with its existing interpretative traditions, but are the determinants of the representation of Yugoslav identity. 

The representation of modern architecture was shaped through two paradigms that functioned simultaneously and depended on the understanding of self-governance and socialist democracy, societal-economic-political-cultural-film context, and the system of modern architecture (viewed as a social phenomenon) depicted in film. 

Interpretations from the perspective of cultural studies suggested that the configurations of modern architecture, beyond its phenomenology, do not confront typical binary opposition postulations, which most interpretative traditions are based on. Instead, they serve to fulfill cultural roles and are open semiotic fields through which a community produces a desirable (moving) self-image.
