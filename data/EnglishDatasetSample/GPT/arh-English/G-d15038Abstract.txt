The significance of these research topics is indicative of the need to reevaluate the understanding of nature in architecture, in line with current environmental and climate issues, and the evolving perception of nature in modern culture. The paper, drawing from Lefebvre's view that a complete environment is always socially produced and the blurred lines between nature and culture in our era, argues for a shift in focus from objects in space to the ongoing production of space in the research and enhancement of the concept of nature in architecture. It posits that the production of space cannot be separated from the production of nature, as space, time, and place are relationally defined by processes that concurrently define and shape the environment. The relationship of space-time cannot be examined independently of the processes invoked in environmental and ecological actions. Given that architecture and urbanism create the human environment and study the relationship between people and their environment, the paper argues that architectural design is central to the issue between humans, the environment, and the changes in these relationships. The role and importance of the environment, both natural and built, its relationship with the user, and the interplay of natural and artificial are among the most relevant topics in contemporary architectural theory and practice. Recent decades have consistently highlighted the importance of behavioral knowledge and interpretation in architectural theory for achieving environmental and cultural sustainability, or harmony between architecture, nature, and users. However, there is still a lack of established practice for applying these methods and knowledge in architecture. Therefore, the primary aim of the research is to study the quantitative and qualitative changes in the relationship between architecture and nature. The research employs environment-behavior theories and knowledge to bridge the gap between isolated individual behaviors and synchronize personal interactions. The text begins with the assumptions that architecture is not only about designing space, but also about establishing relationships within this space, and that the implementation and application of behavioral knowledge in architectural practice contributes to the intensification and improvement of these relationships. In line with the need to reassess existing and explore new forms of relationships of architecture to nature, the operational objective of the research is to examine the possibilities of improving the relationships between architecture and nature in the dominant discourses of architecture and to create a basis through which the topics proposed by contemporary environmental-behavioral approaches could be examined. The assumption is that architectural practice can continuously improve its response to aspects of the environment, climate and place, as well as to the needs of contemporary society and culture, to the unpredictability of human behavior and characteristics of the local context. The selection of residential settlements for the research subject is defined by taking into account the complexity of the relationships between man and nature in residential architecture. Residential settlements enable a comparative study of the mentioned relations at different spatial scales, from the level of housing unit, to the level of neighborhood and block, both in the inner and outer space. In addition, such a choice of research field includes the study of local context, as an important aspect of environmental design approach. The general methodological approach, i.e. the basic theoretical orientation of this research, corresponds to the nature of the theme, or to the complex and transdisciplinary study of the spatial relations between man, architecture and nature, as well as to the entirety of the environment and the inseparability of nature and culture as its component parts. The dissertation makes use of the relevant theoretical paradigms of environment- behavior studies, determinism and interactionalism to explain the existence of different forms of architectural thinking about users, but also the entire environment (natural and built). The research was conducted through comparative analysis of given design positions and concepts of contemporary environmental architecture, an analysis of design positions in residential architecture of Belgrade, as well as the analysis of the relation of relevant environment-behavior phenomena and spatial levels. In this way, the dissertation shows that architectural practice for the given period includes two different modalities of architectural action in terms of environment- behavior paradigmatic positions, each of which assumes different qualities in relation to nature and the user. These two modalities are based on the deterministic and interactional paradigm, and generally correspond to the periods of modernism and post- modernism in Yugoslavia. The text elaborates on the difference between determinism and interactionism in architecture, that is, between a conceptual shift from the unidirectional and deterministic impact of the environment on people to a more complex interactional concept and the recognition that the relation between people and their physical environment is not as direct and causal as the deterministic paradigm suggests. What this elaboration shows is that the role of the environment-behavior theory in the architecture of this period is reflected in the complexity of user needs in architecture and the overall complexity of the environment. Further, the research shows that the residential architecture of Belgrade, and Yugoslavia in general, has a rich environmental history, which is due to specific historical conditions, resulting in complex, hybrid forms of approaches to the design of the environment. The architectural practice of the analyzed period clearly demonstrates the necessity for improvement and the need to raise awareness of the importance and role of environment-behavior knowledge in architecture; however, it also shows the limitations, the inability of adequate implementation and the narrow achievements of environment-behavior positions in the architecture of this period. Ultimately, the research shows that the concept of environmental architectural practice presupposes the establishment of a sensitive relation to the specific climatic and ecological, social and cultural context, and includes the use of various environment- behavior theories and methods in architectural design. Thus, the evaluation of the results indirectly suggests possibilities for improving the conception of nature in architecture, as well as the necessity of shifting the focus to a standpoint of transactional paradigm in the context of contemporary architectural theory and practice. A potential model for this is the concept of Third Nature. According to the concept of Third Nature, improving the concept of nature in architecture is founded on the adaptive logic of architectural practice, revealing the possibilities of transformation, expansion and improvement of environmental discourse in architecture, thus intensifying the relations between users, architecture and nature, which are impossible to consolidate within the common notion of the current conceptions of nature in architecture.
