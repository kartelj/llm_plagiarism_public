The doctoral thesis explores the relationship between concept and percept in architecture, based on the universal principles of assemblage thinking, a philosophy initiated by Guilles Deleuze and Fčlix Guattari. This philosophy was further developed and applied in various contexts by theorists such as Мanuel De Landa and Kim Dovey. The study uses the phenomena of place and becoming to examine assemblage from various perspectives, interpreting it as a whole formed by the interconnections of its constituent parts. Assemblage thinking focuses on the relationships between these parts, rather than the parts themselves. As such, assemblage is seen not as a product of things, but of their relationships and connections, capable of producing a new reality. This capacity is central to the application of assemblage ideas in the study of concept-percept relations in architecture. The thesis views architecture as an assemblage of concept and percept, shifting the discourse from separate consideration of conception and perception to their interaction and connection. This shift results in a loss of the singular focus of the architectural concept on perception modalities. Instead, the study emphasizes the emancipatory aspect of architecture, discussing conception and perception through their symbiosis, or assemblage, and their potential for change within it. The main hypothesis of the thesis is that the assemblage of concept and percept in architecture is based on otherness, poetics of intensity, autotelicity, (trans)culturality, and embodiment. The thesis aims to examine the conditions under which the concept-percept assemblage is formed through theoretical studies, case studies, and analyses of each characteristic and their interrelationships. A thorough analysis of these conditions from various perspectives, using specific examples of architectural concepts, identified the universally applicable aspects of the assemblage approach. The structure of the thesis, shaped by various research methods such as primary and secondary source analysis, case studies, comparative methods, and logical argumentation, provides a theoretically and practically applicable platform. This platform reflects the relevance and contribution of the thesis and can serve as a theoretical basis for critical architectural observation or practical application in architectural design. The assemblage, when applied to the concept-percept relation in architecture, can be a theoretical tool, a methodological approach to design, or a concept-percept event itself. The thesis, through this theoretical discourse, enables individual operationalization in architectural design and helps assemblage thinking transcend theoretical frameworks and become a practical tool in everyday life.
