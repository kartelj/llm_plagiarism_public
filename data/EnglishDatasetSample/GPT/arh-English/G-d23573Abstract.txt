This study investigates the interplay and mutual reliance among sustainable architecture, health tourism, and salutogenic spaces. The goal is to develop a comprehensive, integrated design model that incorporates key principles from all three areas. Applying this model to the renovation of existing health tourism buildings, particularly those constructed in the latter half of the 20th century like the Institute for Physical Medicine, Rehabilitation and Rheumatology “Dr Simo Milosevicž in Igalo, would greatly enhance these facilities. The primary considerations for all three areas are health preservation and well-being, and sustainability, with a focus on environmental preservation over economic and socio-cultural aspects. 

In the realm of sustainable architecture, the health impact is examined through environmental preservation and comfort provision, using passive design measures. In health tourism, the main motivation for travel is health preservation or enhancement, making it crucial for health tourism destinations. The primary goal of creating salutogenic spaces is to improve the health of facility users. 

Sustainability is examined through bioclimatic design measures and principles of humane design in sustainable architecture; through sustainable development of health tourism, which includes preservation of natural healing factors and the environment, low-carbon tourism, and tourist satisfaction; and as a key principle in creating salutogenic spaces. 

In the area of salutogenic spaces, evidence-based design and contextuality are important topics of analysis. The analysis of all three areas resulted in a synthetic model for evaluating health tourism centers, using the salutogenic environment as a reference point and including sustainable architecture and health tourism as subcomponents. 

This model includes goals, criteria, indicators, and recommended measures for evaluating health tourism centers, providing a foundation for a case study on the existing spatial, ecological, functional, and health tourism capacities of the Institute in Igalo. The goal is to identify potential improvements for future renovations of the Institute by applying underused measures. 

The research aims to establish a new theoretical and practical design methodology for health tourism centers that integrates key contemporary design principles of sustainable architecture, health tourism, and creation of a salutogenic environment. This would facilitate the sustainable development of health tourism destinations and contribute to the creation of healthier, more pleasant, more humane, more inspiring, human-scale places and environments, significantly improving the health and well-being of users.
