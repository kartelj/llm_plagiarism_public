This study explores an architectural model as a system of spatial regularity that shapes architectural structures. These structures delineate LGBTQ spaces, separating and connecting them with the heteronormative environment in Belgrade. The focus is on the past two decades, marking the emergence of openly LGBTQ spaces in the city. The architectural division that links and separates these spaces also shapes the city's queer space as a whole.

Heteronormativity is viewed as an oppressive order that maintains a binary division among the population into straight men and straight women. Each group maintains its sex, gender, sexual orientation, practice, and social role in clear interdependence, contrasting with the other group. The term 'queer' is used to encompass all identities that deviate from heteronormativity. Queer space is not always heteronormative and offers numerous opportunities for identity creation. Due to heteronormative oppression, queer space is divided into areas of pressure and freedom.

The study aims to investigate the role of architecture in creating queer space during the early stages of LGBTQ identity normalization in Belgrade. The city's queer space is formed through self-organization and is largely ignored by local architectural institutions. Therefore, the research focuses on the spatial life and practices of the population, rather than institutional design and planning documents.

The study primarily focuses on gay and lesbian practices, performances, and lives, as these groups are most visible in liberation. The theoretical framework combines spatial practices of the body and lived spaces with architecture, based on Lefebvreâ€™s spatial dialectics. This approach offers a methodological framework that can relate spatial architectural models to the spatial practices and structures around queer spaces in the city.

The study analyzes the architecture as a tool of perception and orientation, following the concepts of Beatriz Colomina and Sara Ahmed. It also examines the representation of queer space through the use of architectural metaphors. The architectural structure in queer metaphors and the material space of the city around queer places are analyzed using a spatial model.

The study concludes that the model of inward peripherization is consistently repeated in the structure of LGBTQ places. This repetition can be interpreted in two ways: as a representation of queer space designed in speech, or as a production of LGBTQ identities. The study suggests that the development of queer space in Belgrade is a self-organized practice. It proposes further research and learning opportunities to begin planning and designing for LGBTQ communities within the local architectural discipline, aiming to create a more liberal city.
