Socialist realism is often viewed as a forced doctrine with oppressive features, typically contrasted with other styles or movements such as modernism, 19th-century styles, or proto-postmodernism. It's also seen as a confusing blend of vague aesthetic principles. The art history of Yugoslavia is further complicated by the Yugoslav-Soviet conflict, with a focus on the Yugoslav 'third way' - highlighting differences from Soviet practices and deviations from the supposed socialist realist aesthetic, which was never clearly defined in the Soviet context.

This study adopts the viewpoint of Soviet theorists who argued that socialist realism was not a style but a method of artistic production, and should not be analyzed based on its form. The characteristics of this method were influenced by several decades of Joseph Stalinâ€™s consolidation of power, which involved integrating political interests into all aspects of society, including the economy and private life. Changes in political strategies were reflected in artistic practice, which helped to build the political system.

The effort to establish a new socialist foundation for Yugoslav society involved the deliberate and systematic implementation of the Soviet economic and cultural model, tailored to specific historical, economic, political, and cultural conditions. The adoption of socialist realism was closely tied to the interests of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia, which initially supported it and then abolished it when foreign policy circumstances changed.

This study examines the evolution of the relationship between politics and art in Yugoslavia, following the Soviet model. It covers the period from pre-war debates among left-wing artists, through the planning and execution of the Five Year Plan after World War II, to the rejection of the Soviet model after relations with the West were restored in 1950. Rather than analyzing socialist realism in terms of form or focusing on the repression of artists, the study views it as a method of constructing and distributing power in the field of art.

The study looks at the interplay between Party directives and individual works, within the institutional framework and organization of construction and design practices, program characteristics of plans and projects, the building process, and architectural criticism and theoretical principles of technical arts and sciences. A comparative analysis of domestic and foreign events is expected to provide a deeper understanding of the complexity and totality of political action in the field of architecture and the social context, as well as the role of architectural practice in advancing the Party's political agenda. The study asks how the government used socialist realism to shape architecture, and how architecture in turn helped to build political power.
