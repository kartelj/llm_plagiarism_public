The paper scrutinizes the role of architectural Modernism as the framework that molds disciplinary knowledge, adopting a dialectical model marked by internal conflict. Modernism marked a significant historical turning point in the geometric features of a building, making a crucial transition from the representability of classical language to the abstract unity of form, space, and function. By setting universal standards, the movement aimed to transcend the differing conditions of architectural activity, formalizing its processes and endowing them with a systematic nature as the foundation for the formation of an independent discipline. Modernism was the epistemological building ground where the entire new order of practice was constructed, with its constructs surpassing the entirety of professional experience through historical narratives. The primary motivation of the dissertation is the disparity between the internal viewpoint of the creative process and the external, objective states of architecture that make up the entirety of professional reality. In the evolving conditions of time, the concepts of architectural discourse retained an abstract and dialectical nature, losing the terminological accuracy and clarity of language, as well as the ability to distinctly delineate the phenomena of the immediate professional environment. The present context not only destabilizes the methodological authority of the process that architects could still depend on at the end of the previous century, but also any form of consistency that would serve as the foundation for the constitutive difference of contemporary architectural form. Its liberation from the obligation to express social and historical values does not offer our contemporaries a genuine chance to be guided solely by their own imagination and responsibility in design, or to freely reevaluate their architecture from the ground up, without the need for a society from which they could draw creative inspiration. While computer-based techniques and technology grant an individual unimaginable productive capabilities, the realm of values becomes ambiguous and elusive, unformed and subject to reevaluation that can occupy an architect's entire professional life. The challenge of contemporary architecture is the privatized notion of originality, which necessitates finding unique patterns on a case-by-case basis, with the responsibility for any potential failure resting solely on the creative subject. The distance and transience of the systematic structure, coupled with a vague, elusive environment with ever-changing demands, are incompatible with the abstract nature of the disciplinary meta-language and its universal terms where dialectical narratives are still entrenched. Position, projection, form, and style are key elements for the structure of the work, serving as the vertical pillars through architectural discourses of historical periods. They are viewed as fundamental concepts of architecture, as they indicate its essential contents within definitions that have evolved over time. The analysis of terms begins with the exploration of the etymology of identified words, to ascertain their form and meaning that reveal the historical locations of discursive transformations. The dissertation seeks to interpret the epistemological conditions of architectural activity by finding anchors in the social history of architecture, relying on the methods of comparative art theory that manage to distance itself from formalistic aesthetics. The primary assumption is that the difficulties in describing the current professional status can theoretically be pinpointed solely through a critical examination of the references established by the Modern Movement. The "deconstruction" of the narratives through the creation of new ones that adapt more comfortably to the current state cannot resolve the discursive crisis, which is more extensive and deeper than the visible range of professional theory and critique. The debatable position of architectural modernism pertains to the demarcation of identity figures that are most directly impacted by the loss of historical focus, but continue to shape practice in its spectral form.
