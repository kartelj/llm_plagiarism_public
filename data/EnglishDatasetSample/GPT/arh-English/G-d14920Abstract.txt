The growing use of free-form architectural structures, curved glass, and glass as a building material, coupled with the demand for more transparent building envelopes, necessitates a comprehensive analysis of geometrically complex glass envelope elements, particularly curved glass. This doctoral dissertation explores the possibilities and constraints of using (curved) glass in the construction of geometrically complex building envelopes, aiming to achieve diverse, economically viable, and physically and technically sound solutions. It also considers energy and, to some extent, structural characteristics. 

The research begins with an examination of the role of architectural geometry in designing the glass envelope and an analysis of various case studies, leading to the development of a typology of geometrically complex glass envelopes and the geometry of the glass elements used and analyzed. A survey method was used to identify the elements and stages of designing and constructing a geometrically complex glass envelope. This was followed by the creation of a process map and its validation by key participants, which is the primary contribution of this research. 

Detailed examination of hypothetical models was conducted to investigate the geometry of the form and materialization of each panel, as well as the entire glass envelope where curved glass was used. The designs, technological and economic characteristics of these hypothetical models were analyzed based on pre-set criteria to determine the potential and limitations of glass application. The findings were cross-referenced, thoroughly interpreted, and recommendations for using curved glass in building envelope materialization were established.
