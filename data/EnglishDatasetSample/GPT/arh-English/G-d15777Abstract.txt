This study aims to explore the connection between architecture and territory, focusing on how landscape configuration changes due to processes within both fields. The research was prompted by the need to consider both the city and the object in architectural and urban design processes. The doctoral dissertation proposed here investigates the role of architectural and urban space production in shaping landscape configuration during city territory development. This is examined through a detailed study of the transformation of Belgrade’s landscape configuration in the latter half of the 20th century. 

The goal of this research is to create a new model for future landscape configuration transformations, based on past experiences and current development trends. The research begins by setting the theoretical framework and focus for examining the relationships within the cognitive triad of landscape, territory, and architecture. 

In the context of this research, the architectural gesture plays a crucial role in shaping the city territory and transforming the landscape configuration. The study views landscape more as a process than a product, with the coding of its structural elements, such as architecture, being crucial for understanding changes and development within established territories. 

The research examines the processes of defining landscape configuration through various operational scenarios described by theoretical concepts of physical and social space production. These result in spatial manifestations of landscape configuration elements during city territory development. These manifestations are cultural artifacts with clearly defined positions and influence within the structure. 

The study also explores architectural and urban functioning as spatial and programmatic gestures and the potential of networks, borders, and differences within the operational categories of spatial situations. The aim is to establish relationships from point to field, or from an element to the whole configuration. 

The landscape configuration is examined through the lens of architectural topography and the totality of constructed and natural elements, with the goal of creating a productive system. The research views the landscape as a text, using concepts from philosophical and linguistic discourses, such as (post)structuralism and de-territorialisation, to establish guidelines for reading the spatial narratives of the city and its layers of development. 

The study also analyzes possible techniques for representing the transformation of landscape configuration during city territory development, from topographical to digitized approaches. The research then applies these concepts to examine the transformation of Belgrade’s landscape configuration in the second half of the 20th century. 

The research concludes by examining potential models for future landscape configuration transformations, explored through various interventions of varying durations and spatial coverage. The aim is to establish a relationship between nature and the structures within it, viewing the contemporary city as a transformed and reconstructed landscape.
