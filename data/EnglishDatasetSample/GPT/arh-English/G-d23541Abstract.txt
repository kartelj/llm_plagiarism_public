The study focuses on examining the role of open spaces in healthcare facilities and their impact on the quality of stay for all types of users. The research was prompted by the overlooked importance of these spaces in both scientific and practical contexts. The study primarily investigates how the spatial features of these open spaces affect the quality of residence. It proposes three hypotheses: open spaces enhance the quality of stay in healthcare facilities by positively influencing the physical and mental health of users, and the quality of stay is dependent on the presence of these open spaces. The research employed a multiple case study method, examining three secondary and tertiary healthcare facilities in Belgrade. The research methodology combined theoretical and empirical approaches, using both quantitative and qualitative methods, with a focus on surveys and interviews. The findings confirmed all the proposed hypotheses, highlighting the significance of open spaces for healthcare users and establishing a link between the spatial features of open spaces and the quality of stay in healthcare facilities. This research contributes to the understanding of health and open spaces, urban design, landscape architecture, and environmental psychology. It also provides practical design recommendations for open healthcare spaces to enhance the overall quality of stay in healthcare complexes.
