The evaluation of the quality of wooden structures primarily involves testing their static strength and stability. This type of evaluation necessitates on-site testing and due to the specific technical aspects of mechanical testing, it primarily relies on non-invasive methodological approaches. The high standards required for testing architectural objects of cultural and historical importance, particularly in terms of preserving their integrity and authenticity, guided this research towards developing a reliable non-invasive method for this purpose. The establishment of such a method required calibration as there was no direct equivalence between mechanically and non-invasively determined parameters for the hardness of built-in wood. Ultrasound and stress waves, commonly used in non-invasive evaluation of wood's mechanical potential, only allowed for the calculation of the dynamic elasticity modulus based on wave propagation speed. To obtain the static elasticity modulus and correlate parameters of different testing modalities, simultaneous mechanical testing of the specific wooden material was necessary. The adaptation of the stress sound method for testing wood hardness, using the analogue principle of directing pressure force and sound waves in line with wood fiber direction, resulted in the equalisation of sound propagation speed and wood hardness parameters. This led to the establishment of a method for on-site evaluations of the hardness of load-bearing elements in wooden architectural structures, by comparing it with a standard based on strain limits (JUS U.C9.200/300), in line with the type, class, and dimensions of the timber. Given that the adaptation of the stress sound method was performed on test tubes cut from healthy wood with specific hygroscopic moisture, on-site evaluations of load-bearing structural elements could be conducted based on known sound propagation speed values in healthy wood. Our research results, based on the spectral analysis of sound wave propagation, indicate that their application allows for a direct evaluation of the hardness of load-bearing wooden beams and, consequently, a direct evaluation of the structure's stability, thereby fulfilling the aim of this research.
