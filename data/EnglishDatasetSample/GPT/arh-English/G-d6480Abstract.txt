This doctoral dissertation contributes further to the exploration and study of architectural aesthetics and theory. It is framed within the scientific aesthetics of architecture, a concept established by Serbian architect and aesthetician, Milutin Borisavljevic, in the second decade of the 20th century.

Borisavljevic, an architect, theorist, critic, aesthetician, and scientist who studied optical and physiological phenomena, left a substantial legacy. His body of work includes over 130 buildings, nearly 100 unrealized projects, drawings, sketches, 20 published books, more than 170 scientific papers, and numerous critiques published in Serbian and French newspapers, collections, and magazines.

The motivation behind this dissertation is the fact that Borisavljevic's diverse and extensive creative work remains largely unexplored. There has been no comprehensive scientific study on Borisavljevic and his scientific aesthetics of architecture. While some authors have partially analyzed his architectural design work in the form of brief studies, his theoretical concept of scientific aesthetics of architecture has not been fully explored.

Despite several researchers highlighting the global significance of Borisavljevic's work in aesthetics, his substantial contribution to architectural aesthetics has been largely overlooked and underappreciated in his local environment.

It is often stated that Borisavljevic's aesthetic theory is valuable and significant, contributing to his global recognition. However, there is little understanding of what exactly his scientific aesthetics of architecture entails. What is the nature of this field or type of aesthetics? What issues does it address? This doctoral dissertation aims to answer these critical questions and more.
