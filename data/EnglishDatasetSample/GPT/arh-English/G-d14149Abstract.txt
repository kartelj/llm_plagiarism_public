The thesis focuses on Urban Aesthetics, exploring its foundations, principles, and their application in urban planning and design. It aims to improve the aesthetic quality of urban landscapes, particularly in Belgrade, where urban practices are often chaotic and aesthetically lacking. The research is comprehensive and systematic, focusing on aesthetic analysis for regulation and the aesthetic aspect of regulation itself. 

The study reveals that Belgrade's urban landscape lacks a controlled, aesthetically pleasing aesthetic, leading to the hypothesis that the methodology for aesthetic analysis and implementation of aesthetic criteria in urban planning is not clearly defined. The study also suggests that the preliminary aesthetic analysis and the aesthetic aspect in regulation are minimally applied. 

The study contributes to urban planning, design, and aesthetics by providing scientific knowledge and systematization. It emphasizes the creative process of analysis, planning, and regulation that shapes the urban landscape and explores the implementation of urban aesthetics in Serbia, particularly in Belgrade. 

The research also develops objective criteria for analysis and synthesis, which are defined and systematized from aesthetic principles and principles related to movement, cultural, and social conditions. These principles are crucial for evaluating the aesthetic quality of the urban landscape. 

The research methodology aligns with the complexity of urban aesthetics, using methods such as document analysis, data synthesis, case study, comparative method, descriptive method, and critical analysis. The results of the research include a theoretical framework of urban aesthetics, systematization of aesthetic principles, and a summary of aesthetic criteria for regulatory purposes. 

The study concludes with an analysis of the practical application of the results in Belgrade's urban planning practice. It addresses the importance of urban aesthetics and its implementation in shaping urban landscapes. The study is both theoretical and practical, providing a scientific and practical contribution at several levels. It aims to assist planners, urban designers, architects, social scientists, and policy makers in understanding and improving the aesthetic quality of the urban environment.
