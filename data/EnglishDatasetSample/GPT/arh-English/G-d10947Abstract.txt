The thesis, "Valorization of the modernist heritage, on the example of residential architecture in Belgrade at 1947 to 1967 in Belgrade", was expanded into a dissertation at the University of Belgrade's Faculty of Architecture in 2006. This work was based on extensive research in the fields of technology, design, and the history of Belgrade's modern architecture, as well as practical experience in housing design and construction, including renovations using precast systems. The study also evaluated architectural achievements that defined the era.

The research used a socio-historical methodology and raised hypotheses about the complex era under study, including its socio-cultural, technological, and economic aspects. The evaluation of modern residential architecture was based on methodological principles that have proven relevant in many countries and have guided the establishment of evaluation criteria. The dissertation contributes to the development of a methodology for evaluating modern culture.

The study paid special attention to the social context of mass production and analyzed social movements, political situations, demographics, migration, and economic development. It also examined housing policies and their relationship with the development of prefabricated building systems and mass housing construction.

The dissertation addressed several key issues in residential construction, including the political implications of architectural forms, the impact of housing function on modern architecture, and the use of precast systems in social housing. It also discussed whether certain types of settlements and social groups can be associated with specific types of prefabricated housing construction systems.

The study also reviewed contemporary art practices of the period, particularly in sculpture, painting, and other visual arts, as well as mass culture. It explored whether prefabricated buildings reflected contemporary artistic expressions.

The dissertation acknowledged the influence of foreign ideas and practices, facilitated by the exchange of literature, scientific and professional books, translated texts, and exhibitions of contemporary artists and architects. It also noted the impact of professional specialization and study tours to foreign academic centers.

The study found that housing policies were not consistent or long-lasting but changed over time. This led to changes in the relationships among stakeholders, including investors, building directorates, large enterprises, and customers. The dissertation analyzed these relationships and their impact on the location of residential areas.

The dissertation provided a detailed typology of housing construction and evaluated selected examples. It discussed the impact of prefabrication on urban structures and the relationship between functional areas and zones in a dwelling. It also examined the relationship between kitchen size and room number and analyzed standard solutions for bathroom-kitchen blocks.

The study reviewed dominant housing units during different periods and drew parallels with the traditional organization of Belgrade apartments. It also discussed the cultural valorization of modern residential architecture and advocated for the institutional protection of representative examples.

The dissertation concluded with a summary of the main elements and results of the research. It also included an extensive catalog of architectural components and residential units built in Belgrade using industrialized precast systems. The dissertation also developed a concept of remodeling and discussed the potential of software to analyze the spatial organization of residential buildings.

The appendix included representative photos and catalogs showing the most characteristic examples of architectural components and residential units built using industrialized precast systems.
