The Elliptic Hyperboloid of One Sheet (EHOS) is a double-curved surface from the family of ruled surfaces. It is generated by ruling a line along three directing skewed lines in space. This study provides a new method for creating geometric boundaries for this surface in spatial settlements. 

The research explores a variety of constructive procedures to determine the main parameters of EHOS, such as the center of the surface, orthogonal axes, symmetry planes, and the minimal section curve. These procedures are based on the concept of a hexagramic spatial carrier of two sets of three directors or skewed lines. 

The study uses Projective Synthetic Geometry, Descriptive Geometry, and computer graphics tools in a 3D environment (using Auto CAD software for engineers). These tools are crucial for the scientific contributions of this dissertation, which include constructive procedures and theoretical conclusions in the field of ruled surface EHOS geometry and its types. 

The research also investigates spatial affine transformations of hyperboloids of one sheet, where the directing lines are inscribed in three-sided prisms. The invariants of all types of transformations are determined. Further research is initiated on the relationships between general and special types of HOS within the same family of surfaces. 

The study analyzes all types of EHOS sections, including their correlation to the polar properties of the surface. The results provide a theoretical basis for the practical application of the entire surface or its fragments in 3D geometric modeling. 

3D models are created using fragments of straight or inclined EHOS. These models serve as prototypes for potential architectural shapes of roofs or buildings. Similar results are obtained from research on the intersections of EHOS and basic second-order surfaces such as cones, cylinders, and spheres. 

The research results are implemented in two applications in the Auto CAD engineering software, which uses circular sections of EHOS to generate wireframe or realistic surface models. The use of these sections is crucial for construction practices that require simplicity while maintaining aesthetic value. 

This dissertation highlights the importance of educational contributions, as it suggests new geometric-constructive settings for the practical use of geometric surfaces.
