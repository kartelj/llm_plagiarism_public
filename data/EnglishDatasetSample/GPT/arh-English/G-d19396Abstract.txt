The primary objective of this study is to identify and understand the principles of architectural tradition, and to examine if and how these principles can be incorporated into modern design processes. This analysis is based on examples selected from the vast repository of traditional folk building creativity in the current Republic of Serbia and the broader Balkan Peninsula. The study reveals how people have historically built and constructed in accordance with climatic conditions, soil characteristics, flora, and their own needs and cultural traditions. The work defines universal characteristics, principles, and models that can be applied beyond their original context.

The secondary objective is to explore the potential for applying these recognized principles of architectural tradition in contemporary urban planning and architectural design. The final section of the study focuses on the practical possibilities of integrating traditional building practices into modern architectural practice. The primary method used in this study is analytical, supplemented by descriptive, structural, historiographic, comparative, and intuitive elements when analyzing individual examples of traditional architecture.

The study not only provides information on traditional building types, but also on spiritual creativity, rituals, religion, tradition, inherited customs, and unwritten rules for building houses and other structures. The analysis of group and individual buildings, by linking the builders' response to the existential needs of the population under cultural and spiritual influences, has led to the crystallization of principles based on known concepts and relationships, now understood in a different but complementary way compared to ethnology and the protection of traditional building practices.

Field studies, where the author was able to directly interact with building structures largely identified in literature and a smaller number of buildings identified by the author during his own field investigation, have been particularly beneficial. The most notable outcome of the research is the 57 principles of architectural tradition from the current Republic of Serbia and its immediate vicinity, each illustrated with corresponding graphic examples or photographs.

These principles confirm the first hypothesis of the study, that almost every local builder's work is fully integrated into the environment and represents a response to the specific climate of a given area. The vast repository of building forms of traditional folk building is a source of new knowledge, although it is partly unknown and will be insufficiently present for new generations of researchers as it slowly fades away both in the field and in people's consciousness.

Familiarity with architectural tradition offers the possibility of modern implementation of these principles in today's architectural design practice. According to the ideas of sustainable development, it is essential to reassess both the starting points and the goals of the modern design procedure, both in practice and in the education of future architects. The educational system and modern communication should provide the opportunity to develop awareness of architectural identity and architectural tradition as an integral part of an irreplaceable and non-renewable cultural resource.

The goal of this paper is to promote the systematic, ongoing, and organized study and contemporary use of the principles of architectural tradition. This task would be best accomplished within an existing or future institution. This work would also have a socially engaged role, and the study of architectural tradition and its possible contemporary implementation would have the character of a permanent movement that would engage various types of researchers from all parts of the country, from students to scientific authorities, on the same principles.

The research shows that at least one third of the total number of processed principles of architectural tradition is directly implemented within the contemporary design process. The implementation of these principles in contemporary design and construction would positively impact the overall quality of the built environment in Serbia.
