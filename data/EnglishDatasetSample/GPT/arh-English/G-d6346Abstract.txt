This study explores the potential of the urban design process to integrate various interests and values in urban regeneration. The process is marked by several interconnected dimensions: subjective-imaginative, communicative-social, interdisciplinary, and technical-technological. The communicative-social dimension raises the question of how the other dimensions can be used to overcome communication barriers, which is vital for integrating values in urban regeneration. The primary hypothesis is that a multidimensional urban design process can facilitate greater integration, which is crucial for affirming cultural-historic ambiental values and creating new ones in devastated urban areas lacking valuable heritage.

The research focuses on the urban design process, examining its nature, phases, elements, and techniques in the context of sustainable urban regeneration. Urban design is explored as a process that integrates spatial-physical, technical-technological, economic, social, and environmental dimensions in urban regeneration. The research subject is viewed and discussed as a field where horizontal and vertical values can be integrated, defining the global and local identity of urban regeneration.

The main issue is the affirmation and definition of ambiental values in the urban design process, which are the focus of urban regeneration. The problem is theoretically examined in relation to the two dominant paradigms of urban decision making: instrumental-rational and collaborative. In a broader philosophical context, the problem lies in the heuristic field and questions the existence of universal values. On a practical level, the problem is associated with the research of the dominant discipline for urban regeneration, which lies between urban planning and urban design.

The key research questions are: Can the instrumental-rational and collaborative paradigms be integrated in the process of affirming and creating ambiental values? Which is the dominant discipline that should enable this integration, developing a multidimensional identity of space? The relevance of these questions lies in the fact that the network society introduces a new, often unstable and frustrating relationship between local and global identity.

The hypothesis is that the main problem lies in the barriers to open communication and communicative action, as proposed by Habermas. This hypothesis defines the research thesis: Urban design as a process can create conditions for open communication, building a creative and artistic environment by defining a dynamic model of the process. Therefore, the main hypothesis is that urban design as a process achieves a higher level of integration and improves the quality of urban regeneration.

The research aims to define the conditions for integrating cultural-historic and newly created values in the urban regeneration process, the elements of ambiental values in the multidimensional urban design process, the relationship between urban planning, urban design, and urban regeneration, and develop an integrative model of urban design for urban regeneration. It also aims to define the characteristics of such a model and the conditions under which the model functions.

The expected research outcomes include the systematization of current theories, approaches, concepts, and paradigms in urban design, urban planning, and urban regeneration, defining guidelines for using an integrative model of urban design, a compendium of possible methods and techniques for integrating different values and interests in urban regeneration, and defining a set for designing the process of integrative urban design in relation to the diversity of urban regeneration contexts.

The research's applicability lies in the development of urban theory and practice in the fields of urban design and urban regeneration at the local level, particularly important for Serbia's integration into the EU. The research aims to systematize different theoretical and conceptual approaches to urban design, planning, and regeneration, provide guidelines for designing the urban design process in different contexts, compile a compendium of possible methods and techniques for such a process, and define a set for choosing the appropriate ones.

The research method is based on a comparative analysis of different theories in urban decision making, urban planning, and design within the instrumental-rational and collaborative paradigm. The comparison will be guided by the process's potential and limitations in creating ambiental values and sustainable space. As a result of broader theoretical and philosophical consideration, a starting model of the urban design process will be defined. On a practical level, the method is based on the analysis of three examples (multiple case studies) that differ according to their spatial scale and the nature of the urban regeneration process. This diversity of cases allows for the examination of the openness and dynamism of the initial theoretical model in relation to changing urban contexts and the verification of the starting hypothesis. In this way, it will be possible to define general principles for integrative urban design in sustainable urban regeneration. Multiple case studies form the basis for verifying the starting hypothesis and the functionality of the theoretical model.
