This study contributes to the understanding of twentieth-century modern architecture and urbanism in Belgrade. It explores the design of public buildings based on modern architectural principles, a significant cultural phenomenon in Belgrade and the wider Yugoslav region from 1918 to 1941. During this time, public buildings were constructed using modern architectural and urbanistic principles. The study begins with an initial analysis of the modernist movement between the two World Wars in Europe and the influence it had on architects designing and constructing public buildings in Belgrade. The research includes a systematic and critical analysis of public buildings to determine the extent of modern Belgrade's representation in the architectural output of the time, and which European models were directly and indirectly adopted in terms of functional organization, architectural volume, design, and materialization. The study features a chronological, critical analysis of the most significant buildings constructed during this period. The research is based on the assumption that the design of public buildings in Belgrade incorporated modern and avant-garde ideas, which were established in the context of key historical, social, and cultural phenomena in Europe and Serbia. This research perspective assumes a correlation between the principles of modern architecture and their application by local authors, as well as a theoretical reflection on the changes brought about by the development of modern Belgrade, which fostered a new state and modern society.
