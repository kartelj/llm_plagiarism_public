This thesis examines the effect of shopping centres on the quality of urban environments. It has been noted that current consumption patterns significantly influence city planning, making the role of commercial spaces crucial for the immediate urban environment's quality. The study focuses on shopping centres as modern commercial spaces, which are key drivers of urban transformation and growth. The consolidation and intensification of public space functions, with all necessary amenities under one roof, result in the transformation of the existing urban area's built structure where the shopping centre is situated. The hypothesis is that the shopping centre's location and design impact urban development, space usage quality and intensity, leading to either improvement or, in some cases, degradation of the urban space. The shopping centre's effect on the urban environment is determined not only by the individual elements of their location and physical and functional characteristics but also by their integration level into the urban area. The study has confirmed the undeniable influence of these facilities on the urban environment's quality. The aim of this research is to enhance understanding of the shopping centre's impact on urban development and the quality of the urban environment. An in-depth analysis of shopping malls was carried out in this study to develop evaluation elements for the impact of shopping malls on an urban area's physical and functional structure in Belgrade, considering the social and symbolic values of these spaces. The objective of creating an evaluation model is to identify the type of shopping mall, in terms of functional and physical structure, that positively impacts a specific location. Recommendations for spatial-physical design and physical and functional integration into the urban environment have been developed through the evaluation model.
