This paper aims to highlight the role of the non-determined model in the architectural design process for sustainable social housing. It explores the sustainable aspects of social housing, focusing on cultural and social sustainability, through a comparative analysis of practical and normatively regulated aspects of social housing and contemporary architectural and urban competition work. The main issue identified is the over-determined structure of social housing architecture. The research seeks to understand conventional approaches to sustainable social housing design and the potential for residential structures to exceed their initial design purposes. 

The study focuses on defining the role of non-determined models in the design process, which can facilitate discussions on specific issues between integrated design process levels and project implementation. The study is divided into four parts. The first two parts are theoretical, based on personal argumentation and the analysis and systematization of primary and secondary sources. The third part is practical, conducted through a case study of a mixed-use social housing complex in Ovƒça. 

The design research is structured as an iterative decision-making process involving various stakeholders, including other winning teams, city administration, the Housing Agency, Urban Planning Institute, and the Transportation Institute CIP, which carried out the detailed project design. The project proposes an infrastructural system as a negotiation platform, transforming the idea of changing the building-use program from a problem into an integral part of the design strategy. 

The anticipated result is the application of the process outcomes in construction regulations, infrastructural framework positioning, design process opening, and housing construction. The study aims to establish a procedural practice for opening the design process when setting a minimum negotiation bar for all project participants. This approach allows for the overcoming of direct solutions to minimum conditions and structural pre-determinedness. The platform's potential lies in the iterative procedure that incorporates feedback into the design process. Through the mutual relations of all participants, social sustainability is stabilized, providing numerous solutions for a specific problem, thereby enhancing the quality and comfort of sustainable social housing.
