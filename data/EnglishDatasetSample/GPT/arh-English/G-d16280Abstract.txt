The research thesis focuses on the various sports facilities constructed in Belgrade during the 19th and 20th centuries. It begins with an overview of the first halls, followed by an examination of public baths, meadows converted into playgrounds and sports fields, velodromes and ice skating rinks, football stadiums, and Soko practice sites, which were the first system-built sports facilities. The study concludes with a look at modern sports centers and halls, reflecting the need to align with global sports facility architecture.

The architecture of sports facilities in Belgrade began to develop rapidly in the mid-19th century. As sports activities and competitions expanded, the importance of these facilities grew, leading to the construction of the first major playgrounds at the end of the 19th century. In the 20th century, the architecture of sports facilities evolved to keep pace with mass competitions and the expansion of the Soko movement. The aesthetic appeal of the buildings, which underwent various transformations, was also considered.

New concepts and forms emerged between the two World Wars, leading to the popularization of new, modern sports influenced by Western metropolises. This was reflected in the architecture. Post World War II, new architectural forms were developed to meet the needs of sports facilities. The 1960s and 70s are considered the golden age of sports architecture, with the most significant buildings in Belgrade constructed during this period.

Towards the end of the 20th century, construction began on the Belgrade "Arena", the largest sports hall in the Balkans, meeting all international standards for large halls for international matches.

The study is based on a thorough examination of primary sources, historiography, and discussions with architects involved in the construction of some sports facilities in Belgrade. It sets the frameworks for periodization, typology, and evaluation from the beginning of the 19th century to the end of the 20th century. The study emphasizes the influence of social, political, and cultural circumstances on the construction of these facilities.

The study also explores the role of sports facilities in cultural, social, and sociological aspects, as well as their visual identity. It highlights the significant impact of sports on society through various forms of competitions and events, and considers the topic of ideology through sport and mass participation.

Finally, the study points out the continuous development of sports facilities in Belgrade from the mid-19th century to the present, despite challenges such as wars and lack of funds. It suggests the need for valorization within the architectural history of Belgrade as a future research topic for architects and historians.
