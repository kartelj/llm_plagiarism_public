This doctoral thesis explores the emergence and contextualization of structuralism in Yugoslav architectural theory and practice from 1954 to 1980. The research aims to identify and categorize the theoretical factors that shaped the structuralist approach in architecture and urban planning, and highlight the adoption of structuralist ideas and methods in Yugoslavia's architectural and wider intellectual landscape during this period. The Yugoslav socialist society's politics, underpinned by a unique cultural concept that upheld the progressive ideas of the International and humanist Marxism, prompted the examination of architectural and urban culture using semiotics, historicism, dialectic, creativity, criticism, the renaissance of traditional cultureâ€™s humanistic values, and the creation of a synthesis of living space. The findings of this thesis suggest that the acceptance of the structuralist viewpoint of cultural phenomena significantly altered the prevailing functionalist approach in architecture when viewed in a broader social context. This confirms that structuralism, as an avant-garde movement, influenced critical thinking and the shift in functionalist principles and values in Yugoslav architecture and the wider culture of high modernism, establishing a new thought system that leaned more towards aestheticization, a formal and semiotic approach, and the creation of universal and archetypal values derived from the study of vernacular architecture of national experience. Unlike its dominant position in the West, structuralism in Yugoslav architecture was manifested through the approaches of a few architects and theorists, who prioritized improving living standards and humanizing the environment. Structuralist theory directly influenced the transformation in architectural practice and urbanistic ideas in Yugoslavia during the 1960s and 1970s, primarily in residential architecture, followed by hotel complexes, schools, residence halls, and cultural objects. The critique of the functionalist approach led to a shift in residential architecture in the 1960s and 1970s towards establishing a balance between the artificial urban structure and the natural environment, evident in the application of new and more humane concepts in the residential settlements of the period. The research findings indicate that despite being largely unrecognized in architectural history and theory disciplines, numerous theoretical works of Yugoslav architects, their competition solutions, and realized projects provide firsthand evidence and confirmation of the strong impact of structuralism on the development of Yugoslav architecture, urban culture, and society as a whole.
