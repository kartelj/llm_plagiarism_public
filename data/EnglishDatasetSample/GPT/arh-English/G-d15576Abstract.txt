The issue of not achieving profitability from planned regulations is prevalent in residential-business zones in Belgrade, where approved urban plans do not meet the demands of the real estate market. The economic valuation of implementing urban plans is essentially an evaluation of real estate investment. This dissertation delves into the crucial aspects of property investment, including its structure, timeframe, critical path, costs, and revenues. Urban parameters influence the cash flow throughout the different stages of the investment project. The profitability of this cash flow is assessed using both static and dynamic methods. The findings from these assessments reveal that variations in urban parameters significantly impact the profitability of the urban plan. The suggested profitability evaluation model is based on the investment process and its effectiveness is tested on various subjects. The evaluations conducted demonstrate the model's applicability across all levels and for each specific case. The profitability evaluation model for urban parameters of residential-business zones in Belgrade serves as a comprehensive solution for assessing the feasibility of planning decisions. Consequently, this model can be utilized as a decision-making tool in the planning process.
