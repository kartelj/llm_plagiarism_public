This thesis primarily investigates the role of architectural space as a medium of communication, emphasizing the profound interaction between the space and its user. The study delves into the user's experience of architectural space during this communicative process. Given that architectural space is characterized by various elements, either physically present or merely implied, these elements form the crux of this research, along with the perceptual attributes of the overall architectural composition. This involves exploring how the manipulation of architectural form elements and their interrelationships can impact the user's perception and utilization of the space.

The latter part of the research concentrates on the architecture of Christian sacred buildings from the latter half of the 20th century. Sacred architecture is a space where intense two-way communication between the user and the space occurs, and where design and ambiance are manipulated to evoke a specific spatial and spiritual experience. The shaping of architectural space creates a contemplative environment that embodies the transcendent and the "ineffable". Examples from this era offer insights into contemporary interpretations of sacred architecture and innovative methods of crafting expressive sacred spaces.

The objective of this study is to understand how architectural space influences the user and to anticipate the user's experience of its components or the entire space. The research process prioritizes sacred architecture as a testing ground for examining the manipulation of spatial experience. The study favors examples of architectural structures with refined expression devoid of decorative elements. The research aims to analyze and elucidate the use of understated architectural elements as the sole tools for constructing expressive and/or contemplative spaces.
