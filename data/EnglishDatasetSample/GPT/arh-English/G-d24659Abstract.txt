The study is situated within the realm of architectural design, with the goal of developing scientifically grounded design models to enhance the recreational value of neglected public open spaces. This concept is predicated on the belief that a connection can be established between the recreational value of neglected public open spaces and architectural intervention, and that the experiential potential of these spaces is crucial for enhancing their recreational value. A review of theoretical progress in architecture and related fields led to the identification of three distinct features of abandoned spaces - historical determinants, spatial character, and local authenticity. In the modern context, these traits are seen as experiential potentials. Additionally, the study acknowledges the importance of recreational quality as a key factor in evaluating the role of architecture in incorporating neglected public spaces into daily urban life. A comprehensive analysis of successful examples establishes the role of architectural intervention in creating recreational scenarios by breaking down the design process into steps and decisions. The study identifies specific groups of architectural interventions related to the experiential potentials of abandoned spaces by organizing the analysis results. As a result, a model is developed, serving as a design guideline, based on the experiential potentials of abandoned spaces as bearers of authentic architectural concepts. The work contributes to the enhancement of knowledge in architectural design theory by defining a model of spatial-program constellations to improve recreational quality. Additionally, it contributes practically by improving the design process methodology, expanding the scope of design activities in public open spaces, and transforming neglected spaces.
