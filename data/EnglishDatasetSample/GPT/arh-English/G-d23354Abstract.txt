The doctoral thesis explores the application of cultural and creative policies and their potential to serve as a foundation for the urban renewal of small municipalities. Policies for urban-economic development based on culture and creativity are widely accepted, but often implemented without critical analysis. These policies can be seen in concepts such as cultural and creative cities, industries, clusters, and tourism. They are typically associated with larger cities, but are increasingly being used in the development of smaller towns and settlements. Due to the lack of typical resources for cultural and creative policies in smaller areas, research suggests that viable models are based on tourism development, local features, and a specific "niche" offer. 

The initial hypothesis is that cultural and creative policies, based on the concept of clusters, can serve as a foundation for the urban renewal of smaller settlements. This is particularly relevant in the context of Serbia, considering the demographic and economic issues of small settlements and the consideration of implementing such policies in urban renewal. The second hypothesis suggests that the methods and models of cultural and creative policies can be linked to spatial, cultural, and social characteristics, as well as human resource characteristics, and that a policy that aligns with local conditions can be defined based on these. 

The municipality of Golubac was chosen as a representative example for this study due to its characteristics and the projects that have been or are being implemented there. The research was carried out using several scientific methods used in urban planning, with the main scientific method being analytical-synthetic, along with critical content analysis, logical arguments, deductive method, and case study method. 

The first part of the research includes a review of theoretical analyses of cultural and creative policies, their origins, definitions, term applications, related urban development phenomena and concepts, and the positive and negative results of their implementation. The second part of the research compares the properties of cultural and creative policies, cultural and creative clusters, tourism, and urban renewal. The third part of the research defines models of urban renewal by creative and cultural policies. The fourth part of the research provides reasons for selecting the case study, basic characteristics of the municipality of Golubac, and projects of cultural and creative policies that have been or are being implemented. 

The results of this research contribute to the field of cultural and creative policies in the function of urban-economic development. The research emphasizes the complexity of cultural and creative policies and the need for an analytical approach in their preparation and implementation. The practical contribution includes criteria and models that can be used in the preparation and implementation of various documents and projects, and that facilitate the establishment of relationships between cultural and creative policies, urban renewal, and local specificities.
