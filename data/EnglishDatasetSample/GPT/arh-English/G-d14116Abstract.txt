This study aims to enhance the process of designing open public spaces by applying principles of quantum architecture. The research extends into the realm of open urban dynamic systems, constructor theory, post-critical design phenomenon, non-place, acculturation, and mixed realities. The first section of the doctoral thesis examines quantum architecture, a relatively new spatial paradigm, and its connections to various theories, phenomena, and methodological tools. It critically analyzes works based on Christopher Alexander’s self-conscious and unselfconscious designing process, leading to insights on how users of the built environment approach architectural and urban design. It also scrutinizes Nicholas Negroponte’s Theory of Architecture Machines, which foresaw many current architectural processes and has potential links to quantum architecture. The research also delves into the phenomenon of open urban systems, focusing on Jay Forrester’s open dynamic system, the iteration process, and self-regulatory systems. It also investigates the post-critical design process, which fundamentally aligns with the process generated by quantum architecture. The thesis outlines John Lobell’s principles of quantum architecture, discusses the relationship between real, virtual, and quantum phenomena from an architectural perspective, and highlights mixed reality as a key tool for applying quantum architecture principles. It also explores the concept of a quantum city, emphasizing the role of the user, open systems, and the relationship between deterministic and nondeterministic processes in designing the built environment. The research then places quantum architecture in a social context, linking it to acculturation and non-place. The second part of the thesis delves into the theoretical aspects of open public spaces, examining public life, user attitudes, and the design process. It also explores the relationship between digital media, networked society, and urban space. The research pays special attention to the work of Jan Gehl and Bill Hillier, and attempts to reconcile their somewhat opposing approaches using quantum architecture. The research also draws on the theory of structuration by Anthony Giddens, and the work of Henri Lefebvre. The third part of the thesis defines models for applying quantum architecture principles in the design of open public spaces. It presents the basic concept and structure of David Deutsch’s philosophical constructor theory, and correlates it with open dynamic systems and the iteration process to define a model for applying quantum architecture principles in architectural and urban design. The final part of the thesis outlines methodological principles for designing open public spaces using predefined models of correlations between quantum architecture principles, constructor theory, and an open dynamic system. The research also explores the potential new roles of users and architects in a quantum architecture environment. The study contributes to the field of quantum architecture by establishing parallels with open dynamic urban systems, particularly by defining correlations between quantum architecture and constructor theory. The research also has potential social implications, particularly in relation to the sociological phenomena of non-place and acculturation. The practical application of the research is linked to the use of the model of open public space quantum architecture in mixed reality environments, which could be used in the design of various software applications for devices that display mixed reality environments. The study lays the groundwork for future research, which could involve refining the defined models or creating new ones with specific features depending on the territory they cover. The research also suggests that new roles for architects and users in the realm of quantum architecture could lead to changes in architectural education and the perception of architecture itself. This could lead to more active exploration of the connection between programming, coding, and architecture. The convergence of real and virtual spaces, which redefines time and distance, raises many questions that require further research in the fields of architecture, urban planning, technology, sociology, philosophy, law, and politics.
