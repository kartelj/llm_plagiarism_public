The attached doctoral dissertation primarily investigates the innovative language aspects of modern architecture that align with the evolution and impact of artistic practice on the rise and progression of kineticism and sculpturalism in contemporary architecture. The study selected and analyzed representative examples of kinetic modeling practices, kinetic architecture, and kinetic sculpturalism, with a detailed examination of the interplay between artistic and architectural practices on their kinetic and dynamic movement properties within the structure that embodies them.

The research primarily employed inductive analysis or theoretical logical analysis to interpret the aesthetic and visual characteristics of the development of kinetic and interactive architectural structures, which are the focus of this study. The dissertation contributes to the understanding of how artistic practices can enhance the innovative language of modern architecture and introduces new concepts that highlight the distinct characteristics of contemporary kinetic architecture.

The main research problem is the current lack of visibility of the relationship between contemporary sculpture and architecture. This necessitates further analysis of the relationship between sculptural practice and architecture to provide a clearer definition of the innovations that this relationship establishes in the language of modern architecture and its further development needs.

The study aimed to examine the aesthetics phenomenon and its historical development through the origin and evolution of kinetic art and its relationship with architecture. It also aimed to explore the potential for creative interpretation of past experiences to form future innovative concepts for improving existing models of aesthetic and 'responsive' thinking in archisculpture structuralism and identifying the occurrence of kinetic archisculpture. The study also explored the potential for further development of archisculpture structures through more applicable interpretations of their application within contemporary artistic practice experiences.

The research was conducted in three phases: The first phase clarified the concepts and defined the history of the relationship between kinetic sculptures and kinetic architecture. The second phase presented several interconnected units marked for further research areas, including the examination of philosophical concepts dealing with archisculpture and the role of archisculpture in contemporary architectural and artistic conceptions. The final phase reviewed the results of the previous research parts, considering new trends and possibilities for the development of contemporary kinetic architecture.

The research aimed to identify, classify, and recognize the roles of new trends in modern architecture when it successfully relies on sculptural practice and its experiences. The ultimate scientific goal of the research was to develop a deeper understanding of the values of artistic practice and the possibilities of its active participation in future development segments of creating new forms of kinetic and archisculpture structures.

The research did not aim to solve the problem, but to move and articulate it correctly, citing the increasingly frequent practice of questioning reality with aspects of fine art values and sculptural practice. The study also highlighted the strategic values of kineticism innovations as an artistic practice for the development of the anthropomorphic language of modern architecture. By defining the existence of kinetic archisculpture, the research developed a deeper understanding of the relationship between artistic practice and its impact on some innovative solutions of contemporary architecture.
