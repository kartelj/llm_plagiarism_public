This paper aims to address the issue of housing for the socially vulnerable Roma community, a process that evolves through the interplay of theory and practice, and is situated outside the traditional design profession within the context of a multicultural society. The lack of understanding of Roma lifestyle and housing principles results in a deficiency of methods and techniques for creating suitable housing designs. This paper will demonstrate how several interdependent features of the functional organization of Romanipen-based Roma communities embody the ethos of spatial structure formation and construction methods in unplanned Roma settlements in Belgrade, using a deeper comprehension of Roma housing principles.

The paper begins with a wider interpretation of territorialization, suggesting a relationship between the spatial and social aspects of Roma settlements. This relationship allows for an understanding of what this cultural group creates in space. The physical spatial patterns of informal Roma settlements, created without professional influence, represent a quality driven by the need to functionally organize a community where daily activities occur. Thus, the characteristics of spatial organization and construction methods in unplanned Roma settlements are the primary research focus when studying a collective lifestyle dictated by specific Romanipen principles.

The paper concentrates on identifying spatial expressions of two different degrees of Belgrade Romani collectives – the family and the community – in selected settlements that provide a representative sample due to their intra-settlement structures. The paper then compares research findings – a systematic review of physical structure characteristics and construction principles – with the preliminary framework of possibilities supported by existing, valid documents to articulate and categorize scientifically described facts on Romani housing as a usable database of programmatic principles.

The paper's primary objective is to highlight that Roma microenvironments already provide their own methods for participating in the creation of future cities. Defining programmatic principles through this process has a twofold effect: it guides architectural and urban design of lifestyle conditions acceptable to the Romani community, and it facilitates the design implementation of strategic principles for resolving housing for socially vulnerable Romani and, methodologically, other culturally diverse groups.
