The objective of this doctoral thesis is to introduce and elucidate the research method and work related to the specific aspects of critical regionalism in the realm of architectural theory and practice. The research particularly highlights the uncertain role of metaphor in the practice of critical regionalism, not only in relation to the almost dogmatic and ideological sanctity of modernism principles within the particular architectural discourse, but also in relation to the author's current position.

In this context, the significance of architect and professor Ranko Radović is underscored as a problem-oriented framework for the research. This is intended to highlight the symbolic, aesthetic, anthropological, philosophical, and historical model of metaphorical interpretation, presentation, and representation of data. Metaphor, as the primary method of critique and inquiry of the high modernism canon, was utilized to relativize and contextualize the prevailing paradigm of the time. The coherence of the meaning and the power of tradition hold a unique position in the research and have entirely shaped the nature of Radović's design process.
