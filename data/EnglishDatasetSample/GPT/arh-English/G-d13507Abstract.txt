A monastery is a combination of a physical structure, a sacred lifestyle, and the encompassing space where this lifestyle takes place. Monasteries, which always have a spiritual purpose, can also be recognized as cultural or natural properties, and may be classified as nationally significant or as a world heritage site. In Kosovo and Metohija, there are approximately 1500 sacred sites, including monasteries, churches, and cemeteries, that testify to the Orthodox spirituality and history of the Serbian nation over time. The unity of the Serbian state and church, achieved during the Nemanjic dynasty, is reflected in church art, unique architectural styles, and urban forms, with the church building always at the center of the churchyard, surrounded by other structures. Among the many significant monasteries in Kosovo and Metohija, fifteen stand out as particularly important to the Serbian Orthodox Church, the Serbian state, and both entities combined, as noted in the book Legacies of Kosovo and the State Negotiations in Vienna in 2006/2007. These monasteries have suffered destruction during the Ottoman rule, wars in the early 20th century, and attacks from the local Albanian population. After World War II, monastery property was seized by the new state establishment. Following the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia in 1999, the UN Resolution 1244, and the arrival of international forces, 129 sacred sites were destroyed in Kosovo and Metohija in ethnically motivated attacks. International missions confirmed the destruction of Serbian historical, spiritual, and cultural heritage, leading to the inscription of eight monasteries on the UNESCO’s World Heritage List. These attacks necessitated the establishment of protective zones around Serbian holy sites for their preservation. For the State Negotiations in Vienna in 2006, Serbian experts prepared a project for the protection of 39 complex cultural sites, including 24 monasteries. This was followed by the Ahtisaari Plan for religious heritage, which had some deficiencies in the establishment and monitoring of the zones. Despite these shortcomings, the international community supported the subsequent legislation on special protective zones enacted by the provisional institutions of Kosovo. The Ahtisaari Plan also supported the reconstruction of Serbian church buildings through a Memorandum, which the Serbian Orthodox Church signed twice with the provisional institutions of Kosovo, in the presence of UNMIK. The Council of Europe leads the implementation of the Memorandum. This thesis also examines the model of the reconstruction of the Banjska monastery throughout the 20th century, first through the restoration of the church building and later through the conservation of the architectural remains, without revitalizing the life in the monastery, which will occur only at the beginning of the 21st century. The preparation of the urban-planning project for the unified monastery, the settlement, and the spa of Banjska confirmed an integrative approach to the reconstruction of cultural heritage through cooperation between the Serbian Church and the Serbian state institutions. The establishment of the protective zones considered church rules from the Synaxis of Jerusalem in 50 A.D., through the Holy Canons of the Church and the monastic rules, to the contemporary Serbian legislation on cultural and nature heritage, urban planning and construction, and churches and religious communities. International conventions in the sphere of the protection of cultural, natural, and intangible heritage, UNESCO’s criteria on determining the universal values, and UNOSEK criteria used in the discussions within the State Negotiations held in Vienna were also considered. Three areas of protection have been established, with a possibility of their further division, all unified within the Liturgical function. These are the unchangeable protective zones of the monastery itself, protective zones surrounding the monastery, and special protective zones. The research also established the criteria for determining the protective zones through the questions of procedure and then the technical criteria for each of the three zone areas of protection individually. The establishment and management of the protective zones must be carried out with the full consent of the Serbian Orthodox Church and the institutions of the Republic of Serbia, with a harmonized application of the Holy Canons of the Church, the Serbian legislation, and international conventions. This complex process of establishing protective zones of the monastery requires the involvement of experts in the fields of art history, architecture, and urban planning, and especially those knowledgeable about monastic life.
