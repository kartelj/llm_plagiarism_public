The thesis explores the function of the comprehensive urban plan in Serbia's local development process following the democratic shifts in 2000. It is an empirical examination of urban planning and local management systems, with a particular emphasis on the comprehensive urban plan's role in guiding local development. The paper primarily investigates the influence of the general urban plan on the effectiveness and efficiency of spatial interventions, such as construction investments, infrastructure projects, and land use changes.

Despite the comprehensive urban plan's strategic and regulatory nature, there is often a disconnect between specific interventions and strategic objectives, leading to numerous instances of planning document misuse. The comprehensive urban plans, as currently implemented, do not adequately represent a framework for local development and often fail to align with local interests and expectations. The general consensus is that these plans are inflexible, inefficient, ineffective, and unrealistic in relation to requirements.

The paper's central research topic is the relationship between the comprehensive urban plan and the interests/expectations associated with local development in Serbia post-2000. The research is conducted within the local development process, where the guidelines and rules of comprehensive urban plans are translated into actual interventions. The analysis contributes to understanding the relationship between the urban planning system and local development management.

The neoinstitutional theory was chosen as the primary theoretical framework as it explains the construction, dissolution, and functioning of institutions. The collaborative planning model, combined with the rational model, forms the role of the comprehensive urban plan in Serbia.

The research aims to understand the role of the general urban plan for local development in Serbia and assess its suitability in the current management system. The main problem investigated is the relationship between the strategic and regulatory nature of the general urban plan and the ineffectiveness and inefficiency of spatial intervention in Serbia's local development management. The case study method was used, focusing on the use of the comprehensive urban plan in Belgrade and urban municipalities (Mladenovac).

The research confirms that master plans do not protect the interests of local development in Serbia, and their effectiveness depends on institutional factors in each case. Comprehensive planning remains a legal obligation, but it is not recognized as a strategic document or local development instrument by the government and local government stakeholders.

The research contributes to the integration of theoretical positions of neoinstitutionalism and its application in researching institutions, local development, and urban planning. It critically examines the role of the comprehensive urban plan for local development in Serbia, which has not been critically examined before. The research also contributes to the understanding of the role of the comprehensive urban plan as a legal framework and its application in daily practice.
