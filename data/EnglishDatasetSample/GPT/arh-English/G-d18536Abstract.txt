This thesis delves into the decision-making processes within the context of modern planning procedures, specifically looking at ways to enhance the relationships between participants in urban planning to achieve a valid decision crucial for spatial development. The study critically analyzes the principles of group deliberation, as the way participants are informed about the issue at hand, the exchange of views, and the nature of the discussion itself significantly impact the effectiveness of the modern planning process. 

The study of current trends in the decision-making process in Western European urban planning shows efforts to reach a consensus-based agreement, supported by communicative rationality, equality, and the consideration of all those potentially affected by the outcome of the urban planning decision-making process. 

Broadly, the research aims to explore ways to improve the modern planning approach in Serbia by considering the aspects and principles of group deliberation. More specifically, it critically evaluates the decision-making procedures during the alienation of public property, using the example of military brownfields. 

The research hypothesis suggests that the planning process for reusing military brownfields in Serbia includes elements of group deliberation that could enhance the action and decision-making within the formal planning process. This hypothesis originates from the idea of deliberation, or the potential to surpass traditional democratic voting procedures by reaching a consensus on an issue acceptable to all participants in the decision-making process. 

The theoretical part of the research focuses on the possibilities of achieving rationality during the decision-making process, through the perspective of deliberative democracy theory and the modern communicative-collaborative planning paradigm. 

The transformation of the planning process to include deliberative principles has been delayed in post-socialist and/or post-communist societies due to institutional rigidity, lack of public trust in spatial development initiators, and the absence of mediation procedures in the planning process. 

Despite the Serbian (Yugoslav) social context in the second half of the 20th century being based on self-government, changes such as the dissolution of the federal state, turbulent political regime shifts, and the complete overhaul of the legislative system, have impacted all areas of public life, including the organization of the planning process and spatially relevant decision-making. 

The current democratic transitional context in Serbia still lacks a clear vision for developing the planning process and a strictly defined methodology for decision-making in spatial and urban planning. Therefore, group deliberation is seen as a flexible tool for spatial governance in Serbia, due to its conceptual similarity to the modern communicative-collaborative planning paradigm based on consensus, equality, and the involvement of various participants in the decision-making process. 

The research also aims to shed light on the modern planning framework in Serbia, by reviewing planning policies from the Second World War to the present, through the lens of the decision-making approach. The ultimate goal of this dissertation is to define possible guidelines for transforming the urban planning approach in Serbia.
