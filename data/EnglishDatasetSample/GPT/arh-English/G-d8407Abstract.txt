This study provides an examination of architecture as a cultural entity that conveys messages in various ways. The concept of architectural communication was explored, drawing on information theory, semiotic principles, specifically those of Umberto Eco (architectural denotation and connotation), and modern communicology definitions of communication. The analysis of architectural communication was conducted through three types of relationships that a building forms with its surroundings: the social and physical context, the users (architecture usage), and the architect/author (architecture as a means of knowledge transfer). 

In the relationship between the building and the social context, connotative meanings are dominant, and information about the concept, construction, and subsequent modifications of a building is transmitted. The relationship between the building and the physical context is further examined in terms of the building's internal and external interactions with its physical environment. The analysis of the relationship between the building and the user focuses on the dynamic denotation of utilitarian space segments (denotative meanings). 

The examination of architecture as a "knowledge production field" - the relationship between the building and the author/architect - highlights those authors whose work has made a unique and innovative contribution to architectural theory and practice. These defined forms of architectural communication were applied to the analysis of cultural centers built in Montenegro in the second half of the 20th century, during the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia era. The study analyzed 27 buildings in 19 cities and towns across Montenegro, including community cultural centers, cinemas, memorial centers, revolution memorial centers, art galleries, youth centers, theaters, and Yugoslav National Army cultural centers.
