This study will concentrate on the use of new media and technologies in modern architectural practices. It will investigate how the use of new media impacts the creation of new values, opportunities, and phenomena in architectural space. The primary hypothesis of this study suggests that the use of new media in architecture has led to the creation of innovative, dynamic, and responsive technological models. The use of new media has brought about changes and innovations in the quality and function of architectural space, transforming the passive user into an active participant in the creation and shaping of architectural space. The 21st-century trend of miniaturization and smart systems in computer technologies has resulted in the development of new materials with radically new features and possibilities for constructing architectural space. In new media architecture, concepts of materials, technologies, media, devices, and systems intersect and overlap in the design of dynamic and responsive architectural environments. In this era dominated by various computer systems, this study aims to scrutinize and analyze in depth the use of new media in architectural practices, to understand the implications and future potential of their use in architectural space. The scientific contribution of this study lies in its comprehensive and systematic critical analysis and synthesis of existing knowledge in this emerging scientific field, which is still young and unexplored, as well as in establishing new scientific insights into the potential and implications of using new media in the conception, design, and development of architectural space.
