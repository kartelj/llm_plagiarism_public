This paper investigates the yearly energy efficiency of atrium-style hotel buildings in the climate of Belgrade. The study aims to understand how the atrium impacts the energy needs of the hotel for heating and cooling, and to assess the effectiveness of measures implemented to enhance the energy performance of a chosen model. The EnergyPlus simulation engine is used to generate energy performance results, considering Belgrade's climate data and thermal comfort parameters. The results are then compared and the hotels are ranked based on various single and multi-criteria. The ranking process involves the use of the PROMETHEE multi-criteria method, followed by the Borda model of group decision-making for the final ranking. The research methodology involves creating a hypothetical model of an atrium-style hotel building, simulating the energy efficiency of different design alternatives for the hotel with an atrium, comparing the results, and ranking the proposed models based on their energy performance. The analysis primarily aims to understand how the atrium's shape, position, orientation, and envelope structure affect the hotel's energy efficiency. The ultimate goal of this research is to identify the most energy-efficient model of an atrium-style hotel building for the climate conditions in Belgrade.
