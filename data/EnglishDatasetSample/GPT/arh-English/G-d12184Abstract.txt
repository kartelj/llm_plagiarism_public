The decline in the quality of newly constructed apartments in Serbia's housing market has been noticeable since Yugoslavia's dissolution in the 1990s. Changes in Serbia's socio-economic system meant that companies and organizations that previously invested in housing for their employees could no longer maintain this practice. The breakdown of the system for investment, construction supervision, and apartment allocation left families without housing to fend for themselves. This led to a crisis in the construction industry, with large, experienced construction companies weakening and smaller companies seeking quick profits emerging in the new construction market. The absence of organized monitoring and control of housing construction, from planning to construction, led to a decrease in apartment quality. Currently, buyers face a challenging task of assessing the overall quality of an apartment they intend to purchase, often making mistakes as the quality of an apartment can only be truly assessed after living in it. Incorrect apartment selection can lead to reduced comfort and a less healthy indoor environment, negatively affecting the occupants' wellbeing. Therefore, improving apartment quality in Serbia is crucial. Looking at advanced housing construction practices, such as the contemporary Dutch housing industry, could provide insight into improving apartment quality. The Dutch housing industry has achieved a high level of quality over the past few decades by considering their own housing tradition and learning from other successful housing practices worldwide. Comparative analyses of construction standards and better quality apartment models in Serbia and the Netherlands have led to conclusions about their qualitative differences. These analyses have resulted in a set of measures and activities aimed at improving the overall quality of apartments in the Serbian housing market. To further encourage improvement in apartment quality, a methodology for assessing overall apartment quality has been developed. This will help potential buyers better understand the quality of the apartment they intend to purchase. The result of this assessment methodology would be an overall apartment quality certificate, a mandatory document issued by an independent appraiser for every apartment sold on the market. This certificate would provide key information on the apartment's overall quality, guiding buyers towards better quality apartments. This increased demand for higher quality apartments will force larger investors and builders to focus on constructing higher quality apartments. This will provide citizens with apartments that offer adequate comfort levels and a healthy indoor environment, improving the country's housing stock.
