The study aims to investigate the role of urban planning in brownfield regeneration, a complex sustainable land-use mechanism. The unique aspect of brownfield regeneration lies in its financing, which requires both public and private funding. However, the private sector does not always show interest in investing in brownfield land. When they do participate, their interests can be challenging to manage. The key to success in this process is balancing public and private interests and integrating sector policies that focus on various domains such as traffic, environment, and local and regional development. 

The research focuses on evaluating the planning approach to brownfield regeneration, considering planning as a form of state intervention in the market. The primary research hypothesis suggests that collaborative planning models are more advantageous for this process compared to other models like the rational planning model. This is based on the belief that efficient decision-making about brownfield regeneration requires harmonized interests, synergy of knowledge and skills, and the involvement of interested parties. 

The study also hypothesizes about the role of planning expertise in brownfield regeneration. It assumes that successful brownfield regeneration is a direct result of the synthesis of expert knowledge and negotiation, facilitation, and mediation skills inherent in the collaborative planning model. 

The research also considers the transformation and adaptation of the institutional framework to the collaborative planning model. It presumes that an effective brownfield regeneration process requires a formal institutional framework that enables collaboration at various levels and the functioning of public-private partnerships. 

The research methodology is tailored to the research questions, hypotheses, and goals. It involves a multiple case study approach, analyzing brownfield regeneration in countries within the Danube basin. The research confirms that brownfield regeneration requires a collaborative planning model and that the collaboration of different sectors and the institutionalization of an informal planning approach contribute to successful brownfield regeneration. 

The research's contribution is twofold: it develops a theoretical and methodological approach for formulating principles in brownfield regeneration and provides practical insights into European and Serbian experiences with brownfield regeneration. It also offers efficient models for brownfield regeneration and provides guidelines for the process in Serbia.
