This doctoral research focuses on the ancient city of Viminacium, once the capital of the Roman province of Upper Moesia and a significant legionary fortress, now an archaeological site and park near Kostolac, Serbia. A multidisciplinary team from the Archaeological Institute and the Center for New Technologies Viminacium in Belgrade began work in the early 21st century, preventing looting, enabling ongoing excavations, welcoming the first tourists, and establishing a legal boundary with a nearby coal mine. The future protection and presentation of Viminacium should incorporate a holistic concept of cultural landscape, considering all natural, historical, cultural, and social factors. The dissertation proposes a concept that highlights the unique landscape, comprising not only physical remnants of buildings but also intangible values shaped by various contexts over time. This aligns with modern heritage protection doctrines that increasingly value cultural landscapes. The study encompasses the protected archaeological site and its inseparable surroundings, considering their economic, cultural, historical, social, and sociological interconnections. It was essential to investigate, comprehend, and valorise elements from all historical periods of the broader Viminacium area, leading to a new concept presenting it as a unique cultural landscape. Other archaeological sites, medieval fortresses, monasteries, traditional houses, industrial heritage from the past 150 years, and the Danube River were analysed as equal contributors to the area. The research shows that physical discontinuities from the past do not disrupt traditions or fundamental human-nature relationships, as intangible values connect physical remnants from different historical periods within this unique space.
