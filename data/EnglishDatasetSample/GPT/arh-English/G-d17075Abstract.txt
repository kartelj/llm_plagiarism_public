The primary goal of this study is to identify suitable models for the renovation of residential buildings in Serbia to enhance their energy efficiency. Previous studies have highlighted the importance of single-family homes and their poor energy performance. Single-family homes constructed between 1946-1970 are one of the most prevalent types, accounting for 35% of all single-family homes and 31% of all residential buildings. These homes are ideal for studying various energy efficiency improvement models due to their uniform characteristics. 

Properly defined models for improving building energy performance are crucial for planning renovation activities. However, the refurbishment models used in recent studies have been uniformly applied to all building types, without considering the unique characteristics of each type or group. This has led to the ineffectiveness of certain energy conservation measures for some housing types, highlighting the need for a more innovative approach to defining refurbishment models. 

The challenge of this study is to define and explore a comprehensive refurbishment model that includes energy conservation measures addressing the identified limitations and malfunctions in the buildings' layout and functional organization. These measures involve changes to the building's spatial structure and the introduction of passive design measures. 

The energy performance achieved through this comprehensive refurbishment model is compared with the existing energy performance of five typical single-family housing types built during the analyzed period, and with the energy performance resulting from two refurbishment models defined in recent research. 

Energy performance analyses are conducted using two methods: a calculation method defined by current legislation for assessing heating energy needs, and a thermal simulation of heating and cooling energy needs using Ecotect software. 

The study concludes that the energy performance achieved through the comprehensive refurbishment model is comparable to the results of an ambitious refurbishment scenario, with a significant increase in usable floor area, property value, and spatial comfort. Even in comprehensive refurbishment models that do not include an increase in volume and improvement of geometric characteristics, the same savings were achieved as in the ambitious scenario. 

The study also found that the dominant influence on heating energy needs lies in geometric characteristics, which further supports the comprehensive refurbishment scenario. The energy need for cooling in all investigated models was found to be almost negligible compared to the energy need for heating, which aligns with the characteristics of the investigated housing types. However, both its share and nominal values increase with the improvement of the thermal envelope and airtightness through refurbishment.
