The study of spatial concepts in architectural works is a key aspect of modern architectural theory and practice. This paper investigates these concepts in representative structures built for cultural purposes in the former Yugoslavia, providing a crucial foundation for understanding contemporary Serbian architecture in the early 21st century, as well as contributing to the study of 20th-century Serbian architecture. The research begins with the cultural politics of the new socialist Yugoslavia, which called for a unique architectural style that marked a distinct break from the modern architecture of the interwar period. 

The first section of the paper explores the complex process of defining this new Yugoslav architectural style through an in-depth analysis of theoretical texts by experts, competition designs for government and cultural buildings, and the cultural politics of the period under study. The architectural style of socialist Yugoslavia was theoretically established in the early 1960s, amidst the complex and shifting post-war socio-political landscape, and was ultimately positioned as a 'third way' between the dominant Western European modernist model and the Soviet socialist realism model.

The subsequent sections of the research critically examine the built cultural structures that embody this unique Yugoslav architectural style. The research shows that these structures fully embody contemporary spatial concepts for museums and memorial buildings. The unique aspects of Yugoslav architectural style derive from the fundamental concept of modernism, with the ideological addition of socialist society. The development, transformation, and mutation of spatial concepts in Yugoslav cultural structures were influenced by both the fundamental paradigms of the modern movement and the socio-political changes within the Yugoslav cultural space.
