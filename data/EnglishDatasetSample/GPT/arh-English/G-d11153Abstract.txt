The thesis delves into the transformation of Skopje's industrial urban space during the post-socialist era. It specifically examines the restructuring of industrial space, which includes the significant spatial reorganization of production activities due to deindustrialization and reindustrialization processes, the emergence of new specialized forms of production activities, and the new spatial distribution of industry. The research is based on the premise that the transformation process in Skopje mirrors that of Central and Eastern European cities, which was driven by economic restructuring, deindustrialization, globalization, and the shift towards a service-based economy. However, the unique aspects of Skopje's transition process, its economic development level, and its position in global economic flows create distinct differences in its transformation process. The primary research hypotheses focus on the transformation of socialist industrial space, characterized by a mix of continuity and change, and the location of new industrial activities resulting from the concentration and dispersion of production activities. The research examines the continuity and discontinuity in the development and distribution of industry and industrial areas in Skopje, the trends of concentration and dispersion of industrial activities, the emergence of new spatial forms of production and economic activities, and the change in the spatial pattern of industry distribution. The research suggests that the main outcomes of the industrial space transformation are abandoned industry locations (change) and the dispersed distribution of industrial activities beyond the city's urban boundaries, which significantly influence the new industry distribution. The research contributes in two ways. The first set of results confirms the correlation between space transformation and societal development in Skopje within the broader theoretical discourse of restructuring production space in socialist cities, with economic transition and changes in the political and social system. The second set of results highlights the potential and significance of existing and newly established industrial areas for Skopje's future spatial and economic development. The research suggests practical solutions in architectural design and urban planning based on theoretical and empirical knowledge of local issues, considering the historical, economic, and geopolitical context, as well as social and ecological issues. From an urban-architectural perspective, the future development of the city should prioritize renewal and construction within the existing urban context and complex ecological environment to achieve sustainable city development.
