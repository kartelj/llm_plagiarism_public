The doctoral thesis explores the intricate connection between public open spaces in inherited collective housing blocks constructed in the latter half of the 20th century and daily social life. It also examines the forms of social interaction that shape the usage patterns of these urban public spaces. The challenges in these urban neighborhood spaces are evident at both social and spatial levels, including population alienation, lack of communal activities, low vitality, inadequate maintenance, and decreased safety.

People and space are in a constant reciprocal relationship, with each influencing and shaping the other. Just as physical space reflects social processes and changes, human behavior is shaped by physical, social, and cultural contexts. The thesis posits that the spatial transformation of collective neighborhoods can be viewed through the lens of the transformation of socio-spatial relationships that underpin the usage patterns of neighborhood public open spaces.

The research was conducted using a blend of scientific methods and techniques from urban planning, architecture, and social sciences. The analysis of neighborhood spatial form determinants is based on a universally applicable typology rooted in spatial and sociological theories about the relationship between urban space and social processes.

The thesis includes a case study of the residential area of Novi Grad in Podgorica's inner city. The research on Novi Grad's public open spaces provides an analysis of a specific spatial social neighborhood model in relation to universal urban architectural paradigms, considering the social context of the period when Novi Grad was planned and built.

The research findings offer insights into the approach to urban space regeneration from the perspective of users and usage patterns in relation to spatial configuration. This could provide a scientifically grounded approach to public space design that could be beneficial to urban planners in the process of urban regeneration and redesign.
