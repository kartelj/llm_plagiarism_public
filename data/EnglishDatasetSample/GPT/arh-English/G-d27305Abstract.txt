The central question regarding the role of typo-morphology in Belgrade's new urban housing concepts is being examined through the identification of specific examples of constructed housing environments. The intricate nature of the topic necessitated the development of a unique, multi-tactical methodological platform, which combines typo-morphological and typological analysis with comparative-theoretical and comprehensive architectural-urban analysis. This methodological framework led to the establishment of defining evaluation criteria, which facilitated clear insight and separation, as well as further investigation of the earliest examples of modernized residential urban settlements. 

An analysis of Belgrade's collective housing from that period confirmed without a doubt that only the urban settlements of “Julino brdož (1966–1970) and Block 19a (1975–1982), both designed by the author team Lojanica, Cagić, Jovanović, met all eleven criteria inherent to the new housing concepts. These urban developments were subsequently used as case studies and were supplemented in the final part of the thesis with an analytical examination of three additional, relevant research and study projects. 

The main research focus was on examining the relationship between open public spaces and the residential buildings within the settlement. This revealed the motivations behind the creation of the overall residential structure, which was based on the dynamic potential of a hierarchy of graded external architectural spaces. This approach essentially re-examined the structural possibilities of the innovated urban matrix in the formation of denser, truly urban quarters. 

The effectiveness of these quarters was further enhanced by redefining the housing typology, which was achieved by poetically revealing the neglected memory capacities of housing in modern architecture, thereby creating a uniquely recognizable identity. This unique identity of the newly created place revealed itself as a result of ethically and progressively design-quality value-changed approaches. 

The dissertation broadly affirms the vital importance of scientific research methodologies in design, based on the consistency of theoretical considerations of the observed complexity of spatial challenges. The continuity of the author’s design interests and aspirations is crucial for the development of new concepts of urban housing.
