The doctoral dissertation's research topic falls under the design of folded plate structures. The construction of these structures has a strong correlation between form and structure due to the method of load distribution. Consequently, the system's geometry significantly influences the efficiency of the structure. This paper aims to understand and implement both architectural and structural requirements (static-dynamic analysis) that the structure must meet, as it serves both form and bearing functions. The multidisciplinary approach to the problem includes developing a software algorithm for structure generation, primitive designing, integrating the group supermatrices procedure into the finite element method, determining the macro finite element, and calculating the equivalent stiffness matrices of the flat plate, which is crucial for static-dynamic structure analysis. The benefits of a parametric folded plate generator and defining a simple equivalent macro finite element suitable for GPS analysis are demonstrated. The implementation of the procedure validates the innovation and enhancement of architectural-engineering design in complex structural systems.
