The business production complex "Trepca탑" is currently a focal point due to its halted operations and passivated system, a situation well-known throughout Kosovo and Metohia. The passivation of the technology and production complex of "Trepca탑" has led to regressive economic development and harmful environmental impacts across its entire territory. This situation has exacerbated social issues, particularly unemployment.

However, it is both possible and desirable to reactivate the "Trepca탑" business production complex. Prior to the socio-political crisis in 1989, the complex functioned as a cohesive system. The first step towards reactivation would be the regeneration of individual production complexes, followed by the revitalization of individual production units. 

The process of urban regeneration can be applied to both individual complexes and the entire "Trepca탑" business production. This can be achieved through a collaborative programming model and the brownfield locations model. For successful implementation, it is crucial to gather and coordinate all stakeholders at this time, from international, regional, national, and local-city levels. This is the primary objective of this research.
