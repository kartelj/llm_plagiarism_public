This paper explores the sociological and anthropological classifications of sociability forms, specifically focusing on the concept of the neighbourhood. In Serbian, the term used for neighbourhood is 'vicinity' (kom≈°iluk), and this study aims to delve into the subtle differences between these two terms. The paper posits that the neighbourhood is a concept of distance that resists the homogenizing influence of the idea of community. 

The neighbourhood is defined in various ways, including as a point of meeting based on shared identity, and as an open gathering or group form. This study investigates this openness, using examples from Belgrade neighbourhoods to measure the degree of fitting and dissociation of group form. 

The goal is not to delineate different theoretical approaches, but to explore the various uses of the term 'neighbourhood' in urban planning and to expand its meaning. The paper challenges the idea that the neighbourhood is a community, and instead suggests that it is a place of constant revisions and corrections of the idea of community. 

The paper also explores the philosophical and sociological questions of sociability, and the role of the neighbour in reflecting philosophical issues of otherness and understanding sociological issues of social cohesion. It raises questions about the basis of solidarity and interdependence, and classifies responses into three groups: compassion, conscience, and civic awareness. 

The paper emphasizes the importance of re-conceptualizing the idea of neighbourhood in cities that have had negative experiences with the idea of community. It suggests that the neighbourhood plan should include a minimal spacing between private and public space, and encourage neighbours to recognize their obligations to others. 

The paper also discusses the role of common space within the neighbourhood, and how it can help to bridge individual differences and link different lifestyles. This is based on an analysis of spatial concepts and a questionnaire designed to systematize community experiences of Belgrade residents. 

The paper concludes by advocating for a constructivist approach to transform existing residential complexes, based on the principles of responsible management of social capital. It suggests that any spatial intervention should take into account the underlying urban structure and the motive for amateur space adaptation. The paper also suggests that the use of common space could offer the possibility of new community in housing complexes currently in a state of atomization.
