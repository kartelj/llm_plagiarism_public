The significant societal changes over the past two centuries have led to developmental inconsistencies in regions like Eastern Serbia's mountainous areas, particularly in terms of spatial planning and environmental culture. This has sparked interest in researching the potential for revitalizing village centers and specific rural areas. The goal is to identify the right development code that balances existing natural and artificial resources with appropriate spatial interventions. 

This research aims to preserve traditional values and customs in rural communities by properly managing the impacts of modern urban, sociological, economic, demographic, and other societal phenomena. Eight rural settlements in Eastern Serbia were studied for this research, with one primary settlement undergoing a comprehensive analysis and the others serving as secondary models for comparison and result calculation. 

The primary model, a representative of both typical and unique settlements, was analyzed in the context of social, economic, and spatial circumstances. This analysis covered spatial changes across defined historical periods, from agrarian to craft-oriented, industrial, and the current transitional era. The architecture of centers, particularly apartment buildings and public facilities, was examined, as well as their role in forming high-quality tourism clusters. 

These clusters would leverage existing natural and human-made resources and potentials, as well as a new proposed hierarchical settlement network with new rural centers, independent of current administrative organization and irrational territorial affiliations. 

Like other regions, Eastern Serbia's mountainous area and its village centers have inactive action programs that could help overcome stagnation and crisis, and mitigate long-term depopulation and deagrarization. The theoretical framework for future development and spatial planning in these sensitive rural spaces will be developed based on the credibility of the initial hypotheses and the positively evaluated research objectives. 

Professional action, particularly in identifying and selecting central functional points in settlement networks, could lead to sustainable revitalization of deteriorated and depopulated settlements in Eastern Serbia's mountain regions. This would activate untapped natural and artificial resources in the areas surrounding the centers, based on organized programs, paving the way for modern and sustainable development of rural areas and their settlements.
