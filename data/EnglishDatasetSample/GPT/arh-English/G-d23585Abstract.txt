The doctoral thesis explores the correlation between social and shaping factors and the architecture of Pristina's public buildings from 1945 to 1990. The research aims to identify the various social and shaping factors that directly or indirectly influenced the design of these buildings. To fully comprehend the architectural spirit of this era, it's crucial to first understand its social spirit. The study focuses on understanding social relations, their evolution, and characteristics to scientifically establish their impact on Pristina's public architecture during this period. This involves a critical analysis of social conditions to determine their influence on post-WWII public architecture in Pristina. Iconic buildings that defined Pristina's image during this period were evaluated, organized, and compared to similar structures from the same era in other former Yugoslavian cities and beyond. The research utilized various scientific methods to determine the impact of post-war socialist social organization and ideology on Pristina's public architecture between 1945 and 1990. The cultural and architectural heritage was evaluated, confirming its influence on the architecture of the socialist city. Specific social factors that directly influenced the design of public buildings were identified, leading to a classification of buildings influenced by these factors. A methodological approach was developed for studying other types of buildings in Pristina during the same period. The modernity promoted by the new social order, which was in direct conflict with the traditional lifestyle of most Pristina residents, was a significant reason for rejecting modernism. The architecture developed during this period, while not fully covered in this research, represents an essential, yet largely unexplored architectural era in Pristina. This architecture, which varies in familiarity and clarity to different individuals, continues to be a significant part of the city's identity.
