This paper's primary argument is rooted in an examination of authenticity and integrity principles as they apply to the initial protection and presentation of Serbia's medieval fortified towns. A consistent approach could enhance the preservation of architectural heritage, serving as a genuine historical record (authenticity in design, form, substance, essence, management, function, tradition, and technique) and facilitating its significance's transmission to future generations. Compromising the preservation principles of authenticity and integrity in protecting and presenting architectural heritage can result in the loss of cultural monuments' monumental value and decrease the chances of their survival or inclusion in the World Heritage List. Consequently, it is crucial to refine the protection and presentation methodology of Serbia's medieval towns and fortresses with Exceptional Universal Value. This improvement necessitates better alignment of national laws with international guidelines and practices, the formulation of a successful strategy for each site to ensure its preservation for future generations (utilizing modern principles and methods in protection and presentation, which includes the use of new materials, technologies, and structures, fostering conditions for a unique cultural landscape development, preserving intangible heritage, etc.), while respecting the authenticity and integrity of cultural monuments.
