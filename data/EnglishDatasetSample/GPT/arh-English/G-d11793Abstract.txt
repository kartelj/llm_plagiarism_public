This doctoral thesis will explore the development of local models for architectural and technological adaptations in rural areas to address climate change. Once these models are established, they will be the focus of various theoretical debates. The terms 'architectural and technological interventions' will be examined and placed within the contexts of local, rural, and climate change. A significant portion of this study will investigate rural architecture and ruralism in the Republic of Serbia, specifically in the West Pomoravlje region. A feasibility study of the previously established local models will be carried out in the same region. The crux of this study is a comparative analysis of several local factors that are crucial for defining the local context and categorizing architectural and technological interventions. The research will explore the possibility of establishing a universal method for developing local models of architectural and technological interventions in the context of climate change.
