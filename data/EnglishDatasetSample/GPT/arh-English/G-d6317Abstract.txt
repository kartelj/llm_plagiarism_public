Urban/place marketing is a crucial activity for local governments in their development process, and it allows a city to showcase its unique character. One of the key tools in this process is communication, which is often facilitated through various design processes, including urban design. The city's physical environment, including pedestrian spaces, plays a significant role in this communication.

The city's image is not solely based on well-intentioned marketing or appealing commercial messages, but rather on the actual situation. This perspective allows for an analysis of the quality of the pedestrian space network, which can reveal the level of social responsibility of the local government. This, in turn, influences the attitudes of the audience/users and the city's image.

Pedestrian spaces are crucial in establishing and enhancing the city's competitive identity, making them a key area of application for research results in strategic decision-making and planning. This relationship was validated through case studies of pedestrian space networks in five European cities, identified as relevant representatives of different categories by ESPON. These case studies led to the creation of models and guidelines for improving the pedestrian space network in Belgrade's city center.
