The globalization process, driven by the revolution in information and technology and the reduction in transportation costs, has altered the role and status of cities. Cities, being smaller units, have shown more adaptability and flexibility in facing challenges related to globalization, which has propelled them to leading positions over weakened nations. National economic hubs have evolved into nodes for the flow of global capital, information, and people. The previous system of national states has been supplanted by a global network of cities. Cities have also become easily interchangeable and competitive with each other, which has become a prerequisite for development and economic growth. 

The leading global cities are those with the highest concentration of global capital, along with political and social power. They are at the top of global urban hierarchies. Other cities are ranked based on their position and significance in the global market. The period after the 1980s marked a transition from a Fordist to a post-Fordist economy. In the process of deindustrialization, the advanced services sector has taken the leading position in city economies. 

The criteria for determining a city's position in global urban hierarchies are mostly based on the concentration of international companies' headquarters engaged in financial services, accounting, marketing, insurance, law, and management. The post-Fordist economy has necessitated flexible business practices, openness to rapid changes, and adaptability to demands, all of which have brought innovation and creativity to the forefront. Success is only achieved through a creative process. 

The beginning of the 21st century was marked by the growth of the creative economy, its contribution to the overall global economy, its share in national and city incomes, and the political recognition of its importance for future growth. Industries based on knowledge, cognitive information processing, and individual and collective creativity were recognized by many urban governments as the most important for a city's future competitiveness and global position. 

Initial national and local policies based on the importance of creative industries were followed by a significant increase in the number of scientific works. Two of these stood out as the most popular. The first presented the thesis of the importance of a creative city, or in other words, the importance of a creative government and creative solutions to the challenges of globalization and post-Fordism. The second emphasized that the main resource of cities today is the creative class, and that cities should focus their efforts on improving their attractiveness to this group. 

The popularity of these concepts has resulted in their widespread use in urban policies and development strategies. However, it has also sparked a series of criticisms, ranging from criticizing unfounded opinions and a unilateral approach, to highlighting the lack of understanding of the context and time needed for the development of a creative city. Despite these criticisms, the initial concept was expanded and new theoretical approaches were developed. 

Among these, the concepts that stood out were those emphasizing the importance of the concentration of creative industries in specialized clusters, the existence of a creative milieu in the city, the connections between art and science, and the importance of social relations and business conditions for the concentration of the creative class. Despite differing views, there is a common understanding about the leading role of the creative industry and creative individuals and groups in the contemporary global economy. 

Creative industries and the creative class have become the leading elements of cities' global competitiveness in the 21st century. The type of social interactions characteristic of cities has always made cities attractive to creative individuals, so it is not surprising that the creative industry is concentrated in large cities. Leading global cities are also leading centers of creative industries. There is a clear correlation between a city's position in the global hierarchy of urban centers and, on one hand, the level of development of creative industries, and on the other hand, the concentration of the creative class in the city. 

In global trade, the share of creative goods and services is closely related to the positioning of the city. However, this correlation is not absolute, and the creative industry is not developing to the same extent in all cities, especially those lower in the hierarchy. Not all cities can or should be creative. The growing importance of creative industries is evident in the criteria of global urban hierarchies, where the focus has shifted towards the evaluation of conditions that encourage innovation and creativity, such as technical infrastructure, concentration of talent, number of patents, investments in research and development, quality of life, etc. 

To analyze the role of the creative city concept in enhancing a city's position in global urban hierarchies, a comparative analysis was conducted, examining three European cities that improved their positions from 1986 to 2012. These cities are Helsinki, Vienna, and Budapest, whose global competitiveness in the stated period was based on the creative city concept. It was concluded that the enhancement of these cities' positions in the hierarchy is a result of the development of the creative industry and class, induced both by targeted activities and spontaneous growth. 

The basic development principles that were applied were the formation of creative incubators and clusters, financial support for research and development, improvement of education, increasing the attractiveness of urban space and the quality of life in the city, with the aim of attracting the creative class. The conclusion is that cities were not focused only on the interpretation and implementation of one concept. Depending on distinctive local characteristics, trajectories of cities' development, and the spontaneous growth of creative industries, cities combined several different approaches â€“ the most suitable ones. 

Success came as a result of well-thought-out operations of city government, not from the mere application of measures proposed by popular authors, nor from the direct copying of good practices. The results obtained by the comparative analysis of the chosen cities have been examined through the case study of Belgrade. The analysis of Belgrade indicates a lack of application of the creative city concept in policies and strategies of urban development. This situation is partly a result of a deficiency of national strategies related to the creative economy. 

The concept has found its application in recent urban plans, but its implementation in urban projects and constructions is non-existent. On the other hand, it is evident that creative industries develop independently in Belgrade and that they form spontaneously specialized clusters in certain parts of the city. Belgrade has become globally recognized due to its creative industries and specific creative milieu. 

This doctoral dissertation defines a typology of approaches to the development of creative industries and class, which serves as a platform for the development of methods specific to Belgrade. The set of measures and approaches that best suits the local context, history, and already present trajectories of creative industries development has been selected. The measures aim to accelerate and support the city's further development, rather than to impose a new system. Only a tailored approach, with the application of innovative solutions, will result in improving Belgrade's global competitiveness and enhance its position in global hierarchies. 

There are two main contributions of this research. The scientific contribution is reflected in the enhancement of theoretical understanding of the role that the creative city concept has in positioning in global hierarchies of urban centers. In addition, research of methodological approaches to the development of creative industries and creative class improves knowledge about the application of the concepts into strategies, plans, and effects on the city's position improvement. 

The practical contribution of this research is related to the experience of three European cities in developing a creative city, as well as the experience of Belgrade. The analysis of international experience contributes to the understanding of the interrelationships between the national framework, local context, and the applied set of measures for the development of creative industries and class. Key practical contributions are providing an overview of the development of the creative economy in Belgrade, as well as redefining approaches to the improvement of its global competitiveness, by including the creative city concept.
