The dissolution of the Yugoslav concept and the downfall of the socialist societal structure in the late 20th century sparked a need for a review of past experiences in social relations and architectural heritage within the former Yugoslavia. This historical and political distance allows for a more objective and thorough understanding of the ideological underpinnings of the architecture of that era. This paper critically examines the social, political, and cultural events in Serbia that shaped new architectural and urbanistic practices in villages from 1946 to 1970. This period was chosen as it was marked by the implementation of significant acts that guided Yugoslavia's social and cultural evolution, primarily five-year plans. 

This research paper contributes to the study of Yugoslav architectural heritage and proposes a unique methodological approach to the analysis of rural architectural heritage. It uses several scientific methods, primarily the analysis of scientific and professional literature, to examine the relationship between architecture and politics and to generate new research questions about the development of rural settlements in Serbia. 

The paper assumes that the planning and construction of public buildings in villages played a crucial role in the cultural and political education of the rural population. The buildings discussed in the paper are educational and commercial facilities of general importance. Their architectural and stylistic features surpassed the existing traditional and cultural-historical values of architectural heritage, making them unique examples of socialist practice heritage in rural areas. 

The paper focuses on theoretical considerations in the field of architecture and ideology to provide a foundation for further research. Given the lack of theoretical studies on rural architecture and the fact that socialist architectural practice in Serbian villages has not been the focus of comprehensive multidisciplinary research, this paper aims to highlight the specific characteristics of planning and development during this period and the impact of this approach on the future development and organization of rural settlements in Serbia. 

The initial research phase provides a general overview of the development of specialist architecture, with a particular focus on Soviet and Yugoslav practice. The selection of a theoretical framework based on the relationship between architecture and ideology is justified by the fact that Yugoslav architecture was part of the broader cultural development of Yugoslav society and was seen as a means of embodying socialist ideas. 

The study of Soviet architecture is important for the correct interpretation of the ideological framework of Yugoslav practice. The cultural, economic, and political relationship between the Yugoslav political establishment and the Soviet Union influenced Yugoslav architecture and art, causing them to follow Soviet development trends until 1950. 

This paper emphasizes the significant role of the Association of Engineers and Technicians of Yugoslavia in objectively and critically examining the causal relationship between socialist ideology and architectural and urbanistic practice in rural areas. A review of architectural and urbanistic practice in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, with a special focus on rural heritage, is also included. 

The paper concludes by indicating the dual nature of post-war rural construction, with buildings serving as symbols of socialist culture as well as having a utilitarian role. Case studies on standard facilities such as cooperative buildings, village elementary schools, food industry facilities, and rural agricultural facilities, indicate a departure from traditional frameworks and the introduction of a new design approach. This new approach was characterized by the involvement of various professional organizations in the design process, the organization of mass work actions during construction, and the spread of agitprop culture.
