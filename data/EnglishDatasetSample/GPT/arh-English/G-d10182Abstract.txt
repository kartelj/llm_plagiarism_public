This research aims to examine the principles of structural design using ferrocement within an integrated approach to design and assess the results. The research question is: What principles should be applied to design structures using ferrocement to achieve ecological quality of buildings, in accordance with sustainable building development recommendations? The primary goal is to establish the theoretical foundation for the methodological concept of integrated structural design, with a specific focus on achieving ecological quality of buildings. 

The study hypothesizes that integrated structural design using ferrocement can achieve ecological quality of buildings, aligning with sustainable building development recommendations. This includes reducing negative environmental impact and resource consumption during construction, use, and dismantling of buildings, while improving quality of life, health, and safety in the built environment. 

The research begins by examining the concept of a building's ecological quality, using human ecology as a starting point. The ecological quality of a building is defined as the extent to which the building's performance meets user needs and expectations, providing social and economic benefits while protecting and improving the environment throughout the building's life-cycle. 

The research proposes indicators for assessing the ecological quality of buildings, classified into three sustainability criteria: environmental, social well-being, and economic well-being. These indicators serve as the foundation for establishing integrated project objectives, which guide the analysis of integrated structural design principles to achieve ecological quality of buildings. 

The research then explores the principles of building structure design in line with integrated project objectives. It defines integrated structural design as a systemic approach where the building structure is seen as a functional unit or sub-system, whose behavior is directed towards achieving ecological quality. 

The research also examines the principles of ferrocement design and structures based on its application, considering the ecological effects of using this composite material. The research concludes by testing and confirming the initial hypothesis, showing that integrated design of structural systems using ferrocement can achieve ecological quality of buildings, aligning with sustainable building development recommendations.
