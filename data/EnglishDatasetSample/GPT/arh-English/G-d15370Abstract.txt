The dissertation topic was selected based on the necessity to apply extensive urban planning experience and identified professional practice issues to theoretical research, with the goal of enhancing the planning system in Belgrade. The research was conducted in two crucial contexts: a local one, focusing on enhancing the role and efficiency of planning amidst constant change, crisis, and uncertainty, and a global one, examining urban phenomena, planning models of European and Global cities, and striving for sustainability while considering complex urbanization issues. The research period, from 1995 to 2015, is a significant part of Belgrade's transitional experience, during which the relationship between intense socio-political, economic, and technological changes and corresponding city planning policies can be observed. Despite significant changes in the environment, investor, government, and public dissatisfaction, and the need for adjustment, planning has shown considerable inertia since the late 1980s. Traditional, comprehensive planning methods and lengthy regulation processes have been criticized, and the need for a change in planning paradigm has been clear. Meanwhile, a global professional debate on Sustainable Development Goals and New Urban Agenda has begun, in anticipation of the UN Habitat III Conference 2016, and the role of planning in the new, predominantly urban era. The research includes a historical review of urban plans and strategies, providing a wider perspective than the proposed research period, in an attempt to analyze previous urban planning system patterns, as a basis for predicting potential changes in Belgrade's planning system, considering global experience and local tradition. Belgrade's dynamic environment can serve as a case study for the transition of post-socialist cities in the region, as well as for global cities facing perhaps different challenges within the same contemporary dynamics. The research supports the hypothesis that significant and intense urban changes necessitate a shift in Belgrade's planning paradigm, from conservative comprehensive planning to strategic, process-based planning, and from a purely public sector framework to balancing the needs and priorities of a wider range of urban stakeholders. Urban planning retains a significant role in the new planning framework, as a traditionally important and useful tool for urban management, albeit adapted for a changed, dynamic environment, new demands, and development goals. However, it is essential to incorporate other tools and instruments for implementing an urban strategy, beyond planning, and to involve stakeholders from various sectors in achieving diverse strategic goals, as these have not been the responsibility of urban planning so far. The experiences of selected, successful city strategies show that contemporary planning has become a tool for managing urban development more than ever, with a good plan, as a process, and a dedicated, consistent government authority managing urban change, being the guarantors of sustainable urban development in an unstable, constantly changing global environment.
