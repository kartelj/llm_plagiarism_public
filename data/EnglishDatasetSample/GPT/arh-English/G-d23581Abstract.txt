The research on energy efficiency is predominantly focused on residential buildings, despite attempts by the government and public to broaden this scope. There has been little significant progress in this area, particularly in Serbia where there is a lack of detailed analysis on the energy performance of sports buildings. This paper examines the energy efficiency of a significant group of sports buildings, specifically universal sports halls within sports centres, which are prevalent in Belgrade and Serbia. The primary research question is how much improvement is needed to enhance these facilities. The research aims to provide fundamental guidelines for improving thermal insulation materials and the use of passive features. This doctoral thesis investigates the potential strategies and techniques for achieving energy optimization during the refurbishment of universal sports halls, as well as conducting a theoretical and analytical audit of the quality of each implemented measure in accordance with existing rules and comfort conditions. The results of this research could be directly applied to the refurbishment of sports facilities with the goal of energy conservation through minimal interventions. The findings could be practically useful due to the realistic representation of the implemented measures. Computer simulations were used to demonstrate the behaviour of reference models. In addition to implementing individual and package measures, the research also explored the use of integrated sustainable energy systems through a specific methodology. The IES VE Integrated Environmental Solutions Virtual Environment software package was used to analyse the implementation of the aforementioned passive and active features.
