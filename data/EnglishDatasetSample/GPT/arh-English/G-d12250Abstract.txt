The research topic delves into the areas of architecture and lighting in open public spaces. The study is driven by the underexplored concept of open public space boundaries and their importance in the intricate urban dynamics of a city. Open public spaces, as catalysts of a city's public life, are not only social interaction hubs but also leisure spots for users, necessitating a comfortable environment. The role of lighting in a public space becomes evident in creating a pleasant and desirable atmosphere. Given the relevance of the topic, there is a need for ongoing enhancement of urban environments and highlighting the architectural merits of open public spaces, which are crucial in shaping a city's identity. The importance of a boundary for the space it encloses is seen through its structural impact on the ambiance of the space. The research aims to provide a clear understanding of the open public space boundary phenomenon and develop a suitable typology in relation to the city's complex urban context. The research process revealed that the boundary of an open public urban space can take various forms, as its perception is influenced by the observer's impression. Whether the boundary is made up of physical attributes or is perceived as a barrier due to established norms, it is recognized as a spatial phenomenon. Based on the findings of this analysis, criteria were set for the typological classification of urban boundaries in open public spaces. Three criteria emerged as significant for typological classification - flexibility, distinctiveness, and permeability of the boundary. From these criteria, twelve types of open public urban spaces were identified. This typology aids in understanding the relationship between the built space of the boundaries and the open public space, as well as the ancillary activities conducted within these spaces. The research concluded that the type of open public space does not dictate the type of boundary. As the meeting point for two different domains, a boundary reflects the characteristics of the spaces it links. The dual nature of the boundary and its flexibility in creating the desired perception of the ambiance of the open public space in a complex urban context were highlighted. The primary goal of the research is to underscore the significance of the open public space boundary in the lighting design process, recognizing the impact of lighting quality parameters on the appearance and perception of different boundary types. Another objective is to delineate the reciprocal influence of lighting within the open public space and its boundaries, and to define their respective relationships based on the type of boundary. Lighting in open public spaces is a crucial element in creating ambiance. How a public space appears at night is a key factor in creating an active urban space, hence the importance of lighting is seen in its ability to achieve the desired effects in a space to create a pleasant atmosphere. However, there is a lack of clearly defined guidelines for lighting design in the city's open public spaces. Current regulations focus on fulfilling functional aspects - facilitating traffic flow and ensuring user safety. Different types of open public spaces and their boundaries are treated uniformly, resulting in a disregard for the complexity of the urban context. The research involved analyzing lighting settings on a specific sample of different types of open public spaces, in relation to the types of boundaries that shape them. For each predefined type of open public space boundary, a representative sample was chosen for experimental study (both in the field and in the lab), as well as photometric calculation. The analysis of the interplay between space and boundary led to the identification of the impact of boundary types on lighting in open public urban spaces. The research results enable the development of a set of lighting quality parameters that influence the desired perception of boundaries by observers. Following the results, the interconnected influence of the attributes of the public open space boundary and the lighting quality parameters was presented. The research findings would contribute to the fundamental theory in the field of architecture by defining the open public space boundary phenomenon and demonstrating the impact of lighting on the perception of this boundary. In practice, this research would aid in understanding the impact of lighting quality parameters on the appearance of the boundary structure to achieve desired ambiances within the city's open public spaces. With the aim of enhancing the lighting design process, the research led to the development of a set of guidelines for lighting in open public spaces in relation to the characteristics of its boundaries.
