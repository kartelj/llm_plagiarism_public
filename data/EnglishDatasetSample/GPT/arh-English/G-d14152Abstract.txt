The research paper's strategy involves analyzing individual housing buildings to promote the construction of energy-efficient structures. This goal necessitated the examination of all crucial design aspects, including government regulations for building and reconstruction, the climate conditions of the specific area for construction strategy planning, the record of the existing housing fund, and the cultural identity expressed through traditional buildings. By analyzing a traditional building, a representative model of the existing housing fund, and a hypothetical model - a newly designed building - using energy performance analysis software, conclusions were drawn and practical guidelines provided for reconstructing existing buildings and constructing new ones based on scientifically tested evidence. The study concentrates on exploring and applying traditional architecture elements to enhance the energy performance of both new and existing buildings.
