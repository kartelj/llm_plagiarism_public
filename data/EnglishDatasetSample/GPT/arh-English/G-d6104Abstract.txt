This research focuses on the methodological concept of architectural critical practice, examining its theoretical postulation and historical context through the study of modern architecture in Yugoslavia. The primary goal is to explore Yugoslavian modern architecture within the theoretical framework of critical thinking and to elucidate its unique characteristics within the context of international modernist critical architecture. 

This research aims to contribute to the current theoretical debate on the role, forms, and scope of critical thinking in architecture by providing scientific insights into the possibilities and principles of establishing architectural critical discourse. The first part of this dissertation sets up the theoretical framework, explores key concepts of architectural theory and critical theory, and places the research subject within its geographical and historical context. 

The second part is a historical-interpretative research comprising four case studies, where previously postulated theses are examined under specific historical circumstances and theoretical models of architectural critical practice are constructed based on the research findings. 

The theoretical framework is established through the examination and systematization of key concepts such as critique, critical theory, critical architecture, practice, theoretical practice, and architectural critical practice. The hypotheses proposed in this glossary are further tested through a critical analysis of key texts from the fields of architectural theory, aesthetics, philosophy, and social theory. 

The concept of architectural critical practice is explained as a term broader than architectural criticism and critical architecture. The problems of critical discourse are viewed in the context of the current debate on the role of critical thinking in architecture. 

The research also explores the major problems of radical criticism, such as negativity, destruction, and inhibition, and raises the question of whether an effective solution can be found within the framework of criticism itself. 

The research concludes by examining the key examples of critical discourse of modern architecture in Yugoslavia through a historical analysis. The study shows that the theory of Manfredo Tafuri is not fully applicable to the Yugoslav cultural context and highlights the unique aspects of the Yugoslav critical discourse. 

The research also identifies four separate historical situations as precedents indicating the possibilities of transforming, extending, and opening up critical discourse in architecture. These include the early projects of architect Nikola Dobrović, the design and construction of the Yugoslav Journalists’ Association Center in Belgrade by architect Ernest Weissmann, the construction of the Museum of Revolution in Belgrade based on the designs of architect Vjenceslav Richter, and the work of architect Milan Zloković on the design and construction of the Tourist Settlement in Ulcinj. 

The research concludes that the concept of architectural critical practice is based on the principle of the double character of architecture and involves the invention, construction, and use of diverse critical instruments of architectural and urban design, as well as the critical methods of the history and theory of architecture. The study of the unique experience of Yugoslav modernism indicates further possibilities of opening up contemporary critical discourse in architecture.
