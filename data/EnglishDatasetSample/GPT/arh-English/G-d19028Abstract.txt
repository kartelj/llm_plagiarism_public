The concept of urban shrinkage has been around since cities were first established, but it has become more prevalent in recent decades, leading to its international recognition as a phenomenon. This is characterized by a decrease in population due to the challenges of restructuring an economy based on industry. The effects of urban shrinkage are evident in the form of vacant buildings and partially deserted city districts. The rapid growth of shrinking cities in Eastern Europe, particularly in East Germany since the start of the post-socialist transition in the early 1990s, has significantly influenced this concept. Despite its regional significance, the concept has not been acknowledged in Serbia's scientific and professional sectors. However, the 2011 Census revealed a population decrease in most Serbian cities for the first time, particularly in medium-sized, industry-dependent cities. This is supported by studies of six similar medium-sized cities in Vojvodina. The research focuses on housing, a topic that lacks international consensus regarding its role in urban shrinkage. While many scientists view it as a result of shrinkage, numerous instances suggest that housing shrinkage is more influenced by local factors. Therefore, this research aims to understand how the concept is locally and regionally adapted, demonstrating that housing plays a complex role in urban shrinkage that can affect urban redevelopment. To achieve this, a two-step analysis of selected cities was carried out based on international and regional principles of the concept. The ultimate goal of the research is to develop practical guidelines and recommendations for planning adaptations in Serbia's shrinking cities to counteract shrinkage patterns.
