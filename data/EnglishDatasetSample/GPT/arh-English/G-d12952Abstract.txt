The paper aims to conduct an architectural analysis of Roman Catholic churches constructed in Vojvodina between 1699 and 1939. This period of construction followed the revitalization of the southern Hungarian region after the Ottoman Empire's rule ended in the Habsburg Monarchy territories, post the Austro-Turkish wars and the signing of the Karlovci (1699) and Pozarevac (1718) Peace Treaties. The political and economic stability that lasted until World War I facilitated extensive construction activities. The construction of Roman Catholic religious buildings continued until the onset of World War II (1939). During these two and a half centuries, 231 Roman Catholic religious structures were erected in Vojvodina, including 3 cathedrals, 184 parish churches, and 44 covenant, family, or cemetery chapels across 166 towns and villages. 

The research focused on the spatial concepts, form-function correlation, architectural form origins and typology, Central European centers' influence, and the manifestation of cultural, socio-political, and religious climate in the architecture of these ecclesiastical buildings. The research's theoretical framework was the contemporary national cultural policy discourse and Christian theology, symbolism, and liturgical paradigm as architectural formation determinants of the liturgical space. 

The research involved a complex process, including extensive information analysis and photo and technical documentation of most studied objects' current situation. The research also involved sorting out representative buildings based on various value aspects. The research's final result was a typological systematization of the studied objects based on specific features of the spatial concept, other formal architectural characteristics, and a building's correlation with its immediate and wider environment. 

The research identified seven major typological groups, with key factors determining a type being plan development, use of constructions in interior design, architectural composition, and social climate and urban contextual factors. The research found that architectural language in interior and exterior design, determined by the dominant style in architecture, was not crucial for systematizing the architectural types. However, the dominance of certain styles in certain time periods determined not only the style and decoration application but also the internal space character. The research also found that a sacral building's correlation to the wider environment was significant in studying influence transmission and flow. The research confirmed the initial hypotheses through the applied Matrix method, which involved a systematic study of each researched object according to eight established criteria. The research on the spatial concept of Roman Catholic churches built in Vojvodina during the 18th, 19th, and early 20th centuries can identify the evolution of thought and the guiding principle of the spatial organization solutions and the dominant style in ecclesiastical architecture during the researched period.
