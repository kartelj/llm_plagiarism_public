This thesis explores the evolution and trajectory of urban and architectural paradigms, using as a case study the housing estates designed and/or constructed in Belgrade from 1965 to 1991. The time period of the study encompasses three significant historical events that influenced the theory and practice of socialist self-management in Yugoslavia: the 1965 economic reform, the implementation of the 1974 SFRY Constitution, and the dismantling of the socialist socio-symbolic order in the late 1980s. The study examines the paradigm shift in relation to these events, particularly focusing on the limited role of end-user participation.

The thesis is underpinned by the theories of French neo-Marxist philosopher Henri Lefebvre, who viewed the production of space as a social practice, and contemporary theories on the absence of societal closure. The hypothesis is that self-management, despite limited participation, was a key component of the urbanism and architecture of Belgrade's housing estates. The study also posits that the exclusion of end users from the design process was influenced by the competing interests of various stakeholders.

The research investigates the institutional mechanisms that governed the spatial production of Belgrade's housing estates for decades. It combines this investigation with an analysis of the actions of planners, architects, and end users. The thesis concludes that the shift in urban and architectural paradigms occurred across multiple levels of alienation, rendering any attempts to consistently adhere to the principles of socialist self-management ineffective.

The study finds that the urbanism and architecture of the period responded to societal divisions, resulting in a divergence from the conditions and dynamics of late modern and traditional Western paradigms. However, this divergence was not characterized by increased participation, but rather by its absence and disregard. The thesis concludes that despite the stark conflict between those who cynically undermined and those who faithfully followed the emancipatory principles of official discourses, both groups served as precursors to the new social order of post-socialist capitalism, a trait shared with traditional urbanism and postmodern architecture of the period.
