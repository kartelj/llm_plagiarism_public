This thesis utilizes symbolist theory as the methodological structure for both interpreting and perceiving architecture. The study interprets symbolic forms of creative expression as components for comprehending the significance of an architectural work within a social and professional setting. The first form of symbolic expression of architecture, referred to as transcendence, is examined outside the architectural work itself or outside architecture in general. This creative expression suggests certain symbolic values of architecture, whether at the level of symbolic form, symbolic spatial concept, motivation, or the idea of the architectural work. The second form is considered as immanent to both the discipline of architecture and the architectural work as a directly presented objectivity. In this context, architecture is viewed as a directly presented phenomenon, where the objectivity of physical representation and the subjectivity of its experience are interwoven. The thesis uses generalization at the theoretical level and case study methodology for specific research issue interpretation (specialization), applied to architectural realizations by architect Branislav MitroviÄ‡. The selected examples are analyzed and compared, and the works are interpreted in line with the theoretical structure of the study. This approach links the specific interpretation of an architectural work to the understanding of creative work based on symbolic functions. The resulting model for interpreting creative expression, solidly based on theoretical foundations, suggests two ways of approaching an architectural work: as possessing both transcendental and immanent attributes.
