This study delves into the modern urban recreation and its potential as a tool for urban development. The research aimed to investigate the potential of using recreation as a means of developing Serbian cities, given its integrative capacity as an urban activity. The current model of recreation development in Serbia does not consider its potential as a tool for urban development, hence the study seeks to redefine this concept to fit the Serbian context. The research was conducted on two levels. The first level involved examining the integrative role of recreation through urban theory and the fields of psychology, sociology, and geography of leisure. The integrative capacity of urban recreation was defined through concepts of leisure experience, encounter, and practice, and operationalized as a fluid, focal, and porous integrative practice. The study identified different ways to activate the integrative potential of urban recreation for autonomous and integrated forms of urban recreation. The study then explained the occurrence and spread of integrated recreation and explored its integrative capacity through a comparative analysis of eight development concepts through recreation. The goal was to identify the potential and limitations of each mode of urban development. The characteristics of each development concept were mapped onto a hypothetical model of a modern city to identify a new "landscape of integrated recreation". The findings showed that various development paths allowed recreation to serve as an integrative tool for urban development at different levels, in various forms, and in many city locations. These findings formed the basis for redefining the concept of recreation in Serbia and for developing a model for integrating urban structure through the development of recreational opportunities in urban space. This model links the process of producing recreational space, the characteristics of recreational spatial situations, and their potential integrative effects on urban structure. The new concept of integrated recreation was developed considering the specifics of Serbian cities and the unique social, economic, political, and cultural conditions in which they develop. The implementation of the integrated recreation concept was explored using Belgrade as a case study. The analysis of four main planning documents and strategies for city development showed that the basis for using recreation as a tool for urban development exists, but there are many restrictions for implementation. However, it was shown that various forms of integrated recreation can be identified in practice, but they are not connected with the official planning system. Finally, the analysis of the role that integrated recreation played in the redevelopment of Belgrade's central waterfront on the Sava river showed that recreation can be used as a tool for urban development in Serbian cities through spatial fragments and as an urban tactic.
