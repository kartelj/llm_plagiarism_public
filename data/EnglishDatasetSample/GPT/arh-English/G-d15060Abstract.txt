The doctoral thesis focuses on creating a suitable model for predicting ionospheric corrections with adequate precision for real-time kinematic (RTK) applications. The initial step involved studying short-term ionospheric characteristics at a regional spatial level to understand its behavior during various seasonal and daily periods. Data from permanent network stations across Serbia were utilized for this purpose. The study analyzed four different seasonal periods during the last solar maximum in 2013 and 2014. Subsequently, the changes in electron content in the D region due to solar X-flares were examined, leading to an investigation of the temporal changes in Total D Electron Content (TEC) in the D region and their contribution to the total TEC, i.e., the total delay of GPS signals. The final product is a suitable model for predicting ionospheric corrections for RTK applications in Serbia. Two predictive methods, linear regression and neuron networks, were evaluated. The neuron networks method proved superior, predicting ionospheric delay with an accuracy of Â±5 cm on average in 9 minutes relative to the actual rate of ionospheric changes. This suggests that neuron networks can be used to predict ionospheric delay errors in RTK systems, enabling centimeter-level positioning.
