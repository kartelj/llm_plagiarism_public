The paper's initial objective is to investigate the natural, historical, and cultural factors that influenced the emergence and evolution of Serbian spa architecture from 1830 to 1940. The findings pave the way for understanding the interplay and impact of historical, social, and cultural conditions, as well as the country's modernisation processes, on this architectural style. A look into its evolution and construction reveals the roles of the government, its agencies, organised stakeholder groups, and private clients, as well as the influence of specific architects on the design features of spa complexes and buildings. 

Spa, climatic, and health resorts are communities that sprang up in areas with unique natural features and well-planned facilities. In the 1830s, following comprehensive research into natural resources, the government began to establish a legal framework for the development, construction, and enhancement of spas, enforcing its regulations and implementing key architectural development guidelines. 

During the 19th and early 20th centuries, civil servants from the Ministry of Building, who were prominent and skilled builders and architects of various generations, expressed their unique styles and artistic forms. Field investigations revealed the works of lesser-known architects, as well as unknown works of renowned ones. Private clients' and doctors' requirements also significantly influenced style trends in spa architecture, making them a research subject. 

The study also determined how architectural elements from Central European spas were introduced to Serbia during Europeanisation and modernisation, accompanied by rapid industrialisation, urbanisation, and traffic development. This brought new social norms and civil conduct models. 

Given that Serbian spa architecture has not been extensively and thoroughly researched, this paper provides a well-researched interpretation of its origins and evolution, highlighting key buildings and values to aid in understanding its significance in the architecture of the period under study. 

The investigations, research, evaluation, and historiographic analysis in architecture form the basis for establishing guidelines for the future development and use of spa architecture, considering cultural and natural heritage preservation and sustainable development. This paper aims to inspire other academic fields to establish development directions and activities for better utilisation of spa natural resources and architectural features as an economic potential.
