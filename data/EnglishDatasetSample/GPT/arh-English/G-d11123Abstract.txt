The study of Belgrade's residential buildings' features is essential for a thorough evaluation of the domestic housing stock's condition, its strengths and weaknesses, and for determining our current situation and future actions. This dissertation aims to investigate the construction of Belgrade's residential buildings and evaluate them in terms of living comfort. The research focused on all material aspects of a building structure (construction, building envelope elements, partition elements, and finalization) and their role in meeting comfort requirements. 

Given that Belgrade's housing stock spans 150 years, typical time periods were identified based on relevant building achievements. This method aimed to organize a vast amount of professional material and typologically position a representative sample. During the observed period, typical structures were identified and organized, building characteristics were noted, and building regulations were examined, forming the basis for creating representative models and their structure. 

These models were then analyzed for living comfort quality, including thermal, acoustic, and visual comfort, as well as indoor air quality. The next research phase involves defining each comfort's relevant parameters and developing a methodology for testing the established housing construction models. 

Each comfort aspect is a unique specialization or profession, leading to various methodological procedures and multidisciplinary research. The parameters were selected to provide measurable results for each requirement category, allowing for an objective evaluation. 

Using specialized computer tools for each comfort category (thermal, sound, and light), representative models were examined and results were obtained, leading to conclusions about the quality of residential buildings in Belgrade. The results were organized by comfort categories and then summarized by individual models, allowing for a comprehensive review of each sample's characteristics, a synthesized evaluation, and conclusions based on the established chronological units.
