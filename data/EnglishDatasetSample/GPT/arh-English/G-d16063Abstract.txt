This study will explore the conditions and relationships that make up architectural comfort, transitioning from the material to the experiential, or from the theoretical to the practical aspects of architectural structure. The aim is to incorporate redefined and restructured knowledge about comfort into the field of architecture. The reorganization of existing knowledge about comfort includes not only basic physical comforts, but also a range of complex architectural comforts, shaped by spatial and formal, existential and emotional, social and communicative, and cultural-signifying criteria. 

Architectural comforts, both qualitative (formal, functional, sensory, emotional, domestic, kinesthetic, communicative, proxemic, mnemonic, and creative) and quantitative physical comforts (thermal, acoustic, sound, and visual), form the structure of overall comfort. The practical part of the research focuses on early childhood environments and involves establishing parameters, spatial indicators, and architectural vocabulary that can evaluate space through social interaction and cultural transmission, and in relation to the intensity and character of observed and experiential relationships between children and their environment. 

An observational study of two nursery units shows that space is a crucial cognitive factor, and its quality depends more on the level of complex architectural comforts than on quantitative physical factors. The universality of architectural formation, as a methodological tool, is evident in its applicability at different structural levels and scales, both for evaluating existing spaces and designing new ones. Architectural comfort could be a key method for balancing material and cognitive, spiritual and instrumental, poetic and scientific, theoretical and practical elements in line with architecture's natural position at the center of the quantitative-qualitative dichotomy.
