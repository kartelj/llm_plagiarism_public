Over the past two decades, the redefinition of architecture and urban planning in the context of sustainable development has led to the perception of the building fund as a man-made resource, a legacy for future generations. Viewing buildings as a resource raises numerous questions about their rational use: how to utilize them, adapt them to modern needs, and prolong their lifespan. Housing constitutes a significant portion of the building fund, so adapting this sector has enormous potential for enhancing not only individual dwelling units but also our overall built environment. Energy performance is a crucial factor in the ecological assessment of buildings, which is why this study focused on enhancing the energy efficiency of multifamily housing. After a comprehensive analysis of the Serbian building fund, the housing stock built between 1960 and 1990 was identified as the most productive period, characterized by an unparalleled diversity in architectural styles and construction technologies that have largely disappeared from recent building practices. To offer a broader range of individual improvement measures than those presented in the National Typology of Residential Buildings in Serbia, a critical analysis of key thermal envelope elements was conducted. Instances where generic, model improvements could be implemented were identified, and alternative solutions were proposed and analyzed for specific cases. The research resulted in a method that facilitates the decision-making process for determining the most effective measures to improve a building's energy performance. This method was tested on five different apartment buildings to evaluate its effectiveness and explore various results. Lastly, the potential for enhancing and expanding the proposed method was analyzed, and areas of research were identified where operational, dimensional, and programmatic improvements to the methodology could be applied.
