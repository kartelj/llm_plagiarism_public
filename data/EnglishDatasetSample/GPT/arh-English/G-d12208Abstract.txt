The swift and intricate shifts in all areas of modern society create a fluid environment that shapes contemporary architecture, giving it characteristics of a multidisciplinary practice that is constantly evolving. Adapting to these changes leads to not only a dynamic redefinition of the architect's role but also a redefinition of the design paradigm itself, by reevaluating and establishing new design principles. The goal is to place a specific transformation principle within the architectural discourse through systematization and classification, highlighting its evolving path, impact, and significance in the advancement of both society and architectural theory and practice, from various Avant-garde movements in the 20th century to the development of the digital paradigm. Further exploration of the transformation principles in architectural discourse defines the aspects of applying these principles for the purpose of adapting buildings to the dynamic changes in context and user needs. In light of this, transformation, with all its complexities, can be categorized into several principles: mobility, ephemerality, modularity, prefabrication, perceptive transformation, universality, open plan, interaction, and improvisation. This PhD thesis examines the location, nature, and relationships among these principles through the analysis of several architecturally significant examples, investigating the influence and application of transformation principles in the development of design models. The research references Pritzker prize laureates since 2000, with special focus on those who incorporate transformation principles in their theoretical work. The level of affirmation of transformation principles in the analyzed projects shows their growing importance as living standards change, thus becoming integrated with the methodological tools in the process of contemporary architectural design. The analysis suggests that a contemporary approach to architectural design requires a flexible design model that includes a transformation principle. It is specifically suggested that the compatibility of certain principles, which serves as a conceptual framework for defining specific design models, arises from the influence of transformation principles. Defining contemporary design models in terms of transformation principles does not represent a completely predetermined approach in architectural design. This research emphasizes the contribution to establishing a platform that encourages further research and broadens the possibilities for creative activity in architectural design. In this regard, the classification of contemporary design models represents a flexible approach that aids in clarifying the nature of dynamic architectural concepts.
