This work begins by exploring the elusive nature of the ambivalent position, which constantly oscillates between belonging and not belonging, and is often overlooked in existing conceptions. The aim is to uncover the potential for a multi-layered reality. Fragmentation is presented as a method for understanding reality and assessing the ambiguity and incompleteness of architecture in a post-digital world and culture.

By disrupting reality through the virtual, the visual world transforms into a collection of independent images, creating a visual experience within its own fragments. This places the concepts of incompleteness and insufficiency on an equal footing, as elusive entities that defy precise definition, leaving us continually searching for what might be possible. Consequently, they maintain an ambivalent relationship with their totality and the inability to achieve it.

This implies that the conceptualization of fragmented forms takes place virtually, representing their own outline through digital code, thereby making variability and unpredictability a design challenge, a task, and a problem. The dual nature of all things prompts the question of surpassing one's own reality, focusing on the process itself and the creation of new conditions. Being perpetually in-between, insufficiency paradoxically becomes its own objective, achievable only if the focus is shifted to the process of creation or its inherent unattainability.
