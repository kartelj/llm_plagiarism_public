This study examines the process of establishing methodological principles for the revitalization of disused railway corridors in the Republic of Srpska and their potential uses. These abandoned industrial railway corridors are a unique type of brownfield site, necessitating a distinct approach to urban renewal. The primary aim of this study is to identify the most suitable method for the urban renewal of such areas. 

The phenomenon of brownfield sites and various urban renewal methods were investigated through literature review and critical content analysis, with the goal of finding the most suitable method for urban regeneration of these sites. The study found that many authors have researched the urban regeneration method, which includes the brownfield renewal process and can positively impact ecological, economic, and social aspects of life. Therefore, the urban regeneration method, which preserves the identity of a location while offering acceptable renewal concepts, is deemed the most suitable for such areas, confirming the first research hypothesis.

The second part of the study involves epistemic and phronetic organizational research aimed at defining methodological principles for the regeneration of abandoned railway corridors, the second research goal. Architectural and urbanism research explores science, research objects, and their contexts, and is more effective when methodologies combine 'pure knowledge' (episteme) and 'practical wisdom' (phronesis). Epistemic organizational research analyzes the theoretical background and current scientific knowledge within the sustainability concept (environmental, economic, and social), and the epistemic methodological principles for regenerating abandoned railway corridors were defined based on chosen theories' strategies. Phronetic organizational research, based on individual descriptions of successful case studies and their comparative analysis, was used to define the phronetic methodological principles for regenerating abandoned railway corridors. A comparative analysis of the epistemic and phronetic methodological regeneration principles showed that combining episteme and phronesis contributes to a broader set of methodological principles for regenerating abandoned railway corridors, confirming the second hypothesis.

The third part of the research involves applied research examining the usability and validity of the methodological principles for regenerating abandoned railway corridors in the Republic of Srpska, the third research goal. The current situation in the Republic of Srpska regarding the identification, mapping, status, and renewal of brownfield locations was first explained, with a particular focus on abandoned railway corridors. This was followed by field research conducted on six industrial polygons in three cities/municipalities in the Republic of Srpska (Banja Luka, Prijedor, and Novi Grad). The industrial railway corridors were mapped, and the usability and validity of the methodological principles for regenerating abandoned railway corridors were tested, and renewal guidelines for these areas were defined. This suggests that the defined principles can serve as reference recommendations for planning the renewal of abandoned railway corridors, confirming the third hypothesis.

This research has both scientific and practical implications as it explores a contemporary subject. The scientific impact refers to the synthesis of relevant knowledge within the subject area, its modification by new scientific information, and the development of a theoretical and methodological approach for formulating principles for regenerating abandoned railway corridors. The practical impact refers to the potential application of the regeneration principles to specific polygons of abandoned railway corridors to find realistic renewal solutions and adequately consider the problems and potentials of the abandoned railway corridors in urban and architectural planning and design. 

In conclusion, this research lays the groundwork for further studies aimed at creating strategies, concepts, and regulations for regenerating abandoned railway corridors in the Republic of Srpska, as there is a need for new renewal regulations for such locations in this territory. The methodological principles for regenerating abandoned railway corridors defined in this research could serve as the basis for defining new legislative documents. Aligning urban planning documentation with the methodological principles for regenerating abandoned railway corridors could yield the best results in practice. This research can also serve as a foundation for planning, designing, and implementing green corridors, a crucial concept in contemporary architectural and urban practice.
