The proposed research aims to explore the typological aspects of architectural production, considering the potential for new models and techniques that incorporate typological analysis as a flexible part of the design process, rather than a rigid classification system. The study begins with a critical review of architectural typologies and their role in design. It then delves into relevant philosophical concepts that can be integrated into architectural discourse to foster new methodological approaches to design. The research hypothesis is tested through a design research method, which creates a cyclical link between analytical and intuitive actions in the architectural process. 

Historically, generic architecture has been driven by mass production needs within a social context (as seen in Ford's Model). However, in the contemporary world, activities can often be carried out independently of physical space characteristics. This raises questions about the role of architectural types in the context of individual cultural production, as opposed to consumerism. 

The research questions whether the physical response to our fluid, elusive modern society is, in fact, an ambivalent, generic spatial type. It explores the relationship between the fluidity and specificity of modern society and the generality of serial space. The study posits that such a typological form (a generic type) is appropriate for an era where technology, such as 3D printers, allows for the transformation of mass production into individual production. 

The generic, serial architectural type, through typological ambivalence, enables the personalization of space. The concepts of typological ambivalence and the generic framework of architectural design, along with their interrelationships and mutual dependencies, will be conceptualized throughout this research.
