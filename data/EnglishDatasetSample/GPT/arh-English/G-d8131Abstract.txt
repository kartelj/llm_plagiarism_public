The study focuses on developing a model for categorizing building elements and associated site work in design documentation. The design and construction process necessitates the generation and gathering of diverse information at each phase of the building's life cycle. This process requires a well-defined format for consistent information transmission across different stages. The evolution of construction and trends in advanced global systems suggest the need for greater focus on pre-construction processes, including detailed planning and coordination of design and construction documentation. This leads to key objectives like quality enhancement, time reduction, and construction cost control. 

Processing design documentation is crucial in the contract process for building construction, ensuring compliance with both national and international standards. It also facilitates easier management of the construction process and provides quicker, more accurate construction cost estimates in the early investment cycle stages. 

An analysis of local and global practices has highlighted a research area: the absence of a clearly defined, scientifically-based nomenclature and classification system that would standardize design documentation development, thereby improving relations and processes throughout the building's life cycle. 

Structured and standardized design documentation serves as a common link for data transmission, descriptions, monitoring, and evaluation information across all project phases. The research has led to the establishment of specific criteria for forming a standardized classification model based on building elements according to the building's location and function. 

The model's aim is to facilitate clear communication among building process participants regarding workload and costs at each life cycle stage. A classification model based on building elements becomes a constant in the dynamic process of design and construction documentation. Simultaneously, the model allows for flexibility in the ongoing development of building technology and material application. The model remains unaffected by inevitable economic and technological changes, placing the building in a logical, central role in the construction process.
