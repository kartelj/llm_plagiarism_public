The doctoral dissertation research primarily aims to assess the ecological suitability of houses in Bosnia and Herzegovina, specifically focusing on the role of wood usage. Scientific studies have established a direct link between the manner and extent of wood usage and the ecological suitability of houses. 

An algorithm was developed to facilitate this evaluation. The process began with the selection of a reference housing type and its variants for assessment. The typical family house in Bosnia and Herzegovina was chosen as the main reference type. Based on this, three additional variant reference types were created for assessment. The reference type T is a typical family house built using traditional mass building techniques, while the reference type T is an ecologically advanced version with more extensive use of wood. The variant reference types T and T are constructed using wooden structural elements. T represents a building with Easy Panel elements used for walls and interfloor constructions, while T refers to a building with movable CLT panel elements.

The assessment involved evaluating specific elements and the entire building using the eco2soft software, as there are no existing models or tools for this process in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The evaluation was conducted in two stages: first, the building's thermal layer was assessed (phase BG0), followed by the entire building (phase BG3). The evaluation defined the life cycle phase of a house, from "cradle to gate" for phase BG0, and included maintenance impacts for phase BG3. The maintenance impacts were evaluated over a 100-year period, with additional assessments at 25, 50, and 75 years to thoroughly evaluate the impacts during the maintenance of house elements and their relationship to the building materials used.

The evaluation process demonstrated that using wood can enhance the ecological suitability of houses, especially family homes. This improvement means that houses have a lesser negative impact on the environment and occupants, whether from production or usage. Assessing the impact of wood usage on the ecological suitability of houses could significantly influence the volume and manner of wood usage, thereby contributing to economic development.
