The thesis research is centered on the potential of repurposing pre-World War II industrial buildings in Belgrade into office spaces. Current studies provide limited data on the most suitable type of industrial buildings for such conversions. Furthermore, Serbia is yet to establish building preservation practices, including energy optimization. The primary research hypothesis suggests that by enhancing the fabric and interior of existing industrial buildings, it's feasible to create comfortable internal environments with low energy consumption. The chosen methodology and assessment criteria can determine the most suitable industrial buildings for office conversion. Moreover, through analysis, the most effective energy optimization measures can be identified to create comfortable internal conditions and comply with current regulations for the new function. Office building energy and comfort requirements have been determined through functional requirement analysis and a comprehensive review of current regulations and building certification system criteria. Based on these requirements, the adaptation potential of industrial buildings has been identified. The thesis evaluates the potential of different industrial typologies to be repurposed as energy-efficient offices through London case studies. Belgrade's industrial heritage has been categorized based on its original industry type and potential suitability for office conversion. Two reference models, representative of Belgrade's industrial heritage, have been selected for further analysis. The impact of individual envelope-improvement strategies, natural ventilation, and artificial lighting reduction due to daylight availability have been assessed through computer simulations. The analysis also covered the integration of renewable energy systems and their potential impact on the building's total energy demand. Thermal analyses were conducted using IES-VE software, daylighting simulations with DIVA for Rhino, and renewable energy simulations with RETScreen software. The thesis provides recommendations for achieving energy optimization in accordance with current regulations and improvements exceeding current standards to maximize CO2 reduction. The initial hypotheses have been validated and the research objectives achieved through the prescribed methodology. Specifically, the research established reference models for converting pre-World War II industrial buildings in Belgrade into energy-efficient offices. The research contributions include identifying and systematizing the characteristics of existing industrial buildings relevant for conversion into energy-efficient offices, and providing recommendations for achieving energy optimization in the adaptation and conservation processes of industrial buildings.
