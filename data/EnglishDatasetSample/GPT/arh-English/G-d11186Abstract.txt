The study examined the characteristics of individual straw bales, both plastered and unplastered, as well as walls made from these materials. It also explored the use of straw bales in the construction of load-bearing walls for single-storey buildings. The experiment conducted in this study determined the modulus of elasticity for unplastered straw bales to be 400 kPa, and 1580 kPa for plastered ones. The density of the straw bales was found to be 1.18 kN/m3. Creep-tests were performed, and the behavior models, initial compression, and creep values were identified. In the fire test, a wall plastered on only one side showed no visible damage or structural changes after being exposed for two hours. The study also referenced existing literature on noise and thermal protection levels. An economic analysis highlighted the significant cost benefits of building with straw bales. The study concluded that, based on both experimental and theoretical analysis, straw bales satisfy all necessary criteria for use in load-bearing structures.
