The potential for architecture to operate autonomously is explored within the context of studying the unique aspects of architectural competition practice. The focus of this research is the competition practice in Serbia, situated within the Yugoslav cultural sphere. The research aims to critically and scientifically investigate the constraints and opportunities for the architectural discipline, practice, and work to function independently and critically within the broader cultural, economic, and social contexts. Another objective is to utilize the scientific findings to clarify the position and role of architectural competition practice in constructing and demonstrating architecture's disciplinary autonomy. The research problem is outlined in the first chapter, which explores potential expressions of architectural autonomy in competition practice. The workings of the architectural competition institution are detailed, and standard interactions between key players are scrutinized, including communication methods, the role of competition drawings, architectural design as a medium, the establishment of value premises, and other elements. To elucidate the unique aspects of competition practice in Serbia, including its various stages and forms, the paper offers a glimpse into the evolution of the local architectural scene – the education of architects, the activities of professional associations, the enactment of relevant laws and regulations. The paper also reviews the most significant competitions during the period under study. The second part of the paper presents case studies from several architectural competitions for three locations in Belgrade – Terazije Terrace, Republic Square, and Slavija Square, conducted between the 1920s and 1990s. After analyzing individual architectural solutions and conducting a comparative analysis of a series of projects and concepts, along with an analysis of the textual content of primary sources, conclusions are drawn regarding the realities of individual competitions and the overall state of the architectural scene in relation to the question of architectural autonomy.
