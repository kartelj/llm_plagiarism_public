For approximately the past fifteen years, planning theory and practice have been marked by a quest for a planning system that can identify and respond to the desires of citizens, while protecting and promoting shared values. This approach to planning is not new and shares similarities with the concepts of representative or lawyer's planning, established in the 1960s. Despite the popular belief in the need to involve a wide range of participants in the planning process, the concept is now well-defined and theoretically grounded, with a comprehensive and sophisticated system of checks and balances in place. This has led to the emergence of a new communicative-collaborative paradigm. Terms associated with various types of citizen-centric planning include 'bottom-up' planning, 'grassroots' planning, 'participative' planning, and 'community' planning. 

The study investigates the concept of planning that views citizen participation as not just desirable, but essential for effective planning and development governance. It seeks to answer questions about the nature of efficient and effective participation, who should participate and how, the role of information and communication technology (ICT), and the feasibility of implementing a modern concept of citizen participation/planning to potentially enhance urban planning in Serbia. 

The research is carried out on two levels: (1) The level of general conceptual orientations and their development, based on a review of relevant theoretical work and global experiences in this field, and (2) The level of urban planning in Serbia, where these general conceptual orientations are tested and adapted to define an appropriate planning model for the area under investigation. 

The study identifies opportunities and outlines the methods and conditions necessary for implementing a modern concept of citizen participation in urban planning in Serbia, based on a review of various theoretical perspectives, concepts, and planning practices.
