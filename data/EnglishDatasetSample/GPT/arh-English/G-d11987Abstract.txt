The thesis suggests a novel approach to designing surface structural systems, combining geometric modeling techniques with computational simulations of structural behavior. This proposed method takes the form of a morphogenetic strategy, utilizing structural analysis potentials during the initial design phase. The method is both interactive and adaptable, essential for the unique design process of surface structures. The algorithm, which simplifies and streamlines the design of surface structural systems, was achieved through the use of Isogeometric analysis. This numerical procedure represents the structure's geometry and kinematics using the same functions, unlike traditional Finite element analysis which relies on geometry interpolation. The isogeometric concept involves analysis based on the precise initial geometry, defined by NURBS technology. This allows for the design, analysis, and modification of the model using a single data type. From a theoretical and conceptual standpoint, a unique algorithm was developed and incorporated into a CAD system that uses NURBS geometric representation. This code allows for the automatic generation of forms that are structurally optimal. The implementation of this method showcases the effectiveness of the proposed approach and affirms that the enhancement of creative tools promotes innovation and optimization in the design process.
