The concept of relativistic geometry is employed to juxtapose the inversion as a quadratic transformation on a plane with its spatial representation in the form of two stereographic projections: from a plane to a sphere and back to the same plane (from the antipodal centre of projection). Both traditional and relativistic interpretations are discussed. Various forms of conic symmetry, both conformal (axial and point symmetry) and non-conformal, are examined. Harmonic symmetry, a fully bijective and conformal central inversion, is utilized to demonstrate the transformation of all kinds of conic pencils and their unique characteristics into the pencils of 3rd and 4th order curves and their corresponding unique characteristics, and vice versa. The primary transformation is inversion, which is understood in two ways: as a quadratic transformation in traditional projective geometry and as pure symmetry in relativistic geometry, with a constant comparison of the two geometric systems and their potential for explanations and expansions. A 4th order curve pencil obtained by inverting a quadric pencil cut by a plane into an equivalent 4th order surface pencil cut by the same plane is also discussed. The identification of the equivalence of inversion with traditional axial symmetry (non-conformal symmetry) has opened up numerous possibilities for mapping curves and surfaces and creating new forms that can be highly beneficial in both geometric theory and architectural practice. Research into expanded symmetry will significantly broaden the potential for further discoveries about plane and surface forms. The projection model was utilized to develop the Lisp routine, and AutoCAD software was used for computer drawing of the conic pencils, 3rd and 4th order curve pencils, and for generating and presenting the spatial models of the surfaces.
