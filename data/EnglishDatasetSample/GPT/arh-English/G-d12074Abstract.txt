The Belgrade Fortress is a complex and layered historical site with preserved remnants from various historical periods, demonstrating its long-standing development. It evolved from an ancient Roman military camp to a Byzantine castle, a medieval fortified town, and finally a modern fortified bastion. The fortress was modified according to the needs of each era, reflecting its significant geostrategic position. Its many transformations were influenced by historical, social, and political circumstances. Despite changes in rulers and historical contexts, the fortress maintained its defensive purpose and importance, whether it housed an urban structure or military fortifications. 

The fortress's liberation from Turkish rule in 1867 marked the beginning of its transformation from a military stronghold to a public city space. This transformation occurred in two stages: the gradual handover of fortress areas from the military to the city, and a period of formal protection and revitalization. Despite being the historical heart of urban Belgrade, the fortress is not currently utilized to its full potential. It is not fully integrated into the city space, either functionally or purposefully, despite its significant position and value. 

To understand this situation, evaluations were conducted of the historical structures and the changes that occurred during the fortress's transformation into a city space. Studies were also carried out on the extent to which ideas, plans, and conservation principles were implemented during the fortress's transformation into a public space and during the period of formal architectural heritage protection. 

Redefining the importance and re-evaluating the Belgrade Fortress was a necessary step towards establishing a conservation approach that would better integrate the fortress with the city. This involved analyzing the potential and limitations of existing connections and the roads obstructing the fortress-city direction. A new conservation approach was tested against modern theoretical foundations established in international charters and recommendations. This led to the definition of a new methodological process that could be applied in architectural heritage protection practice and legislation.
