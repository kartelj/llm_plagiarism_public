The study will suggest an innovative approach to designing NURBS spatial structures, incorporating fabrication methods for physical models Rapid Prototyping and 3D optical strain measurement techniques. This streamlined procedure would simplify and enhance the design process for unconventional NURBS structures. Rapid Prototyping, a continually evolving technology, is underutilized in architectural form design. The models created in this study will be used for structural analysis. Assessing structural behavior in terms of strain and stress is a crucial validation step for computer analysis results using the finite element method, especially for unconventional solutions. This step logically precedes the construction phase. Implementing these technologies would facilitate the discovery of structurally rational solutions.

The study is grounded in the belief that leveraging advanced digital technologies and a multidisciplinary approach can enhance the design process. Numerous successful architectural projects based on these principles validate this approach. The ongoing advancement of digital technologies, particularly performance improvements, allows for the integration of technologies not originally intended for architectural design into the problem-solving process for architectural-engineering issues. Achieving high-quality results depends equally on understanding the problem and the technology used to solve it. Architecture must refine its production methods beyond its traditional scope. In this context, the proposed scientific method for designing unconventional NURBS structures is deemed appropriate.

The study begins with the theory of beam and surface bearing elements in general Spline parametric NURBS coordinates. It formulates a series of isogeometric Kirchhoff shell elements and Bernoulli Euler beam elements of arbitrary continuity, which was not possible with the classical isoperimetric approach. The generalized coordinates of these elements are purely translation displacements of the points on the rod axis and the points on the shell's middle surface. These elements accurately represent the original geometry of the structures, resulting in efficient strain and stress analysis with a relatively small number of finite elements and degrees of freedom of displacements.
