In the 21st century, cities have become the hubs for global networks that facilitate the movement of economies, people, and information. To remain competitive, cities are reevaluating their resources for new development. The quality of urban space significantly contributes to a city's market value, enhancing its appeal for business development and improving living and working conditions. Modern branding strategies increasingly rely on image marketing, making the creation of a high-quality urban environment crucial for a city's global reputation. 

The neoliberal approach is reshaping urban development strategies, aiming to restructure all urban systems and urban planning, management, and design mechanisms. The main models for contemporary city development are based on integrating knowledge in city management (smart city), a creative approach to local governance in social, economic, and cultural practices and city planning (creative city), and sustainable social, economic, and spatial development, resilient in response to political, social, and natural challenges posed by climate and other environmental changes (sustainable and resilient city). 

The development of European cities in the early 21st century is closely tied to their physical context. The European Union (EU) has developed a range of strategies, agendas, and policies to strengthen the capacities of their cities in the growing urban market. The treatment of heritage areas is central to the spatial transformations of European cities. 

The value of historic buildings extends beyond real estate market price, contributing to a sophisticated value-need perception, which helps characterize them as an authentic and unique local social and economic asset. Heritage areas, whether officially protected or not, are being recognized as valuable cultural capital. At the same time, a sense of economic capital is based on the significant growth of creative and cultural-based economies and tourism in the new urban economy. 

The size of cities, in both national and European urban networks, influences the dimensions, character, and pace of their transformations. Medium-sized cities in Eastern Europe, burdened with obsolete production capacities and decaying urban infrastructures after the fall of the Iron Curtain, often found their most valuable potential resource for reinvention in their spatial capacities, especially in historic zones. 

The European Capital of Culture (ECoC) project, one of the most successful EU initiatives, has been highly effective in motivating to build up local capacity for urban change. From the beginning of this century, candidate selection has targeted medium-sized regional centers of up to 500,000 inhabitants. 

In the preparation process, these cities focused on an individual project concentrating on the traditional city core, historic neighborhoods around the city center, brownfield sites, areas containing iconic architecture, and public areas and parkland. Besides refurbishing mostly derelict heritage areas, the construction of new, culturally iconic, architecture was effective in raising cities’ contemporary visual identity. 

The city of Novi Sad, on the southeast border of Central Europe, saw in the bidding process for European Capital of Culture in 2021 an opportunity for regional repositioning after a long period of decline in the specific transition of the Republic of Serbia. The characteristic of Novi Sad, as the second regional political, industrial, and cultural center in the Republic of Serbia, pointed to the need to find new expressions for the city’s social, economic, and cultural potential, which could be realized through the renewal and transformation of the city’s heritage areas. 

A proposed strategy of possible spatial development projects in Novi Sad’s heritage areas for ECoC 2021, would build on the methodology already applied in other Central European Capitals of Culture. In Novi Sad’s case, new projects would be initiated in the following heritage areas: the city center, the historic neighborhoods around the city center, brownfield locations, iconic architecture promotion areas, and public and green spaces within these areas. 

The spatial transformations within Novi Sad’s heritage areas, beside achieving physical renewal, will create a new city development platform, using existing initiatives in creative and cultural practices. If supported by the local authorities, new urban planning, management, and design directives will establish new practices in the spatial development of Novi Sad, which will strengthen its potential to be a successful candidate for the ECoC.
