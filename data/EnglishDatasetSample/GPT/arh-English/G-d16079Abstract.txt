This study investigates the factors that influence the acceptability of public squares by users and local communities, either positively or negatively. It focuses on the challenges faced during the reconstruction of public squares in Serbia. These challenges, or deviations, are primarily due to the unique characteristics of these spaces, the involvement of numerous stakeholders, insufficient information, and other uncertainties during project execution. 

To systematically manage these risks, a risk management model has been developed. This model outlines the process of identifying, assessing, and planning responses to risks, and integrating risk management into other project activities. 

The research began with an examination of selected public square reconstruction projects to understand the conditions under which they were realized. The Delphi method was used to identify risks that could impact the acceptability of the public square. 

The second part of the research presents a risk management model to assist investors in their decision-making process. This model allows investors to identify, analyze, and control risks that could affect the acceptability of the space at the early stages of the project. 

The model encourages decision-makers to systematically consider the effects on accessibility, flexibility, versatility, recognizability, and comfort of the space. Based on these considerations, they can plan strategies to mitigate or eliminate threats and enhance opportunities during the project. 

The research contributes to the advancement of knowledge in urban design, reconstruction, and transformation of public squares through the application of risk management methodologies. The practical application of the research results aims to enhance existing practices and methodologies of state sector investment projects and redefine the role of architects in planning, designing, and constructing public squares in line with modern investment project management principles.
