The term 'expressionism' is typically associated with a stylistic movement in architecture and the arts that emerged in the early 20th century and lasted until 1930. However, a broader interpretation of the term suggests that expressionism is not just a style, but a fundamental creative tendency in all arts throughout history. This paper explores the potential influence of expressionism on Serbian architectural culture in the 20th century, despite the prevailing belief that expressionism had little impact on Serbian architecture. Through a critical analysis of theoretical positions in literature, we investigated the similarities and differences between the fundamental aesthetic categories of 'expression' and 'expressiveness', and their connection to expressionism. Our goal was to provide a clearer understanding of expressionism and establish its presence in Serbian architecture. We studied notable expressionist works in global architecture to identify expressionist principles and characteristics, and then examined their presence in leading Serbian architectural examples. Our comparative analysis of selected 20th-century Serbian architectural works, identified as expressionist in reference books, concludes that expressionism is a key principle and a fundamental creative tendency in 20th-century Serbian architecture. Furthermore, expressionism in Serbia did not emerge concurrently with other parts of Europe (1905-1930). Instead, its emergence can be traced back to the early 1960s, when the first projects and realizations featuring full expressionist articulation appeared, challenging existing scientific perspectives.
