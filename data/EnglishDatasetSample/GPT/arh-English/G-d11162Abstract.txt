The doctoral thesis explores ways to enhance Belgrade's social housing model and implement innovative strategies in line with modern urban planning and project design paradigms, aiming to improve housing conditions and services. The study assumes a correlation between sustainable social housing concepts and definitions, integral to a socially responsible state's housing policy, and the analytical study of sustainable development principles and their application in urban planning and project design.

The research uncovers issues with Serbia's current, underdeveloped social housing model, marked by an incomplete legal and institutional framework, lack of financial mechanisms and human resources, and a stringent market for social housing placement, testing, and evaluation. The existing model fails to meet the population's housing needs and is burdened with urbanization issues, increasing poverty, including energy poverty, environmental impacts, marginalization, and reduced social cohesion and inclusion of social housing recipients.

The study suggests improving the current social housing model by establishing a new approach that considers introducing innovations in urban planning and project design based on social, economic, and environmental sustainability. The research focuses on analyzing and discussing these aspects, crucial for the model's sustainability, including the legal and institutional, socio-economic, and technological aspects of social housing. The analysis was conducted for Europe and Serbia, aiming to define criteria and indicators for a sustainable social housing model for Belgrade.

The thesis also analyzes sustainable social housing models from selected European Union countries, including Vienna, Ljubljana, and Malmö, whose innovative and sustainable solutions have implications beyond their borders. Serbia's social housing practice faces numerous constraints due to the lack of an adequate model. Besides establishing a complete legal and institutional framework and expanding financing mechanisms, a significant challenge is creating a methodology for urban planning and project design for social housing that aligns with modern standards and technological innovations.

To establish an improved social housing model in Belgrade, the study collected primary literature on built and planned social housing from 2003 to the present and conducted research, analysis, and classification of implemented social housing programs and projects in Belgrade. The study established criteria and specific indicators linked to the three pillars of sustainability – social, economic, and environmental sustainability. The study evaluated Belgrade's existing social housing model using these criteria and indicators and proposed improvements and innovations for future social housing projects in Belgrade and other Serbian cities. The study also examined the impact of design and energy system selection on the energy concept of a social housing building in Belgrade. The thesis considers sustainable social housing as a tool for enhancing social inclusion and cohesion, improving housing conditions and services, combating poverty and energy poverty, protecting the environment, and promoting renewable energy use.
