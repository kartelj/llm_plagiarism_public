This research primarily investigates the connection between thought and creative models within the sphere of architecture. The modern architectural landscape is characterized by a variety of cultural discourses, encompassing a range of ideas in architectural theory and design epistemology. The decline of the modernist movement resulted in the loss of a dominant architectural ideology, methodology, or style. As a result, the variety of postmodern cultural discourses both permits and requires the author to establish a reflective basis for their creative endeavors. This raises the question of the relationship between thinking and creating in architecture, particularly the potential for thinking through architecture. Given that the process of thinking falls within the domain of philosophy, examining the intersection of architecture and philosophy can facilitate the shift from thinking about architecture to thinking through architecture. The mutual interest between architecture and philosophy has historically benefited both fields, leading to questions about the existence of a genuinely architectural concept. This research, therefore, explores the potential for knowledge exchange between architecture and philosophy. The potential for transferring the epistemology (or thinking model) from philosophy to architecture is examined in this study, specifically through the application of the principle of continuity, introduced by philosopher Gilles Deleuze, to interior design theory. The study investigates how this transformed interior design theory could lead to the emergence of new interior design model concepts. In recent decades, new design tools and techniques have been developed under the influence of Deleuze's theory. This raises questions about the inherent logic of architectural design methodology at a conceptual level. As a discourse that shapes the living environment, architecture simultaneously addresses practical and philosophical issues. Therefore, the realization of this framework is always linked with the philosophical principles of the era. Over the last century, the intricate process by which prevailing philosophical attitudes have been incorporated into architectural practice has been revealed due to the rapid development of architectural theory. Major shifts in architectural paradigms have often been tested through the treatment of interior space, whether by establishing individual/social relationships, interior object and space organization models, or interior/exterior relationships. In the interplay of tangible and intangible phenomena in architecture, the interior is often viewed as addressing issues of meaning, through the direct interaction of body and space and as a site of intense dialogue between philosophy, psychology, and architecture. Deleuze's theory has influenced architectural theory and practice in various ways over the last half-century, demonstrating the limitless possibilities for forming the theoretical basis for an architectural act. This study identifies the principle of continuity as a new thinking model that breaks down the dialectical logic used in previous understandings of the world to establish new models for architectural design. This model operates by identifying seeds that can be developed into something new and different, while maintaining a connection with the past and the present, thereby always providing new material for further development. The concept of interconnectedness, which encourages the discovery of contacts between heterogeneous flows, can reveal the unseen connections that form the creative potential of our world. This study contributes to the search for methods that reveal the other and different in architecture, something that is not familiar or identical but alien. Furthermore, this study attempts to resonate a philosophical concept as a key to uncovering architecture's own creative instincts and identity. Design methods formed by this resonance activate the unknown as a creative mechanism that can find new connections to drive further shifts in design paradigms. The study views the openness provided by Deleuze's philosophical platform as the main context for developing these methods, leading to the formulation of three new potential interior design methods: Destabilization, Weaving, and Tagging.
