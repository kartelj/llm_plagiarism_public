The proposed research focuses on architecture exhibitions held in socialist Yugoslavia post-World War II. Given the increasing number of studies on architectural exhibitions globally, and those specifically related to the history of socialist Yugoslavia with a focus on architecture and urbanism, these exhibitions are viewed as collective activities. Studying them provides a broader understanding of the social, economic, political, and cultural events in post-war Yugoslavia, and the role architecture played within them. 

The research aims to explore the potential of these exhibitions to be part of, and simultaneously shape, the discourse of architecture. This is primarily seen as a platform for dialogue between architects and the public, or as a venue for promoting or critiquing architectural ideas. Architectural exhibitions are perceived as both a cause and an effect of broader social, cultural, political, and economic changes. 

This research framework allows for further exploration and analysis of exhibition practices in architecture, as well as post-war architectural modalities in Yugoslavia. The exhibitions are not viewed as isolated events showcasing architectural works during certain periods of socialist Yugoslavia. Instead, they are seen as a framework for the production, reception, and evaluation of architecture, through an analysis of the entire exhibition organization process, selection criteria, thematic framework, and exhibition venue. 

By studying architecture exhibitions throughout socialist Yugoslavia's existence, we can monitor phenomena and changes within architectural theory and practice. This can reveal the status of architecture in Yugoslav society and its role within the Yugoslav cultural space.
