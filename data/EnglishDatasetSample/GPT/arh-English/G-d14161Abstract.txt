The use of green walls is not a novel idea in the creation of building facades. Incorporating plants into architectural structures can be an effective method for developing the facades of both new and existing buildings. Green walls represent one of the more advanced and innovative concepts in sustainable building technology. This is evidenced by the original large-scale buildings featuring green walls, which enhance the overall architectural design and play a crucial role in enhancing the buildings' thermal properties. This study investigates the potential of emerging technologies in creating green walls in architectural structures, their thermal properties, and the design potential of the building envelope under Belgrade's climatic conditions. The research indicates that the suggested design principles for green walls can be successfully applied to the building envelope under Belgrade's climatic conditions. The paper presents a review of technical innovations that can be utilized in the design process to reduce thermal impacts on structures. The research verifies the potential for enhancing a building's thermal performance by using a green wall as the building envelope.
