Over the past several decades, the construction industry has seen significant technological advancements. Modern public buildings are often constructed from glass and steel, materials that epitomize contemporary technology. However, residential buildings continue to be built primarily from concrete and brick, using techniques that have remained largely unchanged since the 1970s. This raises the question of whether there is potential for increased use of wood in the construction of modern residential buildings. Currently, wood is primarily used for decorative purposes in architecture. 

The main arguments for promoting the use of wood are its ecological benefits, health benefits, social acceptability, and aesthetic appeal. The success of constructing new homes using wood depends on whether the overall costs can compete with those of other construction materials. Wood has become an increasingly popular material for homes and the interiors of public buildings, with surveys showing that people appreciate having wood in their living environments. 

The term "industrial" production is often associated with poor quality, but this should not be the case. Industrial production of wooden elements and entire houses should result in better quality compared to on-site construction. 

This research involves a comparative analysis of the construction and use of bondruck and prefabricated assemblage buildings, using examples from the Skopje area. The aim is to highlight the advantages of these types of buildings over traditional buildings, from both a technical and energy-saving perspective. 

The main objective of this research is to develop a model for evaluating bondruck and lightweight assemblage systems, taking into account several factors including appearance, thermal and sound insulation, fire resistance, cost-effectiveness, structural system, construction process, joints and connections, flexibility, and energy savings. 

Through this evaluation and comparison, new and innovative concepts for structural systems and single-family house architecture can be explored. By using this method of analysis, the benefits of bondruck and lightweight assemblage systems can be recognized, potentially leading to a resurgence of traditional architectural forms with a contemporary twist, depending on the materials used and the level of materialization and finishes. This research is conducted using a variety of methods and techniques, including analysis, comparison, synthesis, field research and measurements, case studies, and interviews.
