The PhD thesis explores the issue of transforming brownfield sites within the framework of modern urban development and sustainable urban regeneration strategies. It specifically focuses on the significance and role of maintaining the identity and renewing the industrial heritage for the purpose of contributing to urban regeneration planning. The study highlights adaptive reuse as a sustainable regeneration model for industrial brownfields, which involves integrating abandoned industrial sites into the urban environment and adapting them for new uses within the new socio-economic context. Despite the recognized importance of preserving industrial heritage value and achieving social and cultural objectives in the adaptive reuse process, the primary goals of the industrial brownfield regeneration program are identified as economic and ecological. This approach often overlooks the historical, spatial, and cultural values of these sites, leading to the permanent loss of cultural, natural, and architectural heritage and urban identity, resulting in unsustainable regeneration models. The research hypothesizes that the historical, social, cultural, and spatial values of industrial heritage should be considered in urban regeneration planning. It also suggests that these values represent significant development potential, and preserving identity and renewing industrial heritage can contribute to sustainable brownfield regeneration and urban identity improvement. The research questions include what should be preserved in an abandoned industrial complex, what constitutes its identity and unique character, and how to develop transformation models that preserve and enhance its identity and achieve positive regeneration effects. The research was conducted using various methods from architecture, urbanism, sociology, and environmental or urban psychology. The primary research methods included logical argumentation, scientific content analysis, and case study method. The case study method incorporated survey and urbomorphological methods. The research results underscore the importance of achieving socio-cultural objectives and preserving industrial heritage identity and values in industrial brownfield regeneration. The research also defines the scientific concept of industrial brownfield identity and the spatial, functional, and cultural values that guide the regeneration process. The research presents a typological classification of brownfields as an analytical tool for studying industrial heritage values, which is crucial for selecting a planning approach to brownfield regeneration. The research also presents a case study of brownfield regeneration and defines spatial patterns for transforming industrial brownfields in the urban regeneration process. The research contributes to the field of urban regeneration by proposing a scientifically based approach to transforming industrial brownfields to preserve and enhance their identity and adapt them for new uses within the context of modern city development. The research's scientific and theoretical contribution is the definition of the scientific concept of industrial brownfield identity and their spatial, functional, and cultural values. The research's scientific and methodological contribution is the development of an analytical tool for defining the relationship with industrial heritage values, which is crucial for selecting a planning approach to brownfield regeneration. The research also offers practical recommendations for planning industrial brownfield regeneration and enhancing the contemporary approach to preserving industrial heritage in urban regeneration processes in Banjaluka and the wider region.
