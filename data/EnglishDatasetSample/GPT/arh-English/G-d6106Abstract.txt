The study of Cupolae, which are geometric forms with concave polyhedral surfaces, is not only interesting from a mathematical perspective but also has practical applications in architecture and construction. These polyhedra, known as Concave Cupolae, are generated using the same method as Johnsonâ€™s solids, but differ in that they do not meet the convexity criterion and feature two or more series of equilateral triangles on their lateral surfaces. The type of Cupola is determined by the number of rows of equilateral triangles on the lateral surface's plane net. These triangles are arranged into spatial hexahedral elements that are polar arrayed around the polyhedron's central axis, forming a deltahedral lateral surface. 

There are multiple different Concave Cupolae of the same type that can be constructed on the same polygonal base. The thesis applies geometric constructions and other graphic procedures, including 3D modeling, to represent any Cupola from the observed group. This approach has facilitated the discovery of correlations between the parameters, dimensions, and elements of the solids. MATLAB software enables the modeling of the fourth type of Concave Cupolae. 

The study has systematized the properties of Concave Cupolae, determining the maximum number of representatives for each type and the basic parameters for higher types of Concave Cupolae. These constructions allow for the parameters of the solids to be determined analytically using iterative numerical procedures. The study also presents new polyhedral structures obtained by varying concave bicupolae using gyrations, elongations, gyroelongations, and augmentations. 

Concave Cupolae can also be elongated using Concave Antiprisms of the second type, the geometric generation of which has been detailed. The study establishes the link between theoretical concepts and their practical applications in architecture, demonstrating that these polyhedral structures have practical uses.
