The ongoing shifts in social, physical, technological, and economic contexts significantly impact the functional physical structure of modern residential buildings. These changes spur the rapid development of new strategies and the reevaluation of traditional residential concepts. The emergence and implementation of the transformability concept are closely tied to the fact that traditional residential architecture does not cater to the needs of the modern resident, which can often be unpredictable and undefined. The principles of design are evolving, simultaneously challenging the design patterns of modern residential buildings. 

This study underscores the significance of applying transformation principles in the architectural design methodology of modern residential buildings. It also introduces new analytical queries that contribute to the expansion of knowledge in the design process. The investigation and analysis of the transformation principle, grounded in architectural design, highlight the importance of identifying the fundamental features that shape the concept of transformable residential buildings. These buildings can adapt to the constant changes brought about by the needs of current users and the environment. 

The goal of implementing the transformability concept is to enhance a building's functionality. Therefore, this research is committed to establishing and elucidating the transformation principles applied in the architectural design of modern residential buildings during their project's conceptual phase. It focuses on the challenges of designing buildings that can be transformed even after their construction. 

The analysis of the transformation concept of modern residential buildings is conducted through the examination of reference examples, based on previously observed transformation models and the primary influences on the concept's development. The examples are analyzed based on the applied transformation of the interior space plan and the transformation of the object membrane. While the functional analysis of the residential spaces' structure is not highlighted, this research seeks to establish principles that, when applied, will facilitate diverse functions and forms. 

This academic research explores the physical and perceptual transformation of residential structures, emphasizing that visual and physical transformation are interdependent and inseparable. However, the physical transformation of an object, which involves the spatial-mechanical movement of the basic constructive elements, is the primary focus of this study. 

This research also aims to clarify the role of transformation principles in the architectural design of modern residential buildings and to promote further research in this area. The goal is to develop and enhance the application of transformation principles in the design's conceptual phase and to meet the specific needs of a modern resident. It also aims to accommodate other influences that render traditional residential architecture inflexible.
