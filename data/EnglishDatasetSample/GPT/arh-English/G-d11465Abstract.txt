Lighting plays a vital role in creating the atmosphere at night. Traditionally, high-quality ambient lighting was achieved using metal-halide lamps with a ceramic discharge tube due to their warm-white light and excellent colour rendering. These features made them ideal for urban lighting, enhancing the environment and creating a pleasant atmosphere. However, in recent years, LED lamps have been touted as the perfect solution for ambient lighting due to their small size, controlled light beam, and the ability to adjust both the intensity and colour of light, making them particularly suitable for architectural lighting. 

The question arose whether LED lamps are also suitable for ambient lighting, considering the characteristics of urban environments that need to be highlighted and the effects to be achieved. While the photometric, energy, and economic indicators of LED lamps can be measured or calculated, other important characteristics such as colour appearance, colour rendering, subjective impression of glare, sense of security and relaxation in an illuminated space, and the ability to emphasize elements and details can only be assessed through subjective impressions. 

This doctoral dissertation not only verifies the objective aspects but also evaluates the subjective indicators of the quality of ambient lighting. The subjective indicators were assessed through a pilot project on a pedestrian lane in a Belgrade park. The dissertation presents the factors affecting the quality of ambient lighting and the characteristics of urban environments that should be highlighted by lighting. It also provides guidelines for ambient lighting based on analyzed examples of lighting solutions for squares, parks, and pedestrian lanes. 

A pilot project involving 112 participants compared the subjective impressions of ambient lighting installations using LED and metal-halide lamps. The results showed that participants preferred the conventional lighting installation in all analyzed aspects. This could be due to the LED spectrum's intensive radiation in the blue region, making metal-halide lamps more suitable for colour appearance and colour rendering. 

The objective indicators of the quality of ambient lighting installations using LED and metal-halide lamps were compared through photometric calculations. It was found that energy savings of up to 35.5% could be achieved by installing LED lamps, but in some cases, electricity consumption increased by up to 31.5%. The economic evaluation showed that some LED lighting solutions were up to 29.2% cheaper, but most were more expensive. 

Given the current state of LED technology and its light spectrum, it is unlikely that LED technology will match the spectrum quality of metal-halide lamps in the near future. Therefore, the use of metal-halide light sources in ambient lighting is likely to continue for years to come.
