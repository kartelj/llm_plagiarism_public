The creation and development of this paper began with the goal of investigating, scrutinizing, and revealing previously unknown archival materials that exposed extensive construction activities during the interwar period. Through the organization and analysis of these materials, and by explaining certain phenomena, we aimed to illustrate the lesser-known endeavors of the Architectural Department of the Ministry of Construction from 1919 to 1941. To better understand this significant era in modern Serbian civil engineering, and to assess it, we utilized previously published papers and materials from the interwar period. 

A primary objective of this paper is to showcase the organization and operations of the Architectural Department of the Ministry of Construction during the interwar period, within a wider socio-economic context. We explored its actual position and role in the intricate process of architectural and urban design of settlements across the country by examining the department's range of activities, competencies, and functioning, construction methods, tender processes, and both realized and unrealized designs developed at the Ministry. 

By investigating preserved materials and reconstructing the creation process of certain public buildings, we have illuminated the complex process of their construction, from inception to completion. During the interwar period, the Architectural Department of the Ministry of Construction utilized its creative abilities, legislation, and clear work methods in the design and construction of public buildings and urban planning, establishing a significant creative and professional potential for modern Serbian architecture. 

The Ministry of Construction, as the supreme construction administrative and supervisory authority, was a key influence on the development of architecture in this region. The variety of activities undertaken by the Architectural Department of the Ministry of Construction during the interwar period is evident in cities, towns, and small towns across the country. The designs, urban, and regulation plans developed by the Ministry of Construction during this period shaped the physical characteristics and architectural and urban aesthetics that, in most cases, have remained unchanged to this day.
