The thesis introduces a design concept for earthquake-resistant architectural structures, utilizing unconventional materials such as laminated glass and laminated klirit. These materials, while common and easily accessible, are not typically used for this purpose, hence their unconventional label. The design concept involves using these materials as fillers in a steel frame, overlapped by a rubber layer, creating a composite assembly. This forms vertical stiffening elements capable of absorbing seismic forces and integrating into the building's structural system. The system's effectiveness was confirmed through laboratory experiments, where models based on these materials were subjected to cyclic loads simulating seismic forces. This tested the load capacity of the composite assemblies under dynamic loads parallel to the assembly plane. The experiments determined the potential stress intensity and the extent of structure stiffening in relation to deformation, as well as the benefits of one filler type over the other. A computer model of the structure was created using specialized software based on the finite element method, which was used for initial problem analysis in the design process. The laboratory-tested stiffening system was incorporated into the computer model. The results from the computer model, including modal analysis and seismic calculations, demonstrated the effectiveness of this solution, completing the design procedures for earthquake-resistant stiffening using unconventional materials.
