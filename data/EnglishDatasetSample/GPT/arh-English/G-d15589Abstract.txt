This study explores the potential for enhancing the energy efficiency of existing industrial structures in the Republic of Serbia by applying a double skin façade during the building envelope's rehabilitation. The goal is to assess the double skin façade's influence on the energy requirements for heating and cooling industrial buildings during rehabilitation, as well as the effectiveness of these measures in improving the energy efficiency of selected industrial building types and models. The energy performance of these buildings was determined using the DesignBuilder and EnergyPlus simulation software, considering thermal comfort parameters and Serbian climate data. The energy simulation results were compared based on the criteria of maximizing energy savings and minimizing carbon dioxide emissions. The research methodology involved creating a typology of Serbian industrial buildings, selecting specific buildings based on their properties, and using numerical simulation to investigate energy rehabilitation opportunities. The results were then compared and the building types were ranked according to their energy performance. The main aim of this research was to examine the impact of the double skin façade on the energy efficiency of various industrial buildings and to identify the best approach for energy rehabilitation of existing industrial buildings using a double skin façade in Serbia's climate conditions.
