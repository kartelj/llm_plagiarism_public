This dissertation begins with the hypothesis that the aesthetic consciousness evident in the architecture of the objects studied signifies the aesthetic consciousness of the authors, and therefore the existence of creative processes in the authors of the architectural work. This leads to the assumption that the presence of creative processes implies a deliberate use of specific aesthetic elements, indicating aesthetic consciousness. It is therefore inferred that, if present, a) the deliberate use of specific aesthetic elements, b) the creative process, and c) aesthetic consciousness are always interconnected. 

The dissertation then examines and presents a recognized causal relationship: after reviewing observational aesthetic elements, it focuses on experiential aesthetic elements. The presence of these elements suggests the author’s aesthetic consciousness and the existence of a creative process within the author. 

Specifically, the dissertation investigates and presents the use of experiential aesthetic elements: 1) aesthetic intent, 2) intuition, 3) imagination, and 4) speculative thinking. This is done through the display, systematization, and evaluation of all 31 public buildings on the “Bulevar oslobodjenjaž Boulevard in Novi Sad, Serbia. 

The analysis of this architectural/urban sample, along with an evaluation of the employed aesthetic aspects, not only demonstrates the presence of aesthetic consciousness but also its level in the author and thus the quality of the architecture from this period. 

By highlighting the significant responsibility of architects/artists and professionals as creators of society, this dissertation aims to contribute to the comprehensive theoretical and practical study of aesthetics, aesthetic consciousness, and creative processes in architecture. This is demonstrated through the aesthetic analysis of the architecture of the “Bulevar oslobodjenjaž Boulevard in Novi Sad, Serbia. The dissertation also aims to contribute to the scientific description and explanation of contemporary Serbian architecture from the second half of the twentieth century and the first decade of the twenty-first century.
