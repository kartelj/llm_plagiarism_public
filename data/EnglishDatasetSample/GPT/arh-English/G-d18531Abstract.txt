The late 20th and early 21st centuries saw a global interaction of negative social and economic factors, leading to a polarisation of spatial development. This resulted in the creation of global cities that were able to integrate into the global network, but also increased disparities between cities and led to the global phenomenon of shrinking cities. Studies indicate that urban stagnation is becoming more common in Central and Eastern Europe, the United States, developed Asian countries, North America, and Australia. European city data reveals that many cities began to shrink in the 1960s, with stagnation becoming more prevalent than growth and development in the 1990s. 

Research conducted in the northwestern region of the Republic of Srpska, where 15 out of 17 cities are experiencing urban shrinkage, suggests that this issue is not confined to Europe and developed countries. This supports the theory that urban stagnation is more dominant than urban growth and development in the Republic of Srpska. 

The research contributes to the field by defining a model for identifying, mapping, and typologically classifying shrinking cities. Recognising the vulnerability of cities affected by stagnation and the current planning and management practices' inability to address these challenges in the Republic of Srpska, the research proposes a new methodological approach. This approach aims to establish a more efficient and operational system for planning and managing stagnating cities. 

The concept of adaptive management, primarily developed in ecology and natural resources management, served as the foundation for researching and defining the methodology of integral adaptive management. The study also examined different planning modalities in the Republic of Srpska, focusing on their approach to urban stagnation, the extent of participation, negotiation and decision-making models, and their attitude towards learning. 

The study analysed the analogy between existing planning models in the Republic of Srpska and the concept of adaptive management, confirming the efficiency of the adaptive model. The case study concluded that the informal planning model is significantly more adaptive and efficient in implementation than the formal model. However, both models deviated from the adaptive approach and had several weaknesses, which were addressed through guidelines for improving the existing planning systems in the Republic of Srpska. 

Ultimately, the doctoral thesis's key contribution is the enhancement and development of planning theory and resilience theory through the integration of their key concepts and ideas.
