Over the past several decades, the construction of energy-efficient social housing in the most advanced EU nations has evolved from isolated experimental projects to a highly successful emerging trend. The ongoing development of social housing quality is undeniably shifting towards enhancing its energy efficiency. In recent years, Serbia has started to set up an institutional and legislative framework for both building energy efficiency and social housing, a first since the collapse of the previous socialist regime. Despite the fact that the total social housing stock in Serbia is relatively new (since 2005), this study revealed that the energy performance of these buildings falls short of the new energy efficiency standards (established in 2012) in Serbia. The objective of this dissertation was to determine the type of energy-efficient social housing construction that would be suitable for Serbia, taking into account all relevant Serbian characteristics. To achieve this, a new methodology based on the creation, analysis, and evaluation of Materialisation Models was developed and presented in this dissertation. The energy efficiency of these Models is achieved solely through architectural means, in line with the expertise of the architectural profession. Based on a prior analysis of Serbian social housing stock, four representative building types suitable for future social housing in Serbia were identified, along with anticipated energy efficiency levels. Correspondingly, a number of Materialisation Models were created to represent these. The energy characteristics of the Models were calculated using professional software to obtain precise values for their annual heating energy demand, energy class, and CO2 emissions. The Models were then compared and evaluated based on previously determined criteria. As a result, eighteen Materialisation Models were identified as a range of suitable future building solutions for energy-efficient social housing in Serbia. In each specific case, the optimal solution can be found by selecting one of these eighteen Materialisation Models with the most appropriate energy characteristics for the specific location. The research findings and conclusions drawn in this dissertation were converted into guidelines for designing future energy-efficient social housing buildings in Serbia. The succinct methodology for creating, analyzing, and evaluating Materialisation Models established in this dissertation is not only applicable to social housing in Serbia, but can also be applied to any other type of building in any other country.
