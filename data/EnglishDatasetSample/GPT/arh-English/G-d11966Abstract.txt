The thesis focuses on the exploration of art installations as 'spatial practices', which are developed and executed within the intersection of artistic and architectural projects. The research primarily seeks to introduce alternative spatial concepts that establish a new relationship between the subject and spatial order, as well as novel methods of space appropriation. The thesis utilizes a theoretical discourse rooted in architectural design methodology and contemporary art theory to examine reference examples that demonstrate how certain spatial situations are investigated through installations created by artists and architects. 

Positioning art installations as 'spatial practices' within the research fields of art and architecture necessitates a critical examination of reference texts that discuss the concept of 'betweenness', thereby lending an interdisciplinary aspect to the research. The initial hypothesis of the thesis suggests that art installations pave the way for a new area of architectural research in the development and execution of projects. This allows art installations to be considered within architectural theory and practice as a unique form of creativity that challenges and alters the established relationship between the conception and realization of architectural projects. 

The hypothesis is largely based on interpretations of contemporary architectural and art theories, which suggest that by employing the principles used in the design and execution of artistic installations, architects can invigorate the design process by adopting a less restrictive framework and liberating architecture, defining its own media (Rendell 2006; Grosz, 2001; Hill, 1998; Bonnemaison & Eisenbach, 2009). Therefore, by incorporating the characteristics of art installations into architectural design research, the established order of architectural design aimed at creating independent professional positions is challenged. 

Given that this research was conducted on the 'diagonal axis' between art and architecture, the thesis contributes in two ways. The first set of results summarizes key concepts of art installations within the field of art research through individual case studies. The second set of results highlights the potential and significance of art installation concepts in architectural design, summarizing these concepts as architectural categories through case studies. 

The study underscores the importance of the role of art installations in architectural design and introduces new research questions that contribute to the advancement of knowledge in the design process. Furthermore, the study of art installations from the perspective of architectural design emphasizes the importance of interdisciplinarity in design and research, and the significance of integrating art principles into architectural design with the goal of fostering an innovative approach to design issues.
