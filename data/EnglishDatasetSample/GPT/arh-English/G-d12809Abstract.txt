The escalating energy consumption, driven by industrial growth and improved living standards, is depleting natural resources and polluting the environment, indirectly contributing to global climate change. In the Republic of Srpska (Bosnia and Herzegovina), approximately 51.8% of total energy is used in buildings, making energy optimization of buildings a priority and long-term goal. The primary objective of this research is to identify representative samples of existing residential buildings in Banja Luka, which will serve as reference points for implementing energy optimization measures for building envelopes. 

This study explores the climatic characteristics of Banja Luka that are relevant to energy optimization of building envelopes, and provides information on suitable materials for this purpose. It also offers recommendations and a methodology for optimizing the energy efficiency of existing residential building envelopes in Banja Luka and beyond. 

Designing and implementing energy efficiency measures to optimize building envelopes and ensure thermal comfort requires architects and other design professionals to have a thorough understanding of these measures and their potential applications. The goal is to evaluate energy efficiency parameters for representative samples, including specific energy consumption for heating and CO2 emissions, and to analyze refurbishment measures. This involves examining suitable materials available in the Bosnian and Herzegovinian market from an energy and economic perspective, and establishing reference models for refurbishing the building envelopes of representative samples. 

This research presents an analysis of the energy savings and cost-effectiveness of measures applied to optimize the energy efficiency of the entire envelope of specified samples. The study's findings offer suitable proposals for the maximum/limit of U-value [W/(m2K)] - thermal transmittance for building envelope elements, considering Banja Luka's climatic conditions. This research also examines the technical and economic parameters of materials and measures for energy optimization of building envelopes, and identifies specific improvements for the building envelopes of representative samples of existing residential buildings in Banja Luka. The methodologies used and the results obtained provide an overview of the parameters that affect energy consumption for heating in buildings, and aid in creating reference models for refurbishing the building envelopes of existing residential buildings.
