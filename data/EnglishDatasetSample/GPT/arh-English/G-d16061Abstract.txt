This study explores the relationship between architectural expression, its symbolic significance, and its role as a conduit for communication between the observer and the creation. It also delves into how the spatial-physical context impacts the development of symbolic concepts in memorial architecture design. The research posits that architectural expression, as a fusion of form and function within a specific spatial-physical context, conveys the essence and meaning of a spatial solution and the architectural form as a whole. 

The research methodology is rooted in symbolic theory, which provides a framework for interpreting memorial architecture and the experience it offers. The symbolism inherent in architectural expression is examined through the lens of symbolic theory, interpreting the artistic expression conveyed by the architectural design and defining the characteristics of the architectural-urban setting. 

This scholarly work involves an in-depth analysis of the functional solution and form elements setting, which highlight the distinctiveness of architectural expression in memorial architecture. The analysis aims to uncover the symbolic significance of architectural expression in memorial architecture, using examples from authorial practice. This involves analyzing spatial solutions and the combination of structural forms to comprehend the symbolic message communicated between the observer and the work. 

The study places particular emphasis on the importance of the author's approach during the conceptual phase of the architectural-urban design of memorial architecture, where the entire meaning of a work is encapsulated. The symbolism of architectural expression is identified through selected reference examples, specifically designs of memorial architecture, which serve as the specific subjects of the case studies. 

The architectural-urban interpretation of a specific memorial architecture design is conducted through comparative analysis, guided by previously established theoretical aspects of the topic. This facilitates a comprehensive understanding of the architectural design, the symbolic significance of the architectural-urban solution, the symbolism of form and function, and the design concept of the memorial architecture work. 

The study seeks to acknowledge the role of symbolism in architectural expression in memorial architecture as a vehicle for conveying the meaning of a work. It aims to enhance understanding of the symbolism of architectural expression, grounded in previously established theoretical foundations, and presented in two ways: as a means of understanding the symbolic function of a work (through architectural analysis) and as a means of understanding and interpreting symbolic forms in memorial architecture works.
