This thesis highlights the importance of fostering a conversation between thorough morphological studies and planning and design practices. It explores the potential of connecting theoretical development and practical application through the research concept and phenomenon of the city block. The city block serves as a typical morphological entity and an urban level where the impacts and interconnections of planning and design processes become evident. 

By conducting a morphogenetic analysis of a city block, one can discern the nature and origins of either organic or directed urban development processes. Conversely, an examination of the current state and ongoing urban development processes can help predict the suitable physical structure and interpret it at the block level. 

In this scenario, the block can serve as a research concept in architectural and urban planning processes, both in the analysis stage of the current state and in the final stage of formulating guidelines. These guidelines can take the form of planning and building rules or defining a model. 

The development of conceptual city block models involves visualizing the results of morphological and contextual studies and providing a direction for extrapolating theoretical research into planning and design practices. Conversely, practice provides the foundation and material of accumulated knowledge, skills, and innovations from architects and planners, as well as the participation of all stakeholders. This is integrated into the theory through research and evaluation, serving as a springboard for the creation of new concepts and operational modalities.
