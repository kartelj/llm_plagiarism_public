This study explores the concept of performativity in architecture through the lens of performance studies. It aims to elucidate established relationships, trace their origins, and suggest potential interpretations. The research begins with the understanding that performativity encompasses both conceptual and operative realities. It investigates how architecture can deviate from the traditional design process, focusing on the fluidity and instability of boundaries within which architectural ideas and meanings interact on a socio-cultural level. The contemporary perspective on the current state of architecture is derived from linking performativity and architecture. This connection is not only based on visual and formal expressions, but also on a shared fundamental concept.
