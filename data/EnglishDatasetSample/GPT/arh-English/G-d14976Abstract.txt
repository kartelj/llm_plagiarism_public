The Doctoral Dissertation's theoretical stance is rooted in the transdisciplinary research area of modern design practices within the realm of structural engineering in architecture. It delves into the scientific exploration of using recycled materials as components of composites, which can serve as reinforcement bars or other structural elements in architectural designs. The study also highlights the practical application of these materials.

The research outcomes contribute to enhancing the design and execution of construction, and the structures of architectural objects, by introducing new composite materials that promote the building's ecological quality. This aligns with the recommendations for sustainable construction.

The research aims to establish a practical link between existing composite materials data, the current regulatory framework that governs the use of composites, and the experimental research of recycled fiber reinforced polymer composite. The research methodology is grounded in scientific methodology and employs a comparative method to analyze similar or related phenomena and identify their similarities and differences. Analytical and mathematical methods are used to establish a relationship between them, which can be validated with experimental methods.

The first part of the research sets the theoretical framework, analyzing references that offer insight into composite formation, the characteristics of composites, their usage, and the potential for incorporating recycled materials in the composites' manufacturing process, particularly for fiber reinforced polymer composites. The thesis first defines the composite, its structure, and the materials used, then analyzes the properties of polymer composites reinforced with fibers composed of material from primary production. It also examines data about materials suitable for recycling and use in the production of composites from recycled materials.

The second part of the dissertation is structured as a study that includes a theoretical section dealing with the comparative analysis of references and literature of the existing legislative framework, rules, and guidelines in the field that govern the use of composite materials in structural engineering in architecture. It also defines the criteria that composites need to meet. The next section presents relations and an expression based on the analyzed literature and defined criteria, followed by an experimental section that validates the use of tested recycled PET-glass fiber reinforced polymer composite in forming structural elements of architectural structures.

The experimental section is based on a set of relations and expressions and indirectly explores the potential of using recycled composite material in forming structural elements of architectural structures. The second part of the dissertation also evaluates the research results and offers suggestions for the further use of the experimentally tested recycled PET-glass fiber reinforced polymer material.

The proposed hypothesis is verified through field data analysis from the field of structural engineering in architecture, establishing relations, and experimental verification. The thesis's justification arises from the need to discover and utilize new materials while considering ecological factors, ecosystem impact, and sustainable development.

The practical application of the results involves considering possibilities and guidelines for future research and the use of experimentally tested recycled PET-glass fiber reinforced polymer composite in forming structural elements of architectural structures. Broadly, the research contributes to understanding how a related research field can adapt to contemporary problem-solving methods. More specifically, the thesis contributes to research in the field of structural engineering in architecture.

The research contributions include analyzing and understanding the methods of using composite materials in the structural engineering of architectural objects, considering the coverage of regulations in the field of structural engineering in architecture related to composites, setting the relation expressions that define the behavior of composites in forming structural elements of architectural structures, and considering the use of recycled fiber reinforced polymer composite.

The expected research results are improved and more comprehensive scientific knowledge resulting from understanding the relations between architectural structures' subsystems, construction, and construction materials. The practical application should address the challenges posed by increasingly strict environmental standards, thereby maintaining or improving the design and construction quality of architectural objects.
