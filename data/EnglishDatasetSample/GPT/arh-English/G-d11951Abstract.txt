The energy efficiency of a building is influenced by a multitude of factors throughout its entire lifespan, including the laws and codes that govern its design and construction, the quality of its construction and the materials used, as well as the behavior of its occupants, its maintenance, and any potential upgrades or modifications. It is crucial to determine the current state and actual energy efficiency of buildings in order to develop strategies for managing building funds based on the principles of sustainable development and building energy efficiency. This dissertation focuses on the study of the structure and energy efficiency of Serbian multifamily housing constructed post-World War II. The research begins with an analysis of the material properties of these buildings and the relevant codes and regulations, and establishes a suitable periodization. For each period, typical fa√ßade assemblies are identified and examined in depth through the review of technical documentation, energy performance calculations and simulations, and on-site investigations using infrared thermography. The specifics of the infrared thermography method are extensively studied and explained from both theoretical and practical perspectives. All pertinent input factors are identified and clarified, and the potential applications in architecture are determined and investigated, including the limitations and common errors and misunderstandings. Appropriate procedures are established and a series of recommendations are provided to ensure the correct use of the method. The energy efficiency of buildings is examined by calculating relevant parameters based on current regulations, computer simulations, and infrared thermography. The results are compared and thoroughly analyzed, and a catalogue of typical cases is provided.
