This research thesis is predicated on the idea that the selection of a suitable fractal object is crucial in determining rhythm in architectural-urban compositions, as first proposed by Carl Bovill. These fractal objects serve as mathematical models of natural rhythm. The study aims to identify and analyze the parameters that influence the selection of these fractal objects, ensuring that the resulting rhythm mirrors that of nature.

Two types of fractal objects, fractional Brownian functions and random curds, both from the class of random fractals, will be examined. These have been recognized in scientific literature as valid mathematical models for various natural forms and processes. The parameters that influence the selection of these fractal objects are the characteristics of the rhythm they are intended to determine and the characteristics of the fractal objects themselves.

The research also considers the relationship between the rhythm of architectural elements and the fractal object as a model of natural rhythm. This relationship is seen as analogous, and the study draws on Dedre Gentner's structure-mapping theory to explore this.

The research will also examine the characteristics of rhythm in architectural-urban compositions that could influence the selection of a suitable fractal object. These include the number of spatial-temporal determinants needed to specify the position of each individual entity in the composition, the acceptability and desirability of chosen visual feature values, and the relationship between these values.

The study will also look at the characteristics of fractional Brownian functions and random curds to determine their suitability as models. These characteristics include the value of topological and fractal dimensions for fractional Brownian functions, and the Euclidean dimension of the auxiliary network, the number of iterations, and the chosen probability for each step of the process for random curds.

The research will demonstrate that rhythms generated in this way, defined as non-exact due to the component of randomness, will be perceived as natural and more complex and irregular than exact rhythms. It will also explore how the selection of a fractal object with certain mathematical properties can influence the visual complexity of the generated rhythm, and potentially, aesthetic preferences for such rhythm.
