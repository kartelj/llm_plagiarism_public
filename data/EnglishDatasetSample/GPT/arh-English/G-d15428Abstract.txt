The initial section of this thesis focuses on identifying the essential components of the primary religious ceremony in the Christian Orthodox church, the Liturgy, along with other prerequisites. The aim is to ascertain whether these components stem from the church's liturgical needs or have a non-theological basis, and to identify the factors that shape them. The Church, in its fundamental sense, is a liturgical assembly, and a church - or temple - is primarily a space for worship. The Liturgy is the principal factor in shaping the programmatic basis of Orthodox church buildings, with all other influencing factors and programmatic elements being secondary. The symbolic aspect of the architectural program of Orthodox churches is also crucial, but it cannot be directly translated into architectural form. The canons of the Christian Orthodox Church do not directly condition the architectural design of temples. Labeling certain elements of architectural traditions and modern architectural practices as "canonical," even without theological foundation, obstructs the pursuit of contemporary expression in religious architecture. Current architectural practices of Orthodox and other Christian churches highlight the significance of the relationship to tradition, whether it is copied, developed, or rejected. The clash of traditionalist and modernist views and practices in church architecture, as well as liturgical and theological issues, are more pronounced among Roman Catholics and Protestants, but also exist within Orthodox churches. The intertwining of religious and national identity among Orthodox Serbs has led to Orthodox temples becoming symbols of national identity and tradition, perhaps even more so than symbols of religious teaching and tradition. The contemporary architectural design practices of the Serbian Orthodox Church are dominated by a traditionalist approach and historicist expression. By focusing on the superficial, strictly formal qualities of historic architecture as unchanging and binding values, one of the key characteristics of tradition - its constant renewal and continuity of changes from generation to generation - is negated. Instead of tradition and a traditional approach, a traditionalist one, which is contrary to them, is thus supported and nurtured. This area of architectural creation in Serbia, from 1990 to the present, which is the period examined in this thesis, as well as the previous socialist state period, has not been sufficiently researched. The latter part of the thesis is dedicated to analyzing the contemporary design practices and poetics of the most notable authors in this field in our country, based on the number or quality of the churches they have built in the past three decades - Lj. Bošnjak, R. Prokić, P. Ristić, Lj. Folić, S. Krunić, M. Lukić, B. Mitrović, M. Mitrović, B. Pešić and N. Popović. Most authors favor a traditional - mimetic or dynamic - type of poetics. However, there are significant differences among them, as they rely on different elements of tradition, thereby indirectly pointing to the freedom of creation in the field of Orthodox church architecture.
