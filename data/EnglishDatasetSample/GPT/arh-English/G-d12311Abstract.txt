The thesis explores the issue of spatial transformation in inherited public housing neighborhoods for urban regeneration purposes. The neighborhood unit concept, used in planning and designing housing units, has varying effects on quality of life and related issues in different environments. Urbanity issues are evident in both social and spatial domains, seen in poor connections between people and places, and poor livability of public spaces. Many Western European neighborhoods have undergone or are undergoing urban regeneration. Despite recognizing the link between spatial characteristics of neighborhoods and urbanity issues, regenerative measures often remain in the socio-economic domain. 

The study aims to define a model of spatial transformations for public housing neighborhoods that can contribute positively to urban regeneration, particularly enhancing vitality and socialization. The study assumes that the model should be designed with an understanding of the socio-spatial relationship that underlies the neighborhood's collective life patterns. Public spaces and their usage are a crucial part of this relationship. 

The presence of people in open spaces doesn't necessarily mean urbanity exists, but it's a necessary condition for establishing relationships between people and space, and communication among people. The organization and physical characteristics of space influence the relationship between people, their activities, and ideas. 

The study used a mix of basic and specific scientific methods and techniques applicable in architecture, urbanism, and humanities. The research structure is based on an analytical-synthetic method, and the applied basic scientific methods include logical argumentation, scientific analysis, case study, and grounded theory method. Space Syntax techniques were used to analyze the spatial configuration of the case study neighborhood in relation to usage patterns. 

The study's first part shows that open public spaces can be the primary subject of spatial transformation in neighborhood regeneration, renewing vitality, sociability, and connection between people and space. The configuration of public space can influence daily usage patterns, supporting local community identity and its integration into the city's global system. 

The second part of the study presents an analytical tool for analyzing public space configuration, defined as a universally applicable typology based on spatial and sociological theories about space and society relations. The typology's main purpose is to measure the capacity of urban structure and neighborhood architecture to support collective usage patterns of open public spaces. 

The study's results contribute to the urban regeneration discipline. Specifically, it contributes to conceptualizing new approaches to urban design of neighborhood public spaces, based on the analytic theory of urban space's configurational nature and sociological theories about the interconnection of social life and relations with everyday life routine activities. This approach complements the intuitive approach to urban design, reducing the risk of failure in spatial interventions. The study emphasizes the bottom-up approach in regenerating and redesigning neighborhoods, focusing on people and their daily usage patterns of open public space.
