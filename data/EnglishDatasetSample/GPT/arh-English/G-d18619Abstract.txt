The research focuses on the energy efficiency of traditional rammed earth houses in Vojvodina. The study considers a unique architectural feature: the three-part rammed earth house, which was developed from the late 18th to the early 20th century across Vojvodina. The research aims to scientifically analyze and explain the energy efficiency of these traditional single-family homes. The study also explores the potential of these homes in the context of sustainable development in Serbia. This research introduces a new perspective on traditional Vojvodina houses, which have not previously been the focus of scientific research in Serbia. The energy efficiency of the basic three-part house in Vojvodina was examined in three parts: architectural and construction characteristics, in situ measurements, and energy performance calculations. The architectural and construction analysis included urban parameters, building orientation, functional concept, shape, compactness, thermal zoning, and natural ventilation. The thermal performance analysis included heat transfer coefficient U, thermal resistance R, and thermal conductivity λ for individual elements of the house's thermal envelope. In situ measurements were taken on five traditional Vojvodina houses' rammed earth walls during the 2014/2015 heating season over 80 days. Parameters such as air temperature, wall surface temperature, and heat flux were monitored in real time. The average heat transfer coefficient U, thermal resistance R, and thermal conductivity λ for the rammed earth walls were determined based on these measurements. The results were compared with those calculated according to the Regulations on energy efficiency in buildings, revealing significant differences. The energy performance of the house was calculated using KnaufTerm PRO software. The results showed that the three-part house in Vojvodina falls into the G energy grade. However, when the in situ measurements were used instead of the regulatory values, the house was classified as F energy grade. These results highlight the inadequate treatment of traditional building materials and flaws in Serbia's current energy efficiency regulations. The research concluded that the building envelope elements of traditional Vojvodina houses and the rammed earth house as a whole do not meet modern energy efficiency standards. Therefore, the study also proposed measures to improve energy performance and potential functional transformations of the house.
