The paper's primary argument emphasizes the importance of architectural detail in the design process, bridging the gap between various thought processes, design goals, and technological methods. These elements are vital in shaping both the artistic and technical facets of architectural design to reach its tectonic potential. The advent of new digital design tools has made architectural tectonics an increasingly significant field within the architectural discipline. This study aims to comprehend the intricate relationship between the design process and a critical examination of new technical tools, organizational structures, and construction models. By studying tectonic theory and its application in modern architectural practice, the research scrutinizes architectural detail using methodological principles and procedures to facilitate a cohesive conception and actual materialization of the architectural project at a practical and intuitive level. The research's primary viewpoint acknowledges the ambiguity in the concept of architectural detail and design process, providing an opportunity for understanding beyond the existing theoretical and practical classifications. The detail is seen as a specific point where the construction and delineation of an architectural project at both micro and macro levels take place. The emphasis is on creating a link between the significance of architectural detail and the evolution of disciplinary and interdisciplinary knowledge and concepts within the framework of contemporary tectonic practice, through the development of a methodological-interpretive model. The paper delves into the poetic and technical aspects of architectural detail, investigating the conceptual underpinnings of architectural creation and the wider socio-cultural context of the inception, interpretation, and implementation of these concepts.
