The architecture of the medieval Serbian period, particularly that of the rulers' endowments, serves as a tangible testament to the adoption of the Byzantine and Eastern Christian cultural traditions. This adoption resulted in a unique fusion of classical and Hebrew thought, embodied in the doctrine of the Holy Trinity. Understanding this trinity principle is key to interpreting the architectural design of medieval churches.

The development of this doctrine and the exploration of the concept of God as a Trinity were influenced by significant Judaistic ideas and philosophical constructs from Late Antiquity. Tracking their adoption reveals progress in understanding the concept of one God as the Trinity, a concept that was already present in the teachings of the Cappadocian Fathers in the 4th century.

In the 6th century, the Corpus Areopagiticum, a significant theological and philosophical text, revealed and reconstructed a triadological image of the universe. This text demonstrated the division of theology into kataphatic, symbolic, and apophatic, and constructed a system of relationships among the celestial, ecclesiastical, and earthly hierarchies. This structure was accepted as a theoretical model for understanding the complex symbolic images of the Christian world.

To aid understanding, the concept of the Trinity is compared to the Borromean Rings or Knot, composed of three interlocking circles or loops. In this structure, the three rings represent the three Persons of the Trinity: the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, as well as the apophatic, symbolic, and kataphatic theology, and the celestial, ecclesiastical, and earthly hierarchy. At the center of all the circles is Unity, reflecting the unity in multiplicity. This principle of the Trinity aligns with the organic structure of Byzantine church architecture and the broader ecclesiastical world.

In studying this, the primary aspects of architecture - form, function, and structure - are considered. Each can be examined individually, but they are also inseparable, as they collectively complete architecture. The hypostases of the Trinity, God the Father, corresponds to the function in architecture. It is transcendental, perfect as a concept, but can only be manifested in a concrete form, which aligns with the revelation of God the Father through God the Son. The hypostasis of Christ corresponds to form in architecture. The existence of form is not viable if not pervaded by structure, just as without the Holy Spirit, there would not be God-Man.

By intertwining theology and architecture, a space for recognizing a triadological structure is created, which serves as a unifying factor in a vast field of semiotic meanings. Essentially, a theological concept designs an architectural space, so the principle of triadology is manifested through an act of creation.

However, any consideration of Christian architecture must address the question of sanctity. The concepts of sacredness or holiness are conceptually defined in the materialized figures of the Christian, Byzantine, and consequently Serbian culture. In the Eastern Christian tradition, the concept of sanctity is based on Biblical personalism, theocentrism, personal communion with God, and sanctification dependent on free will and God's grace. Sanctity is limitless, eternal divine existence. Christian philosophers interpret God's sanctity as three holy persons, so God is named (in ontological terms) as the Holy Trinity.

Understanding Eastern Christianity and consequently Serbian medieval church architecture in structuring the rulers' endowments as realms of sanctity in this world (materialization of Heaven on Earth), the Holy Trinity of the Old Testament played a significant role. The concept of the first three divisions of the Tabernacle influenced the sanctification of the Land of Hebrews, the city, the people. This process suggests a triadic relation between the ruling dynasty (the Josiah's lineage) - the Sanctuary (the place of the eternal Divine Presence) - Jerusalem (as a holy, celestial, eschatological city). Christian rulers, in accordance with theological postulates, sought to secure the sanctity of their position in the world, their states, their people, and the place of their eternal rest for future "sacred" existence among the "holy ones".

The Nemanjic's sacred lineage was established on this model, with the rulers building temples and monasteries as endowments and places of eternal rest. If possible, the ruler becomes a saint, aspiring to sanctify his nation and the state through his sanctified mediation to secure eternal salvation and life in the Heavenly Kingdom. This system manifests the kataphatic character of the God-chosen dynasty on earth, the symbolic character of the temple which abolishes the antinomy of the earthly, the created and the heavenly, the non-created with the apophatic character of the New Jerusalem heavenly existence.

Prince and Athos Mount monk, Sava Nemanjic, was a key architect of complex concepts in establishing the religious foundations of the Serbian medieval state and realizing the ideals of the sacred lineage dynasty. By building a cult of his father, Simeon Nemanjic, as a founder of the dynasty, a God-chosen ruler of a sacred ancestry, a monk, and finally a saint whose model had been Christ himself, St Sava formed a pattern for how future Serbian medieval rulers would conduct themselves and be celebrated. This pattern consisted of a triadic relation in a political system based on the relations between the church, the state, and the people. But the system becomes more complex as the sacred lineage develops, when an active ruler builds a Temple, a monastery, to subsequently leave the throne and assume an "image of a saint" by becoming a monk, so as to, in his future existence as a holy king and a mediator, secure a place in the Heavenly Kingdom for his nation. This established triadic model, a ruler - a monk - a saint, is understood as a ruler's personal relationship with the triune God, expressed in a life in a form of an existential movement from the earthly towards the heavenly, from the kataphatic via the symbolic towards the apophatic, from the secular via the monastic towards the sacred.

The Nemanjic rulers' ideological-theological program institutionalized the concept of sacredness, fully manifested in the architectural articulation of a monastic complex. Through special shaping, a relation was made between the hierarchical spatial design that supports the monastic way of life and the place where a "sacred king" resides. The spatial composition of a monastery and a church in its center and a monastic almost circular wall around it point to a symbolic image of the heavenly Jerusalem (itself being of circular shape), as the Serbian rulers envisaged the heavenly city on earth.

In defining the spatial relations within a circular enclosure of the sacred area, there is a paradigmatic principle consisting of three functional units: the place of liturgy - the church, the place of the prolonged liturgy - the refectory, the place of continuous prayer - the cell, the place of work. The relationship between the church, the refectory, and other structures, their mutual spatial interdependence was building a religious hierarchy, together constituting the supersensory sacred area. Only in its triadological simplicity, it would be possible to see the nature and the complete meaning of the Serbian medieval rulers' endowments.

The most significant medieval monastic complexes were valorized in the 20th century as cultural properties of outstanding value and many of them are now on the World Cultural and Natural Heritage List. In the historical process of valorization, the focus was always on the church, and only in the 20th century valid archaeological investigations of the monastic architecture started. In addition, the areas defined in that way were considered solely as archaeological sites. But the monastery of Djurdjevi Stupovi was the one that saw a transformation from the state of ruins to a live monastic complex. There have been, and still are, numerous discussions of how the religious heritage should be interpreted. Theoretical research of the monastic space conceptual sense confirms its complex triadological nature which bears a multitude of both tangible and intangible cultural and historical significations.

Such a correlation of the said semiotic, intangible values, and tangible traces constituted a basis for a project of limited restoration of the north-west buildings in the Sopocani monastic complex. The general idea was to implement all the knowledge that had been gathered through theoretical research of the religious area, and by protecting the entire architectural fabric, to make manifest a clear relationship with the historical and the structural, but also the religious features of the spatial complex.

Understanding the spatial definition of the temple and the monastic unit, its essence and its life, its history and the state of it as a cultural/spiritual property, the sacred attribute such an enclosure possesses, opens up a justifiable opportunity for a re-construction, a re-creation of a certain way of life. Furthermore, it is supported by a limited restoration of the monastic buildings architecture, demonstrating that by repeating something really inimitable can lead to unity based upon the indications of a specific topology of the past.
