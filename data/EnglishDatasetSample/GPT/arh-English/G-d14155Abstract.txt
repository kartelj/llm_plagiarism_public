The geodesic dome is part of a broader category of polyhedron dome-like structures. Its design includes a triangulated mesh of components, contributing to its rigidity and stability, along with its spherical shape. Conversely, a polyhedron dome-like structure with non-triangular sides can also be stable if it's constructed from surface structural elements or a structural arrangement of linear elements that give its sides a stable, non-deformable shape. This involves creating a stable structural system within the plane of the polyhedron dome sides. 

The structural system under consideration is composed of rigid components and flexible suspension rods arranged in two layers, separated by a span piece. Adjusting the length of the span piece pre-stresses the structural system, achieving the required rigidity and apparent stability. This structural system serves as a functional element that can be mass-produced, resulting in higher precision and quality in its production, making it a practical choice for dome construction. 

The transformation of its geometry further rationalises the use of functional elements in building polyhedron structures. Designing a polyhedron structure using functional elements necessitates the establishment of specific design principles and functional organisation. The geometry of the polyhedron dome-like structure can be created by replicating a polygon or a set of polygons around another polygon. Different shapes and combinations of these polygons can produce various polyhedron dome geometries. 

The generation of polyhedron dome geometries is facilitated by the study of existing knowledge in the field of form generation (Euclidean plane tessellation) and polyhedron systems with regular polygons. This lays the groundwork for further research and expansion of the classification of irregularly shaped polyhedron domes. The classification of polyhedron domes must meet not only geometric design principles but also static-constructive design principles, enhancing the planning process and realisation of efficient dome-like structures with optimal resource utilisation. 

Research findings indicate that a highly efficient polyhedron dome-like structure can be constructed from pre-stressed functional elements, with contour components made of wood. The primary benefits of such structures include low material consumption, a simple system of interconnected functional elements, independent determination of the level and span of dome-like structures, and the creation of supporting structures with simple geometry.
