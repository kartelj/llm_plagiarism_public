The study in question is a scientific exploration of residential architecture in Vojvodina, focusing on palaces and villas designed in the Art Nouveau style from the late 19th century to the onset of World War I. The introduction outlines the study's objectives, research methods, and initial hypotheses. The study provides a thorough analysis of the artistic, cultural, and sociological factors that led to the rise of a strong middle class, who were the primary investors in Vojvodina's residential architecture during this period. The study also examines the influence of this middle class on the development of residential architecture.

The research aims to provide a detailed examination of the architecture of residential buildings, palaces, and villas built in Vojvodina from the emergence of Art Nouveau in the late 19th century to its decline in 1914. The introduction presents initial hypotheses about the timing of the secession in Vojvodina, the blending of stylistic influences from major centers and local communities, the impact of various ethnic groups and individual investors on architecture, and the contribution of residential buildings and villas to the urbanization process in the early 20th century.

The second chapter, titled "The historical and social conditions in Europe and Vojvodina in the late 19th and early 20th century and the emergence of new architectural expression," begins with a brief overview of European society at the turn of the century, highlighting major changes in various aspects of life. Special emphasis is placed on the period of fin-de-siecle Vienna, as it had the greatest impact on the region of Vojvodina.

The third chapter, "The characteristics and location of residential villas and palaces in urban structure," explains the origin of the terms "palace" and "villa" and interprets their meaning through various historical periods. The fourth chapter, "Residential palaces built at the end of the 19th century, which anticipated new architectural expression," provides general characteristics of the residential architecture of that period.

The fifth chapter, "Residential buildings and villas in Vojvodina, in the spirit of Art Nouveau 1900-1914," presents general characteristics of residential architecture at the beginning of the 20th century. The most significant examples are divided into four groups.

The conclusion confirms initial hypotheses about the timing of the new style and the strong influence of the big metropolis and local traditions, the influence of investors from different ethnic groups, and the influence of Art Nouveau residential palaces on the development of architecture and settlements in Vojvodina. The study aims to contribute to a better understanding of architecture at the turn of the century in Vojvodina as part of the architectural heritage of Middle Europe and Europe as a whole.
