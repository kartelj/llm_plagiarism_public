The primary objective of this research is to reevaluate the concept of 'the good' and reaffirm its integral role in planning. The initial hypothesis suggests that 'the good' forms the foundation of planning as an ethical activity, implying that without the belief that planning can enhance city development, the necessity for planning would cease to exist. Given the importance of 'the good' in planning, it is anticipated to hold a pivotal role in the scientific discourse surrounding the nature and function of planning in the modern context. This belief underscores the importance of analyzing theoretical thought as a basis for model formation through a comprehensive literature review. The variety of theoretical perspectives is thought to impact the formation of a normative basis for action in practice and facilitate the identification of aspects that guide value judgment about 'the good' in city development practice. These components constitute the logical structure of the model, which will be utilized in the examination of specific case studies in Belgrade to validate the model and identify locally specific conditions. Consequently, the primary anticipated outcome of the research is the enhancement of theoretical knowledge and the development of a value-based judgment model, thereby establishing a framework for legitimacy in city development decision-making. The practical application of the developed model is twofold. Firstly, the conceptual model should help uphold the legitimacy of planning and challenge the basis for defining the regulatory framework. Secondly, it should aid in the development of new evaluation methods for planning processes and products. The research should enhance expert reasoning and increase awareness among planners and researchers about the significance of 'the good', thereby improving the overall status of planners in society and a wider social understanding.
