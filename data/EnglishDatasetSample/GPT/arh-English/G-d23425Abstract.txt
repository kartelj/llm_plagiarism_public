This study explores the energy characteristics of parametrically designed facades for office buildings under Belgrade's climatic conditions. The facade's design was determined by an algorithm developed in Dynamo, a visual programming software. Data from this algorithm is utilized by Project Refinery to analyze solutions with varying sizes and distributions of openings on the facade, using predefined fitness functions (direct sunlight illumination) and a metaheuristic optimization method - the genetic algorithm. After evaluating the results, the most efficient solution was selected and enhanced by incorporating shades, with their variable length determined by another optimization using a genetic algorithm for similar fitness functions. The outcomes of all optimizations were used to develop seven hypothetical models with real-world attributes in the BIM software Revit. All models underwent energy simulations on the cloud-based platform Green Building Studio, and the results were compared. The primary objective was to identify the most optimal facade design for an office building under Belgrade's climate conditions. The methodology includes facade optimization using a genetic algorithm, creation of hypothetical models, numerical simulation of their energy performance, results analysis, and ranking of the solutions based on their energy characteristics.
