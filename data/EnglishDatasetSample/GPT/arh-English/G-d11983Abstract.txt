The research aims to ascertain the proportion of embodied to operational energy throughout the lifespan of a family home that has undergone energy performance enhancements. A model was developed and implemented to estimate the life cycle energy of a typical family home in Sombor, Serbia. This model comprises five sub-models, each with mathematical equations and input-output inventories. Initial, recurring, and demolition energy data were sourced from the Ecoinvent database. The Passive House Planning Package - PHPP software was used to calculate the operational energy before and after the improvements, introducing the concepts of initial and recurring operational energy. By integrating passive (thermal envelope improvement) and active (technical installations) energy-saving measures, various energy performance improvement stages for the reference family home were established. Three distinct improvement stages were chosen based on a comparative analysis of the recurring operational energy results of the reference home. The selection adhered to national regulations (minimum requirements for existing homes), the optional standard - passive house (ger. Passivhaus), and the EU Regulation (nearly zero energy building - NZEB). The life cycle energy estimate model was applied to twelve versions of the reference family home, both pre and post energy performance improvements. The home's anticipated lifespan is 100 years, with improvements made at 30, 40, and 50-year intervals post-construction. The research outcomes include the life cycle energy estimate model for homes that have undergone energy performance enhancements, and the embodied to operational energy ratio of a typical Sombor home. Additionally, the embodied energy required to meet selected energy efficiency V requirements and the resulting operational energy savings of all analysed reference family home variants suggest that future Serbian building improvements should consider life cycle energy in primary energy units. The research highlights the need for standardised measurement and the inclusion of embodied energy as an energy efficiency indicator in regulations.
