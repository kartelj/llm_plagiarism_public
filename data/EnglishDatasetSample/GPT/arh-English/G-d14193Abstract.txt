The integration of design and architectural realization in today's world cannot be separated from the rise of architecture based on digital technology. This technology has primarily influenced architectural presentation and has gradually become a design tool directly linked to realization, establishing a "digital gap" between design and architectural realization through various digital techniques. This relationship between design and realization is increasingly embodied in CAD/CAM technology and is often studied as a "digital chain" principle. 

The term "digital chain" was first defined and explored at the CAAD department at ETH Zurich, where the candidate has already conducted initial research, collecting materials, establishing a glossary of terms, and cataloguing reference points. Today, digital tools are essential and active, while the architect's role seems passive and unclear. 

The evolution of digital technology in architecture over the past two decades provides a clearer understanding and opportunity to study the architect's role in the architectural approach based on the "digital chain" principle. The positioning of an architect in the design and architectural realization based on this principle is a continuous, evolving process that mirrors architectural development. 

The research aims to establish a precise, complex, and specific design process based on the properties of different materials, leading to a limited series of automated architectural realizations. The goal of this dissertation is to determine the current and future role of the architect in the architectural process based on the "digital chain" principle, focusing on innovative and thoughtful architectural design solutions. 

The "digital chain" principle presents new challenges in architectural theory, practice, and methodology. The methodological approach to this work aims to establish a strategy for the architect's global role in emerging architecture, proving and implementing its characteristics as a necessary part of the process. 

The first two chapters provide the theoretical basis for the topic. The second part of the dissertation is a qualitative study of different "digital chains" using CNC machines, with examples of serious architectural design requirements and meaningful architecture. The third part compares the "digital chain" process with the standard architectural principle, based on the conclusions of the previous research. 

The results show that the continuity of the "digital chain" is dependent on the existence of necessary architect's characteristics in the design and architectural realization based on the "digital chain" principle. This demonstrates the need for a redefinition of the architectural process by introducing new architect's activities for the efficiency of the whole process. 

The scientific justification of this work lies in the necessity and universality of theoretical research in the field of architectural design from the aspect of architecture and technology. The global conclusion is the proven need for a redefinition of the standard educational architectural system with the expansion of the digital design approach and architectural realization domain for the education and improvement of future architects in the technological circumstances and the emerging architecture atmosphere.
