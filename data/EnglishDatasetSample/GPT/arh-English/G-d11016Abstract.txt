During the 19th and early 20th centuries, a variety of vernacular architectural structures were constructed in the Stara Planina mountain region. These structures, now considered a part of Serbian cultural and artistic heritage, were adorned with unique decorative elements, reflecting the people's desire to beautify their living spaces. This doctoral dissertation aims to explore and analyze these decorative elements, focusing on their cultural, historical, ethnographic, and arts-and-crafts significance. 

The research for this dissertation was conducted over a five-year period, during which the architecture of 37 mountain villages in the Pirot District and the cities of Pirot and Dimitrovgrad was surveyed and analyzed. Detailed analytical and comparative methods were used to classify and define the basic types of decorative elements based on their form, origin, construction techniques, and material. These elements were then compared with those found in the wider Stara Planina region in Serbia and Bulgaria.

The traditional architecture of the Stara Planina villages preserves a unique and authentic tradition that reflects the historical quality of life and the spirit of past times. This architecture is characterized by traditional construction systems, infills, roof eaves, roof structures, bolsters, pillars, porches, chimneys, fireplaces, and other elements, all constructed using techniques adapted to natural materials. 

Authentic houses, rich in decorations, can be found in several villages, including Šugrin, Rsovci, Ragodeš, Kamenica, Slavinje, Visočki Odorovci, and Smilovci. Even less decorated villages like Pakleštica, Gostuša, and Orlja are unique due to their overall traditional expression. This heritage was created by folk builders and the skills of dunđeri, which were passed down through migrant work.

Migrant work in the Stara Planina area is a result of specific economic and migrant movements caused by an underdeveloped economy, unbalanced economic development, and turbulent social events in the 18th, 19th, and early 20th centuries. The local population engaged in various types of migrant work to meet their basic needs or acquire new property. Most of these migrant workers were builders, working in surrounding areas towards Bulgaria, Šumadija, and, to some extent, Romania, until the start of World War II.

The decline of tradition in the Stara Planina area is primarily due to large-scale migrations of the rural population to cities. The villages are now largely deserted, with a dwindling aging population, and their houses and other structures are in a state of ruin and dilapidation.
