The study explored various planar curves and surfaces, which are created as points with a constant sum/product of distances to the focus. It was discovered that there are geometric forms that are points with a constant sum/product of distances to the directrix. This creation process allowed for a link to be made between focal and directorial geometric forms with Palladio’s proportional system and Fermat-Weber’s set of points, also known as Weber’s location problem. Further analysis of these elements revealed their connections with certain geometric polygonal inequalities, leading to the introduction of a transitional element type, referred to as the focal-directorial generated element (focal-directorial curve and focal-directorial surface). 

The dissertation began with a generalization of the transitional type of planar curves with a constant sum of distances, defining Weber’s focal-directorial curve. A transitional type of curves with a constant product was introduced as Weber’s focal-directorial curve of Cassini’s type. In 3-D space, the curves were generated based on three geometric terms (point – focus; line – directrix line and plane – directorial plane). This combination resulted in transitional types of surfaces with constant sums of distances, known as Weber’s focal-directorial surface and Weber’s directorial-directorial surface. Transitional types of surfaces with constant product of distances were defined similarly and referred to with the same terminology, but noted as being of Cassini’s type. Weber’s surface and Weber’s surface of Cassini’s type are terms used for surfaces generated using all three geometric terms. All 3D elements created in this manner were graphically illustrated (three orthogonal projections and axonometric representation). 

The manuscript analyzes certain forms of focal-directory geometric forms in relation to their initial parameters. It also examines the geometric properties and order of 2D and 3D elements created in this manner. These elements were categorized and a classification diagram is included.
