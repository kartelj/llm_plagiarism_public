The doctoral dissertation research aimed to establish a methodology for creating a comprehensive environmental assessment system for individual houses in Belgrade. Initially, a general model for environmental assessment was formed. Later, three distinct models were developed for new, renovated, and existing houses, based on the unique characteristics of Belgrade's housing sector. The model structure comprises categories, subcategories, and criteria (the most specific elements) of environmental assessment. 

The environmental impacts of individual houses were identified as the most crucial factor in determining the categories (primary areas of environmental assessment). The content of these categories was influenced by Belgrade's characteristics, existing local and international legislation, other sources, and internationally developed models. All established criteria were divided into prerequisites and voluntary measures, each carrying a certain number of ecological points. 

The total number of ecological points is calculated by adding up the points from the criteria, subcategories, and categories. A minimum threshold was set, below which a house cannot be considered environmentally sound. Above this threshold, houses are classified into three levels of environmental quality based on the total ecological points obtained. The house in the optimal position regarding the environment (with minimal flows to and from nature) will receive the maximum number of ecological points. 

The ideal combination of measures relevant to Belgrade and the type of individual houses was determined. The defined model structure and assessment methodology paved the way for the development of an electronic tool in the EXCEL computer program, adding practical value to the model. The tool was tested on existing individual houses in Belgrade, confirming the model's functionality and the accuracy of the results. 

The general model's structure, from which the three separate models were later derived, was created in segments. This allowed for simplified variant separation and, more importantly, the integration of the life cycle with environmental assessment criteria. The identification of factors influencing the environmental assessment model structure, as demonstrated in this doctoral dissertation, is crucial for creating environmental assessment models for other building types and areas, guiding future research in the field.
