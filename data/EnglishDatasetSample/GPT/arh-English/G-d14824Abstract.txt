The doctoral thesis explores the characteristics and properties of architectural communication, proposing it as a potential model for interpreting the meaning and experience of architectural works. Contemporary architectural theory has shifted its focus from viewing architecture as a finished physical form to considering it as a space of complex communication, involving flows and interactions. This shift necessitates a new research approach, focusing on the analysis of the communicative capacity and forms of architecture. 

Architectural communication is manifested physically through matter, but it is also a product of human cognition and spirit. In this context, it can be seen as a form of intangible architecture. One of the thesis's goals is to elevate architecture as a field of thought that realizes communicative values, thereby reinforcing its status as an artistic and creative discipline. 

The research will explore two aspects of architectural communication: interior and exterior forms. Interior forms of communication refer to the subjective experience of interacting closely with architectural space. This form of communication is associated with the phenomenological research method, which emphasizes the exploration of sensory phenomena, subjective experiences, and the perception of space-time. 

Exterior forms of communication, on the other hand, relate to the broader context and culture in which a work is created and understood. This form of communication is linked to the principles of representation in architecture, where the architectural language itself is seen as a source of meaning. This connection leads to a close relationship with linguistic analogy, allowing for the interpretation of architecture in a symbolic sense using mimetic mechanisms and metaphor. 

The research will be divided into two parts: the first part will establish the theoretical framework for studying architectural communication, while the second part will conduct qualitative research using case studies of works by architect Zlatko Ugljen. The research methods used will contribute to social and methodological scientific knowledge. The research's application will be seen in its potential to provide a theoretical foundation for critical analysis and interpretation of architectural works, as well as a methodological approach to architectural design.
