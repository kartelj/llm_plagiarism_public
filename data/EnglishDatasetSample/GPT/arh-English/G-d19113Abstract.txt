This thesis explores the connection between Serbia's vernacular architecture and its interpretation during the 19th and 20th centuries. Previous studies on Serbian vernacular architecture have primarily focused on its formal elements and national identity. Consequently, this thesis aims to analyze Serbian vernacular architecture within the broader context of vernacular architecture as a whole, and its interpretation during the 19th and 20th centuries. The ultimate goal of this analysis is to provide an overview of its framework and to understand Serbian vernacular architecture, vernacular architecture in general, and the impact of 19th and 20th century interpretations on the vernacular architecture of that era. The primary hypothesis of this paper suggests that the interpretations of the observed period contributed to the gradual decline of vernacular building practices. Conversely, this thesis also investigates the potential and feasibility of incorporating certain values and principles of vernacular creativity into modern architectural theory and practice.
