The reconstruction of Užice was undertaken in a multifaceted and dynamic socio-economic, political, professional, and artistic environment. The historical analysis of this period reveals a societal shift post-1950, when the concept of proletarian dictatorship was replaced with social equality and justice. This change influenced the idea of the city centre's manifestation square, which was expanded to include a social centre, encompassing social, cultural, commercial, business, and entertainment elements. 

The reconstruction of Titovo Užice holds special significance as the city was the centre of 'The Užice Republic', the first liberated territory in occupied Europe, for 73 days from September 24 to November 29, 1941. The political backdrop facilitated the successful creation of a city square that served both memorial and daily functions. 

In 1952, a competition was held for the best design of the Square and the central city blocks. The competition saw two contrasting concepts for the city centre's reconstruction. One winning design proposed a more compact urbanism with clear boundaries between blocks and open spaces. The other winning design advocated for an avant-garde and open space. Both designs were awarded the first prize due to their merits. 

The final Square was a result of significant compromise, but it fulfilled the program requirements for a new social centre. The design work for the Square began in 1949, with construction starting in 1957. The central area of the Square, featuring a monument to Marshal Tito, was completed in 1961. Additional construction on the Square continued until 2001, making the total duration of the Square's documentation and construction 52 years. 

Today, the Square continues to function as the central public space, but its intended purpose was much broader. It was meant to regulate the city's spatial composition and functions as an urban-architectural unit. This was outlined in the General Urban Regulation Plan for Titovo Uzice. However, changes in traffic designs and the failure to implement building activities according to the adopted vertical urban regulations, density, and planned building activities in the downtown area have disrupted this goal. As a result, the essential purpose of the Partisan Square has been lost.
