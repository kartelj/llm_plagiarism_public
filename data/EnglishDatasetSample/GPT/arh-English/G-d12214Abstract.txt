The doctoral dissertation primarily explores the potential for enhancing the methodology used in spatial development planning for public services in Serbia. The motivation for this topic was derived from the need to enhance the theoretical foundation of public service planning and contribute to better planning practices, as identified through previous research and understanding of issues in the public service sector. 

The rapid development in today's world, particularly in transitioning countries like Serbia, necessitates changes in the public service sector and its spatial development planning. This includes the exploration of new or adjusted working patterns. Despite the existence of widely accepted principles based on theoretical research and international documents, there are no universal patterns that can be easily adapted to practice. Hence, reviewing and redefining contextually specific methodological tools remains a challenging research task. 

For a long time, public service planning in Serbia has been marked by an inadequate, contradictory, and incomplete development framework. This framework is caught between the abandoned normative model of planning public services in a planned economy and the neo-liberal, market-oriented model of the economy, with its privatization and deregulation processes and the disintegration of the public services system. 

The issues are particularly noticeable at the local, primary level of public services, characterized by size, density, dispersion in the territory, and uneven spatial distribution. The partially centralized system for planning and financing public services at the national level is collapsing due to inadequate policies, undefined goals, and criteria for spatial development. There is also a problem of spatial insensitivity in this domain, as well as poor inclusion of spatial and physical aspects of planning and other important influencing factors. 

Given the current state of planning and development of public services in Serbia, it is challenging to identify a long-term policy for their physical development. Therefore, changes to the existing planning model are necessary, including a viable, flexible approach to planning that ensures adaptation to local and regional characteristics of the planned area. 

The research primarily focuses on changing the pattern and method of public services planning, considering the context of social sustainability, civil rights, equality, justice, and social cohesion, and the practice of public services planning globally and in Serbia. 

New trends in urban planning, such as sustainable planning, and market conditions that influence the development of cities and territories in Serbia, direct research towards locally specific results. Previous studies have shown limited or no possibility of transferring European and other experiences in sustainable planning implementation, considering the economic, social, political, and spatial legacy of Serbian cities. 

The doctoral thesis's scientific contribution is defining the possibilities of implementing sustainable development principles based on an integrated approach to establish a connection to the chosen set of values, considering the transitional conditions. 

The research focuses on selecting methodological tools and defining criteria and indicators for the operationalization of the presented theoretical assumptions and principles of spatial development planning of public services. It also focuses on defining an improved planning model, harmonized with urban/regional planning practice in Serbia. The results should reflect the local characteristics of the planning territory, making it unique in defining the planning strategy and development concept. Their implementation is demonstrated within given case studies of the specified research areas in different parts of Serbia.
