This research aims to enhance architectural workflow by gaining a deeper understanding of the role of adaptive principles in the creation and production of architectural models. The term "Adaptive Architecture" is currently used to define any built environment specifically designed to adapt to the needs of its users and the environmental climate conditions. This often involves the use of digital technology, including sensors, actuators, and controllers. 

This research focuses on the role of adaptive principles in architectural design, with an emphasis on improving the performance of the built space and energy efficiency. However, it approaches this from a unique perspective, one that precedes the use of innovative technologies in the construction industry. The research will contribute to the development of new design strategies and tools that necessitate the use of advanced technical solutions. 

The understanding of adaptive principles is not limited to the use of building technology that allows for physical space transformation, but it also includes the ability of the built environment to evolve over time. The research examines the role of adaptive phenomena, primarily related to the conception of complex spatial organizations, structures, and environments. It suggests adaptations throughout the design process rather than transformation of the built environment. 

The research is divided into two distinct parts. The first is theoretical, based on logical argumentation, and provides an overview of three distinct but complementary ways of modeling in architecture: analogue, performative, and prototypical. The second part is based on research by design, documenting the process of conception and production of a series of prototypical models. This part of the research is experimental and combines research with educational work. 

The research is supported by a series of design workshops involving approximately eighty students from the Faculty of Architecture, University of Belgrade, the Visiting Programme of the Architectural Association, London, and several other architecture schools. The research by design begins with two theoretical models, each suggesting the emergence of organizational patterns not based on geometric and centrally controlled schemes, but on the internal and changing relations between their constitutive elements. 

The interpretation of both theoretical models, the “Field” (Allen, 1997) and the “Network” (Wigley, 2001), has led to research on designing such complex and changing spatial organizations. It is suggested that adaptive principles could be crucial for many design tools, enabling architects to understand and utilize such concepts. The outcome is a strategy for designing spatial organizations and structures with the ability for continuous growth and self-regulation in response to changing environmental conditions.
