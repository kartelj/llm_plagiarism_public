The dissertation presented is a theoretical exploration of the academic work of architect Đorđe Petrović, with a focus on the discourse of integrity and autonomy in architectural drawing. The analysis is framed by Petrović’s scientific and educational contributions to the Faculty of Architecture at the University of Belgrade, specifically in the field of architectural drawing from 1959 to 1975. His research in futuristic and visionary architecture and Space art, conducted during his time in Canada from 1976 to 1989, also informs the analysis. The early 1970s, when the New School concept was formed at the Faculty of Architecture in Belgrade and Petrović introduced visual research and visual communications into the educational and theoretical framework, serves as the starting point for the analysis. This period saw a reevaluation of architectural drawing as more than just a technical tool. The main issue, according to the interpretation of Petrović’s interdisciplinary academic work, is defining the characteristics of integrity in architectural drawing through the principles of aesthetics of structural forms, visual research of the human environment, and spatial representation. The concept of the integral nature of architectural drawing is assessed in relation to the socio-cultural context of the time and the practices that preceded it. The thesis aims to establish how integral architectural drawing can be implemented in scientific, creative, and educational activities.
