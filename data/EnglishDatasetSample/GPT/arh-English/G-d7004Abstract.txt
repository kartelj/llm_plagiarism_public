As humanity has advanced throughout history, particularly in the creation of material goods and the humanization of relationships, the tools and methods of destruction and violence have perhaps developed even more intensely. These destructive forces have compelled people to invest heavily in comprehensive safety and defense systems for their protection. Consequently, the list of potential and actual threats continues to grow daily, with new dangers surpassing previous ones in terms of potential impact and devastation. These threats include those that arise or could arise during times of war or peace. 

Primarily due to the vast global financial investment in the arms race, most scientific inventions are initially used for military purposes. This undoubtedly has an indirect impact on the development of cities, which are the centers of government, administration, management, and wealth. 

In terms of the physical layout of cities, it is believed that various technologies - including those related to work, production, military, transportation, communication, and communal infrastructure - form the fundamental links between engineering, technology, and the physical structure of a city. 

The growth of cities cannot be considered outside of their historical context, which includes factors such as the level of development of production and military engineering, methods of warfare, political and military alliances, socio-economic environment, and architectural and urban planning concepts. Therefore, historical analysis is a key feature of research in all these areas. 

Three key historical events have significantly influenced urban planning and the growth and shape of cities: the invention and use of conventional firearms up to the end of World War II; the invention and use of nuclear weapons up to the end of the 20th century; and the invention and use of space technology with highly destructive and accurate weapons, such as remote action, 'smart fire-bombs', cruise missiles, and laser weapons. 

Based on the available research, it can be concluded that cities and military technologies or warfare techniques are closely linked. Historically, it was impossible to conceive of a city without visible defensive power. The conquest of cities was synonymous with the conquest of the world and nations. Therefore, the history of cities could also be viewed as a history of defense and attack.
