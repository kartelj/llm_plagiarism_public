The concept of landscapes as inherently representative of human society first emerged in Western civilization during the early Renaissance. A geographical discourse explaining the interplay between human society and its environment appeared in the late eighteenth century. In his 1925 essay “The Morphology of Landscape”, Carl Ortwin Sauer defined cultural landscape as the outcome of a culture's actions on nature. According to Sauer, cultural landscape arises from the evolution of a culture in a specific space, or the replacement of one culture with another. The study of landscape was primarily confined to geographical discourse until the late 1970s, but since then, significant studies have emerged in the fields of architecture and urban studies.

This PhD thesis broadly explores the urban history of Belgrade in the nineteenth century, from the final decade of the eighteenth century to the First World War. The last quarter of the century saw a qualitative leap in urban development, with the introduction of infrastructure systems such as electric street lighting, a modern water and waste management system, and electric trams. The thesis focuses on the architectural and urban transformation of Belgrade during this period.

The research questions are divided into several basic groups, including the actors of change, the area that underwent transformation, and the characteristics of the transformational processes. The primary goal is to analyze the causal factors of Belgrade's transformation in the nineteenth century, examining architectural and urban spatial aspects within the larger context of shifting dominant cultures and social structures.

The nineteenth-century social makeup of Belgrade was significantly different from the late eighteenth century, comprising three main groups: Serbs from the Principality of Serbia and other parts of the Ottoman Empire, Serbs from the Habsburg Empire, and representatives of the long-standing mercantile and artisanal community of Belgrade. These three groups formed a new amalgamated city culture reflecting the political upheaval in Belgrade and Serbia.

The transformation period can be divided into several phases, with the first phase from 1791 to 1815 showing the first signs of transformation. The second phase lasted until 1867, and the third phase continued until the First World War. The study examines the transformation of Belgrade’s urban landscape through various architectural and urban spatial indicators of change.

The research is based on Henri Lefebvre's unitary theory and science of space, as well as Edward W. Soja’s insights regarding third space. The narrower theoretical framework of the dissertation includes considerations of various aspects of perceiving and constructing the complex phenomenon of the landscape, including urban landscape.

The research shows that Belgrade's urban landscape underwent a transformation in the nineteenth century, largely driven by the paradigm of the modern European city. The transformation also occurred in the field of architectural and urban culture, characterized by the creation of a new “lived”, third space. The thesis raises questions about the significance of cultural practices in space during the transformation of an urban landscape from an Ottoman to a European or capitalist city.
