Through a distinct understanding of both the immediate and the transcendent reality, architectural reality presents a singular aspect of the fictional world. This is because it straddles the line between reality and unreality, with its imagined realities being both consciously and unconsciously conceived. These imagined realities embody the designer's fictional and dreamlike reality within the transcendent reality, and a unique, existing, and innovative architectural reality within the immediate one. This only occurs when a Designer, during the design process, utilizes the dreamlike fiction of architecture in a project that transcends reality. By dreaming within these transcendent, fictional, and dreamlike realities, and then transitioning into a New Reality, the Designer becomes a unique consciousness, a singular subject of the fiction who designs through a combination of imagination, dreamlike and creative imagination of the dreamy fiction world of a dream of the architectural design's fictional and dreamlike entity. When the dreamlike fiction of architecture in the project that transcends reality is utilized by its new fiction in the project within reality, a dreamy fiction world of the dream becomes his architectural dream of the project of reality of the same, but a New Reality.
