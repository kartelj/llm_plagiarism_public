The unpredictable circumstances and dynamic changes pose a significant challenge to the sustainable development of modern cities. Climate change, largely attributed to human activities such as the use of fossil fuels and greenhouse gas emissions, is a major contributor to these conditions. Cities, home to the majority of the world's population, are not only the primary sources of climate change but also bear the brunt of its effects. This thesis primarily focuses on the resilience of cities, i.e., their ability to withstand unpredictable impacts like climate change while preserving their core identity, structures, processes, and sustainable development. Cities are viewed in this study as complex socio-ecological systems characterized by uncertainty, self-organization, and spatial extension, operating on a "top-down" principle. The "ecology of city" framework will consider the urban form, a result of human adaptation to the natural environment, alongside other physical system components and social processes. The study will examine the impacts of different urban patterns on urban system processes and performance, and their significance to overall urban system resilience, particularly in relation to climate change. The urban form, reflecting the values of a specific socio-economic system and its environmental relationship, is a "product" of a particular urban design model. These models exhibit diverse relationships between artificial and natural system components, resulting in varied built landscape characteristics. The thesis aims to determine how a specific urban design model (and the resulting urban form) influences the resilience of the socio-ecological system. Using morphological, environmental, and social criteria, the primary goal is to assess the resilience of certain urban form patterns to climate change and explore urban design approaches that could enhance it.
