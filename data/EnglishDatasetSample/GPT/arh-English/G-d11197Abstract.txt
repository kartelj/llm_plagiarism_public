This doctoral dissertation delves into the modern manifestation of the architectural model phenomenon, examined through a phenomenological lens. The aim is twofold: to underscore the significance and role of models in shaping modern architecture, and concurrently, to emphasize the necessity of acknowledging phenomenology in the realm of modern architectural education. 

To fulfill these objectives, the study concentrates on three main areas: (1) the concept of contemporariness, (2) the fluid connection between phenomenology and architecture, and (3) the structural examination of the architectural model as an object. The theoretical framework is supported by experimental project-models, which serve as an investigative tool in architecture for studying autonomy identity, the origin of form, and the meaning of purpose. These are demonstrated through student exercises at the Belgrade Faculty of Architecture. 

The dissertation also offers insights on the application of models in architecture.
