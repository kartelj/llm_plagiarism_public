The villages on Šar Mountain are known for their rich cultural and historical monuments, spanning various eras of human civilization. This heritage is evident in the stunning natural landscapes, old town and village complexes, and monumental architecture. Prizren, often referred to as the "town-museum", is a treasure trove of cultural heritage and a shining example of traditional architecture. Tetovo, located on the other side of Šar Mountain, shares many similarities with Prizren. 

The architecture of the urban areas reflects oriental influences, while the villages on Šar Mountain maintain the authentic architecture of the Serbian population that has lived there for centuries. Šar Mountain is a true architectural and ethnological park, bearing witness to historical evolution and continuity of life. 

Within this park, one can find unique architectural forms. These forms, crafted by the skilled masons of Sredačka župa using locally sourced materials, are shaped by the climate and social conditions, always maintaining a distinct and recognizable character. The old house complexes, set against the natural landscape, create an almost surreal "small town" atmosphere, showcasing the craftsmanship of the artisans who built not only in their own villages, but also the Arbanas towers, from Prizren to Romania, and even as far as the United States. 

Traditional construction in the Šar Mountain villages peaked at the turn of the 19th to 20th century, particularly evident in the residential buildings with their unique structure and indigenous architectural form. The emergence of artisans also played a significant role in shaping this unique architecture. 

The architecture of the Šar Mountain villages is a testament to both the indigenous environmental characteristics and the skill of its masons. It is hoped that this aspect of architectural heritage will garner interest from the scientific and professional community, aiding in a more comprehensive understanding of the research area and informing future architectural studies.
