This doctoral thesis is a theoretical exploration of the intersection between contemporary design practices and their phenomenological interpretation, using the concept of a space's atmosphere. The dissertation focuses on defining the concept of architectural atmosphere, examining it through the lens of environmental art practice and analyzing it through the study of everyday spaces in the designs of architect Vasilije Milunović. 

The primary aim of the research is to establish a practical link between environmental art practices and architectural design, with the goal of expanding architectural design practice to include the critical and research potentials of interdisciplinary and hybrid practices in artistic creation. The value of these established connections lies in the potential for interdisciplinary exchange of research tactics and techniques, as well as the potential for enhancing design practice by expanding the scope and media of research and work.

The research's operational goal, in the context of architectural work, is to highlight the value of studying a broad spectrum of human behavior in everyday life, ranging from everyday performances, rituals and routines, to forms of performance. The research assumes that architecture is a structural system of symbols in complex communicational and phenomenological constructs, as well as a multimedia textual phenomenon, which occurs in time intervals of constituting the individual and collective everyday.

The research is predominantly phenomenological (hermeneutic and interpretative), conducted as qualitative interpretative research. This type of research involves the researchers in the problem and the subject of research. In this case, the author plays a dual role: as chronicler and actors of the event, which is a unique role and thus suitable for qualitative research.

The study begins by establishing a theoretical framework, followed by an analysis of relevant concepts in architectural theory, environmental art theory, and everyday life theory. The final chapter of the theoretical study outlines the implications for the possibility of analyzing the ambiance of the quotidian.

The second part of the thesis is designed as qualitative research, consisting of four case studies in which previously proposed hypotheses are tested in real conditions. The concluding paragraphs provide an overview of the research results obtained.

Two methodological apparatuses were applied in relation to two parts of the research. The first, theoretical part of the research uses the method of analysis of sources and literature. Theoretical conclusions emerge through comparative analysis of primary materials offering the elements for defining criteria, which are the subject of the second part of the work. The second part of research uses a complex methodological system towards a better application of techniques, including collecting, systematizing of documentation and analysis of content related to the subject of research, architectural analysis of the design process of four selected case studies, simulation methods to study potentials of the architectural practice spread through the synthesis of related practices in the arts.

The theoretical framework is set through the examination and systematization of relevant theoretical approaches. The proposed hypotheses are verified through an analysis of relevant texts in the field of architectural phenomenological theory, the theory of environmental art and theory of everyday life. The concept of the architectural atmosphere is explained as a broader term in relation to the phenomenological model of heightened perception, as defined in the book Phenomenology of Perception (Phenomenologie de la perception, 1945) by Maurice Merleau–Ponty, and further developed by Juhani Pallasmaa in contemporary architectural theory.

Problems of experience in architecture are considered from the point of analysis of the importance of a multi–sensory experience in the field of architecture and the way we think about it, how we perceive space and the way in which we create a space (architecturally). The analysis of definition of the environment in the practices of environmental art by Allan Kaprow, Claes Oldenburg and Ilya Kabakov allowed for the identification of key aspects of possible applications of the practice of environmental art.

A theoretical interpretation of the subject of research (housing objects in Belgrade) is realized through the analysis of the schema that constitutes the phenomenological line of thought by Henri Lefebvre, and problematizes the idea of everyday practices and tactics, and the term "space" and "place" by Michel de Certeau. Set this way, the theoretical concept was examined through an analysis of key examples (representative case studies).

Analysis of the theory of multi– sensory experience and its role in the development of concepts is placed in focus of the research through architectural design. The starting point of the research of the design process is a preliminary overview of the overall authorial practice of architect Vasilije Milunović, professor at the Faculty of Architecture in Belgrade.

Case studies are examples for the analysis of the design process of everyday spaces in the projects for residential buildings in Belgrade, Republic of Serbia: conceptual design for a residential building on 23, Topolska street, municipality of Vračar, the conceptual design for a residential building on 10, Serdar Jola street, municipality of Stari Grad, conceptual design for a residential building on 9, Tolstojeva street, municipality of Savski Venac.

The possibility of application of the practice of environmental art in architecture is based on three basic characteristics that are the cornerstone for research of space: (1) the primacy of space in environmental arts, (2) focus on the spectator and his experience of space, (3) the possibility of interpreting scenes of everyday life through environmental art. These three characteristics of environmental practices are explored through examples of spaces in selected case studies.

An overview of the principal spatial atmospheres is offered, based on the analysis of case studies, which are then presented as everyday scenes and potential rituals of everyday life that could be "performed" and analyzed. Each case study provides the opportunity for the identification of a complex critical attitude towards the existing social quotidian.

What is shown this way is that contemporary architecture has design practices similar to practices of environmental art, and that an introduction of environmental art in architecture can enable the active role of architecture in the interdisciplinary field of artistic practice in contemporary culture, in order to expand the field of design techniques and strategies.

Evaluation of the results indicate the possibility that the concept of atmosphere in architecture can follow dynamic qualitative and quantitative changes of the social quotidian, its rituals and routines, and, that in this way, it can continuously improve responses of architectural practice to the needs of contemporary society and culture.

Justification of this work stems from the need for theoretical research in the field of architectural design and contemporary architecture, and the necessity for development of contemporary architectural design practice. The practical application of the results consists in the possibility of including architectural practices in interdisciplinary practice in the field of art, as well as the possibility of transformation and transfiguration of environmental art practices in architecture.

In a broader sense, the contribution of the research consists in analyzing and understanding the ways in which similar research areas adapt to ongoing changes of the research and cultural context. In a narrower sense, the work is a contribution to research in the field of architectural design.
