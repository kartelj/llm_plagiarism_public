The following thesis focuses on urban housing forms, specifically the spatial and physical patterns of structures in Belgrade's current production and distribution. The study examines the existing urban housing forms in Belgrade and explores potential for expansion and diversification. The term 'urban housing type' is used to describe the urban-morphological type of housing resulting from the planning process. The concept of urban housing type is explored through two research aspects: (1) the spatial and morphological features of the housing model, and (2) the planning process as a public activity that shapes it through creation and adoption. The study investigates existing housing types in Belgrade during the post-socialist political, social, and cultural transition and conditions for its diversification. The research is conducted on two parallel tracks. The first track examines the urban housing types as an urban-morphological phenomenon, defined by planning parameters that give them a specific form. These planning parameters are a product of operational planning practice under certain conditions, and they code physical structures and urban forms for different groups based on their specific spatial and other needs and preferences. The first hypothesis is based on the observed changes in urban structure during the post-socialist transition, focusing on the transformation of housing forms during this period. The second track of the research explores the role and maneuverability of planning in generating transitional urban housing types, and proposes a hypothesis about the limited potential of urban planning for diversifying their variety. The research context is the post-socialist social, political, and cultural transition that has shaped the last decades in Belgrade and Serbia, and the current range of housing forms were created during this period. The existing housing types are identified within detailed urban plans in transformation zones, recognized as standard for transitional cities. They are analyzed using the classical urban morphology methodology established by Conzen, with some adaptations. The role and scope of planning during the post-socialist transition also refers to experiences and theoretical research in other post-socialist environments. The final conclusions suggest possible directions for further research, as well as the theoretical and practical applicability of the results.
