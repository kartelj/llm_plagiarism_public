The aim of this thesis is to demonstrate and elucidate the potential for enhancing decision-making in the choice of the most economically viable bidder in public e-procurement. This choice relies on pre-set criteria that the buyer in public e-procurement determines. The choice is straightforward in scenarios with a few bidders and when there are established quantitative criteria for comparison. However, real-world situations often involve a large number of bidders, and the selection of the most suitable among them is based on both qualitative and quantitative criteria. The primary hypothesis in this thesis, which has been validated within the doctoral thesis framework, is that the application of multi-criteria decision-making methods and fuzzy set theory can enhance the selection of the most economically viable bidder in public e-procurement when both quantitative and qualitative criteria are used simultaneously. In such a selection process, it is feasible to ascertain the values linked to the output variable that corresponds to the weights of criteria belonging to a fuzzy set through defuzzification, i.e., choosing one output variable value with the same quantification. Concurrently, the thesis introduces a decision support system based on the multi-criteria decision-making concept and fuzzy set theory. This system is a crucial component of the public e-procurement web portal, facilitating the creation of a collaborative workspace that seamlessly integrates buyers and suppliers into a unified virtual e-procurement platform.
