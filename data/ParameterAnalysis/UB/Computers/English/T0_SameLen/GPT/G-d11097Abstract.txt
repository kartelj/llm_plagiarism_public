Market positioning is a concept that involves active engagement in shaping tourist offerings or services, giving tourism businesses the chance to secure an optimal market position. The initial positioning approach, which emerged in the 1970s, focused on a single company's promotional activities, with the main challenge for marketing professionals being to secure a unique place in consumers' minds through marketing efforts. Despite various authors interpreting and defining the positioning concept from different angles over time, no universal market coordinates have been established that can ensure an optimal, stable, and sustainable market position. As the positioning concept has evolved, the methods used to achieve positioning goals have varied, from multidimensional scaling to discriminant, factor, and Conjoint analysis. This dissertation suggests a new solution to market positioning problems, using a combination of statistical models and operational research models. This will allow marketing managers to respond promptly and develop market positioning strategies in a competitive environment. The proposed model offers the potential to anticipate competitors' moves, striking a balance between focusing on consumer preferences and competition, leading to a better formulation of the optimal market strategy. Conjoint analysis is used to assess consumer preferences, as it offers insight into market heterogeneity and the potential to determine the optimal features of a tourist product. In the case of heterogeneous preferences, market segmentation can be implemented using cluster analysis. However, considering the competitive nature of the modern market, all possible market interactions must be considered. This market conflict, which may seem chaotic, conceals rationalities that can be modeled using game theory concepts. The combined application of these three models (Conjoint analysis, cluster analysis, and game theory) offers a better way to determine the optimal market position than previous methods, which primarily used these models separately. The application and validity of this unique market positioning model are demonstrated by testing it on real-world gastronomy events. The proposed model's adaptability, flexibility, and potential for dynamic decision-making are particularly significant, as it can be reused in response to changes in market conditions, such as the launch of a new product, improvements to an existing product, or changes in consumer preferences, to achieve an optimal market position. In the future, this model could have wide-ranging applications in all sectors of tourism and the service sector, where it could serve as a general paradigm for determining the optimal market position.
