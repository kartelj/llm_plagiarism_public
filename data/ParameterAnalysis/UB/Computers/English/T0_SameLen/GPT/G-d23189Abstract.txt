Statistical methods in natural language processing often necessitate substantial quantities of labeled data and various auxiliary language tools, restricting their use in resource-scarce environments. This dissertation introduces a method for creating statistical strategies for semantic processing of natural languages with limited resources. In these languages, not only are existing language resources scarce, but the ability to create new datasets and dedicated tools and algorithms is also limited. The suggested method concentrates on short texts due to their ubiquity in digital communication and the increased complexity of their semantic processing. The method covers all stages in the development of statistical solutions, from text collection, data annotation, to the design, training, and assessment of machine learning models. Its application is demonstrated in depth on two semantic tasks â€“ sentiment analysis and semantic textual similarity. The Serbian language is used as an example of a language with limited resources, but the suggested method can also be applied to other languages in this category. Besides the general method, this dissertation's contributions include the creation of a new, adaptable short-text sentiment annotation system, a new annotation cost-effectiveness metric, and several new semantic textual similarity models. The dissertation results also comprise the creation of the first publicly accessible annotated datasets of short texts in Serbian for sentiment analysis and semantic textual similarity tasks, the development and assessment of numerous models on these tasks, and the first comparative assessment of multiple morphological normalization tools on short texts in Serbian.
