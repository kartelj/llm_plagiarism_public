The selection of a routing strategy in a packet network significantly influences the reliability and overall data transmission quality. The chosen strategy also affects the utilization of various network resources, and poor routing decisions can lead to network bottlenecks and limit throughput. Network latency and cost are also dependent on the selected routing scheme. To identify the optimal routing strategy for a specific network and anticipated traffic, routing optimization is conducted. The aim of routing optimization is to achieve the best possible value for the selected network performance metric. Depending on the problem at hand, optimization can be done to maximize network throughput, minimize network cost, reduce latency, etc.
In this study, we will tackle the issues of maximizing network throughput and minimizing network cost. We will concentrate on non-blocking networks, which ensure service to all users generating and receiving traffic within set boundaries, regardless of the current traffic distribution in the network. In this study, we will suggest a new routing scheme, based on load balancing and shortest path routing. We will refer to this scheme as load balanced routing (LBR). The proposed routing protocol can be optimized using linear programming to either minimize cost or maximize network throughput.
The suggested routing scheme can be easily implemented in practice. Specifically, shortest path routing is commonly used, and the proposed routing is a modification that can be relatively easily implemented. The dimension of the linear program is acceptable, as is the time required for optimization. With the proposed routing, it is possible to guarantee service to a larger number of users than with regular shortest path routing. Also, the cost of servicing a certain number of users is lower if the proposed routing is used instead of the shortest path routing.
Initially, we will present the proposed load balanced routing and the linear program for its optimization. We will then evaluate the performance of the proposed routing scheme and compare it to the performance of the shortest path routing. Specifically, we will focus on two scenarios. In the first, we will optimize the load balanced routing to achieve maximum network throughput. It will be demonstrated that the proposed load balanced routing can significantly enhance the guaranteed network throughput compared to regular shortest path routing. In the second scenario, we will optimize the load balanced routing to achieve the lowest possible network cost that can support given user demands. It will be demonstrated that the cost of the network with load balanced routing is lower than the cost of the network using shortest path routing.
We will conduct analysis for both regular and realistic network topologies. Additionally, we will analyze networks where service reliability is required in the event of a single resource (link or router) failure. It will be demonstrated that the performance of the proposed load balanced routing surpasses the performance of shortest path routing in all these scenarios.
