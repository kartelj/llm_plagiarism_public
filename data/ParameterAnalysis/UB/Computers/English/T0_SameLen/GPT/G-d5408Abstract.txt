E-learning is a multifaceted system encompassing distance education, lectures, and various electronic classroom materials; it involves both individual and group learning processes, tutoring, and interactive work. The rapid and significant growth in user numbers, services, educational content, and necessary resources presents new optimization challenges for educational institutions and their e-learning systems, along with the need for dynamic competitiveness and cost control. This results in increasingly complex requirements for the development and implementation of IT infrastructure for e-learning systems. By utilizing modern information and communication technologies, the efficiency, flexibility, and cost-effectiveness of e-learning systems can be enhanced. The introduction of IT infrastructure models for e-learning based on the modern IT concept of Cloud Computing can improve the reliability, scalability, and cost-effectiveness of educational processes. The lack of scientific support for the application of the Cloud Computing concept in modeling the IT infrastructure of higher education in the Republic of Serbia and the strategic importance of this concept highlight the need for theoretical support for its more efficient development and application. In this context, the dissertation research topic is presented, focusing on defining and developing plans and activities of higher education institutions related to the development of an IT infrastructure model for e-learning using the Cloud Computing concept. By exploring existing and seeking new ways to provide services to students and research staff, higher education institutions face numerous challenges, primarily related to digital identity and access management. The first and perhaps most significant challenge is to encourage the adoption and implementation of digital identity management systems. A successful IT infrastructure for digital identity management necessitates a systematic approach to identities and the interdependence between them. The second challenge is to provide support for a system capable of leveraging all the benefits of federation systems for digital identity management. The establishment of such federations among educational institutions facilitates user, content, and service mobility. The primary hypothesis formulated and validated within the doctoral thesis is that the application of a developed IT infrastructure model can enhance the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of e-learning systems. The experimental portion of the doctoral thesis consists of research aimed at validating the proposed IT infrastructure model for e-learning. The research was conducted in the E-Business Laboratory at the Faculty of Organizational Sciences. The research results demonstrated that the implemented IT infrastructure model made the e-learning system more efficient, flexible, and cost-effective.
