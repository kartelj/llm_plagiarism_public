The thesis research issue pertains to the vast quantity of data and the scarcity of information in business reporting systems' reports. Despite being filled with charts and tables, these reports only contain data (their graphical representations) and minimal or no information. Users of these reports must manually decipher this data (by reviewing various reports), which can lead to missing crucial information due to: data overload, exhaustion, lack of focus, insufficient knowledge or experience, subjectivity, or ill-intent. This paper suggests automating the process of converting data into information. The suggested method is grounded on the principle that data transforms into information when meaning (interpretation) is attached to it. Moreover, relevant (domain) knowledge is necessary to extract meaning from data. The suggested implementation of this method involves using expert system methods, techniques, and technologies to automate the interpretation of key performance indicators. Specifically, classes will represent declarative knowledge, and rules and fuzzy theory will represent procedural knowledge. Information can be derived through forward chaining and fuzzy inference, and then converted into natural language-like sentences using canned text. After assessing the current state of business intelligence systems and expert systems, the proposed method is thoroughly explained from a theoretical perspective. This is followed by a discussion on the (potential) pros and cons of the solution, and then the implementation plan. By showcasing the method with a prototype - PT application (PT - Enterprise Profit Interpretation Tutor), hypothesis testing and validation was made possible. The reports provided by the application contain data (in the form of graphics and tables) and also information (in the form of natural-language-like sentences). The evaluation involved a study where the subjects were students who used PT as a learning tool. The results indicate that students find PT useful and relatively simple to use. The explanations in the reports are deemed useful and easy to comprehend, but need to be more extensive. The majority of the students surveyed believe that using the PT application somewhat enhances their knowledge and offers a quicker and slightly more engaging method of mastering profit interpretation. This paper also presents a comparative analysis of explanation facilities in contemporary tools for developing expert systems and business rules. The JEFF explanation facility, which was developed for the prototype to function, is then presented and evaluated. The evaluation was twofold and was conducted to determine if objectives have been met and how JEFF compares to similar tools. It was confirmed that nearly all objectives have been met and that JEFF is almost as effective as the professional tool it was compared to. When summarizing all results, it can be concluded that the hypotheses are validated (indeed, the proposed methods and techniques can be successfully used for the purpose of creating information), but the proposed method was not tested in a business environment. The prototype that was created demonstrates that the method is feasible to implement, but its effectiveness was only evaluated in terms of being a teaching aid for students, not as a tool to assist managers in interpreting data. If the proposed method were to be implemented in practice, it would be necessary to develop applications that cater to managers' needs and that would actually operate in a business environment.
