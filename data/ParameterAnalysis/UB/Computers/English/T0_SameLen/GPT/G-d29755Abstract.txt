The cloud computing sector has seen tremendous growth over the last ten years. This study assesses different cloud environments and the services they offer to customers. Several issues have been identified in cloud usage, posing significant challenges for users. Even before the advent of the cloud, users and administrators of relational databases faced numerous problems. Issues like software updates for relational database services on a cloud platform became the service provider's responsibility, leading to a notable reduction in operational costs. However, service improvement and query optimization issues escalated due to the increased number of relational databases and the higher abstraction level introduced by the cloud environment. Detailed service usage information is continuously gathered in the cloud environment. A system is proposed here that, based on this data, helps users understand how the relational database operates and identifies the problem's source more easily. After a thorough review of related work, the system is meticulously designed and developed. It incorporates two types of statistical data models for both recall and precision, and an expert system for final decision-making. The suitable infrastructure is built on a microservice architecture. The project team consisted of several members with diverse skills. The system is deployed on the Microsoft Azure platform, with some specific implementation details also shared. The system underwent comprehensive testing and evaluation using real data workload from the Azure SQL relational database's production environment over six months. The results demonstrated a significant enhancement in query execution performance. Feedback from customers who used this service indicated a substantial improvement in user experience. The conclusion provides a project overview, suggests system improvement ideas, and discusses how a similar approach can be applied in scientific fields.
