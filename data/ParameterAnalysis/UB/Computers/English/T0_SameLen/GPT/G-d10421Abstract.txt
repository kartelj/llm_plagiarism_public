As international operations globalize, managing intellectual capital becomes increasingly crucial. The prevailing belief today is that effective intellectual capital management is a key to organizational success. Intellectual capital is now a vital resource and operational base for modern organizations. In the early 1920s, the concept of intellectual capital became significant. Studying this concept significantly increases an organization's market value compared to its book value. Unlike tangible assets that depreciate with use, proper utilization of intellectual capital enhances an organization's value. Management is expected to identify and exploit opportunities and strengths in the face of drastic environmental changes, while minimizing or eliminating weaknesses. This approach fosters organizational growth and development. Intellectual capital holds operational and strategic importance for organizations. Today, there is growing interest in managing intellectual capital, which includes human capital, structural and relational capital. Intellectual capital encompasses not just organizational knowledge, but also staff competencies, organizational structure, business processes, intellectual property, and corporate culture. Both internal and external resources, including relationships with stakeholders, are crucial. Intellectual capital includes factors not reflected in official financial statements but are vital for creating organizational value. Proper utilization of intellectual capital enhances an organization's value, with quality being more important than quantity for creating added value. Intellectual capital is a guide to future dynamic environmental changes. This thesis aims to explore how organizations identify, evaluate, and report intellectual capital. It reviews relevant literature on intellectual capital and previous studies on its management in organizations. Empirical research within the thesis discusses the concept of intellectual capital in Serbian organizations and its importance for financial reporting. The study confirms the thesis hypothesis that providing an accurate intellectual capital position is a leading performance indicator in the modern age, aiming to ensure complete information. The final conclusion emphasizes the need to value intellectual capital and present it in an additional financial statement for the most reliable and accurate representation of an organization's value. The current set of financial statements and quantitative indicators do not adequately present necessary information, so quantified non-financial elements or descriptive forms can provide a clearer picture of the organization's value and potential.
