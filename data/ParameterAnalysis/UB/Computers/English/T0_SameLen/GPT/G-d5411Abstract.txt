This thesis explores the discovery of fuzzy functional dependencies within fuzzy relational database models. The aim is to examine and analyze recent findings in this field, and to create our own algorithm for identifying dependencies between attributes in fuzzy relations, based on fuzzy implication in fuzzy logic. The issue of analyzing fuzzy functional dependencies in fuzzy relational database models is not a new one. Over the past two decades, numerous papers and authors have addressed this topic. However, a literature review revealed that no algorithm currently exists that can identify attribute relationships in relational schemas. This gap prompted the development of our methodology for analyzing fuzzy functional dependencies across a given set of attributes. Addressing this not-so-new problem is not just a theoretical challenge, but also has practical implications. The implementation of logical database models from previous theories and their integration into other areas and fields (GIS, Data Mining, Information Retrieval, reducing data redundancy, estimating NULL values, etc.) are key objectives of this paper. The initial hypothesis was that fuzzy set theory and a specific fragment of fuzzy logic are the ideal solution when database managers cannot definitively determine the relationships between data and attributes within a relation. In the realm of artificial intelligence, fuzzy sets and fuzzy logic are examined in the context of fuzzy relational database design within intelligent systems, as they are effective tools for handling and representing imprecise and uncertain information. Identifying potential dependencies between attributes in fuzzy relations is essentially a data mining technique related to hidden and useful knowledge used for decision making. This thesis introduces a new technique for identifying existing dependencies between pairs of tuples using various fuzzy implications, as described by the author. Fuzzy implications that meet established acceptance criteria are used to estimate linguistic strength θ when fuzzy functional θ dependency X → Y is met. To demonstrate the proposed methodology and verify the research, we conducted an experiment on real data under two different models: a fuzzy database model based on proximity relation and a fuzzy database model with possibility distribution. Discovering potential dependencies between attributes of the observed fuzzy relation represents the discovery of hidden and useful knowledge, i.e., a data mining technique. To identify a fuzzy functional dependency within the corresponding fuzzy model, the following steps are necessary: 1. Prepare the data for analysis (preprocessing, data summarization, data warehousing, etc.). 2. Find subrelations (n-tuples) on the observed attributes with potentially hidden fuzzy functional dependencies. 3. Associate fuzzy functional dependencies with corresponding fuzzy implications. 4. Interpret search results to obtain the final set of fuzzy dependencies. From a practical standpoint, in the search for fuzzy functional dependencies within fuzzy database models using the proposed methodology, it is necessary to also conduct an efficiency analysis. The main potential drawback is the total number of transactions (possible pairs of tuples with associated values) that need to be computed, which can be very costly for large databases. Increasing the number of tuples, as well as the number of attributes of the relational scheme, exponentially increases the number of tuples. However, in this PhD thesis, we propose and demonstrate that it is possible to increase the efficiency of the algorithm and reduce the number of computed transactions. However, it should be noted that the nature of the problem at hand determines the efficiency of the algorithm. Some databases do not require compression, while others, particularly large databases, may benefit from various reduction techniques such as data summarization based on fuzzification, cluster formation, granulation, and representing a number of similar tuples with one representative tuple. Overall, our research demonstrates how to extract intelligent information from fuzzy relational databases. To identify potential relations between attributes of a fuzzy relation, we must first prepare the data for analysis, i.e., create a table with pairs of tuples and conformance values on all attributes of the original relation. The next step is to find sub-relations where the criteria for the existence of fuzzy dependencies are met. The third step is to associate fuzzy functional dependencies with corresponding fuzzy implications. Finally, we interpret the results of the previous steps to obtain the final set of fuzzy functional dependencies. The most significant contribution of this thesis is the characterization of fuzzy set theory and fuzzy implications in the context of developing tools and algorithms that facilitate the identification of relations between attributes in the observed relational schemes. It should be noted that this paper is an empirical study and a "proof-of-concept", without developed commercial software. Furthermore, we discussed certain practical cases where this methodology may be applicable. Our experiments suggest that the results provided by the algorithm are acceptable. In future work, we plan to apply this research in various scenarios and applications involving this methodology, such as: estimating null values in relational databases, text mining, extracting dependencies from practical knowledge databases, etc.
