The dissertation's research topic focuses on online frontier-based strategies for environmental exploration, utilizing the D* Lite algorithm for robotic path planning and multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) methods for next position selection. The decision-making process considers the length of a collision-free path, anticipated information gain, and distance from the base station. The average robot path traveled was used to gauge exploration efficiency, considering various starting positions for 90% environmental exploration. Matlab simulations demonstrated that under specified conditions, TOPSIS outperforms the other two MCDM methods (SAW and COPRAS) and four traditional strategies from literature in complex environmental exploration. This is attributed to TOPSIS maximizing the Euclidean distance from the hypothetical worst solution, thereby minimizing decision-making risk in complex environments. Key findings were confirmed using the Gazebo 3D simulator and the Robot Operating System. The dissertation also suggests two methods for enhancing robot path planning in search and rescue missions. The first method combines the D* Lite algorithm with fuzzy logic to determine map cell costs for robot path planning, avoiding binary values. This allows for priority-based object exploration and prevents mapping robots from interfering with others. The second method combines the D* Lite algorithm with online learning, reducing the mapping robot's path and minimizing risky movement by preemptively avoiding obstacles.
