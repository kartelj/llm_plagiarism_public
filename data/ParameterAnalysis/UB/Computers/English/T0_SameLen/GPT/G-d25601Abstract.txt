Current trends in computer design strive to enhance computer system performance to the maximum level to accommodate the processing of vast data quantities. The focus is on the processor's design as the primary player in the data processing procedure. The growth trends in processor performance, as predicted by Moore's Law, have recently been slowing due to the physical constraints of semiconductor technology, making performance enhancement increasingly difficult. This issue is being addressed by various methods aimed at boosting performance without increasing transistor and power consumption. This thesis considers asymmetric multicore processors with support for transactional memory. Two novel techniques have been suggested to boost the performance of such processors. One method seeks to lessen transaction congestion due to high parallelism by moving transactions to a faster core. The transactions contributing most to congestion occurrence are chosen for migration. Running them on a faster core lowers their conflict chances with other transactions, thereby increasing the chance of avoiding congestion. Another method modifies the cache subsystem to decrease cache access latency and reduce false conflict chances while lowering the number of transistors needed for cache implementation. This can be accomplished by using small and simple caches. Detailed implementation proposals are provided for both techniques. Prototypes of these techniques were created in the Gem5 simulator, which accurately models the processor's system. Using prototypes, the suggested techniques were assessed by simulating numerous applications from a standard benchmark set for transactional memory. The simulation results analysis provided recommendations on when and how the suggested techniques should be employed.
