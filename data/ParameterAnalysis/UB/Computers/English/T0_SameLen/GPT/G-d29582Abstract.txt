The rapid expansion of data and devices has spurred the growth of technology and machine learning algorithms utilized in data analysis and processing systems. The performance of these systems, which handle vast amounts of data, relies solely on data quality, the chosen algorithm, and its parameters. Data anomalies, which deviate from data distribution and impact data quality, can be identified through machine learning algorithms. The choice of algorithm and parameters for anomaly detection is entirely dependent on the system creator or domain expert's expertise. In situations where there is no sample data with labeled anomalies, a common occurrence in the real world, selecting the appropriate algorithm for anomaly detection is not a straightforward task. The process of choosing an algorithm for anomaly detection tasks can be automated using an automated machine learning system (AutoML) that suggests an algorithm for anomaly detection based on data and meta-features. An increasing number of research papers are highlighting AutoML frameworks, which are emerging as a promising solution for constructing complex machine learning models without human expertise and assistance. The primary challenge in enabling AutoML frameworks to construct an efficient model for anomaly detection tasks is to identify the best underlying model for a given task and optimization metric. Meta-learning approaches based on a set of meta-features that describe data properties can facilitate efficient model selection in AutoML frameworks. Existing meta-learning approaches that rely on statistical and information-theoretic meta-features necessitate large amounts of data and computational resources to extract data properties. The focus of this doctoral dissertation is the creation of a scalable system for extracting meta-features based on domain-specific knowledge. The aim is to assess the proposed set of meta-features by comparing existing solutions through various complexity aspects against the proposed solution. Additionally, the objective is to design experiments and obtain results that can be utilized in future automated machine learning research. Based on the evaluation of experimental results, the proposed meta-features demonstrate an accuracy of 87% and fulfill the critical requirements for use in AutoML systems, while existing solutions have an accuracy of 73%. In situations where there is a lack of significant datasets for evaluation, the proposed solution performs 25% worse than existing solutions. The research's significance lies in the potential to implement AutoML systems based on the proposed set of meta-features. In situations where there is no sample data with labeled anomalies, or data is absent, the data creator or domain expert will be able to effectively characterize the anomalies in the data, based on domain-specific knowledge.
