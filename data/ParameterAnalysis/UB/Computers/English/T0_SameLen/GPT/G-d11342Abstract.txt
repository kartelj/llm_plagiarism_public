Conducting business in today's world involves managing relationships with numerous stakeholders. Maintaining positive relations with these stakeholders is considered a primary objective for businesses, as a stable network of business relationships is viewed as a crucial asset for the company. Communication is a fundamental part of any relationship, hence strategic or corporate communications are seen as a vital part of the relationship between the company and its stakeholders. These communications aim to build and position the corporate brand, as confirmed in the dissertation. The role of corporate communications in relationship management is to coordinate and manage all company communications. The concept of corporate branding is a subject of interest for both academics and practitioners, as it has been shown to influence business outcomes. It is viewed as a significant source of sustainable competitiveness and a key component of corporate strategy. In this context, the positioning of the corporate brand is seen as the company's overall approach in relation to its competitors, or how stakeholders perceive the company in comparison to its competition. After reviewing the existing literature on positioning and its application in corporate branding, this dissertation includes the specifics, types, and framework of corporate brand positioning. Based on scientific and professional literature and the analysis of empirical research results, a strategic framework for managing corporate communications is established for the purpose of positioning the corporate brand. The author has developed a model of corporate brand positioning and determined the CBPS (Corporate Brand Positioning Score) through empirical research. The research identified and measured business aspects that affect corporate brand positioning among 6 citizens/business community, the impact levels of certain business aspects on corporate brand positioning, and determined the model's structure and measure corporate brand positioning among citizens/business community. It also identified how demographic characteristics of citizens, or business community characteristics, influence the connection between the perception of certain business aspects and corporate brand positioning. The research demonstrated that the perception of all defined components: Perception position, Attitude towards the company, Social responsibility, Management, Companies/Products, to varying degrees, influence the positioning of the corporate brand among Serbian citizens. In modeling the corporate brand positioning and determining the CBPS for the business community, used characteristics of the corporate brand, which due to terminology consistency with previous research are called determinants, include: Reliability, Neutrality, Efficiency, Independence, Adherence to principles, Good employee relations, Social responsibility, Understanding smaller companies, Professionalism, Credibility. From the perspective of corporate brand positioning, nurturing identified determinants is crucial as their values impact the CBPS. The research findings highlight aspects that are important for positioning the corporate brand among citizens and the business community, and provide a foundation for strategic communications with stakeholders.
