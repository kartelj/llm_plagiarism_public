A literature review revealed multiple perspectives on the notion of performance. The common thread among most interpretations is that performance is the measurable actions or behaviors that contribute to achieving organizational objectives. Performance indicators are a crucial management tool that guide management towards the most beneficial long-term strategies and effective short-term decision-making. Financial indicators, based on current and past performance, are utilized to predict future business operations. These financial indicators are inseparable from performance indicators of other business functions. Performance management is a superior management system that integrates other systems and forms the foundation for appropriate managerial decision-making. This thesis aims to examine the potential interconnection between financial performance and organizational performance. The organization's success is determined by a widely accepted approach. The primary hypothesis that there is a correlation between business success and financial performance indicators has been confirmed through a review of secondary sources and empirical research conducted on the most successful companies over a five-year period. The findings indicate that most successful companies' financial performance indicators tend to cluster at certain intervals. The data's statistical analysis revealed a distinct correlation between certain financial performance indicators and the company's age and industry. Consequently, empirical research discovered a statistically significant difference between the values of certain financial performance indicators in more successful and less successful organizations. Based on the research's data analysis, a new theoretically established management concept based on financial performance indicators has been defined.
