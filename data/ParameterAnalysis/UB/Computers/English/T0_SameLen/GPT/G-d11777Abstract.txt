A data warehouse serves as the foundation for business intelligence systems, data integration, and decision-making support. Typically, a dimensional model is constructed for the data warehouse to enhance data visualization. The architecture of a data warehouse outlines the basic elements and their interconnections and structures. Two main approaches exist in data warehouse architecture. The first, known as CIF (Corporate Information Factory) architecture, is advocated by Bill Inmon, who asserts that a data warehouse should be normalized and contain atomic data in the third normal form. The second approach, the BUS architecture, is championed by Ralph Kimball, who argues for a multi-dimensional structure in the warehouse. Daniel Linstedt designed the Data Vault concept of a data warehouse, which is a detail-oriented, historically tracked, and uniquely linked group of normalized tables supporting one or more business functional areas. This hybrid approach combines the best features of the third normal form (3NF) and star schema. The Data Vault concept highlights the importance of tracking the source and timing of data entry into the database and allows for easy changes in the data warehouse structure to align with business environment changes. Data warehouses are constructed using various methodological approaches. However, the process of designing a data warehouse and the associated dimensional model is not automated. This dissertation examined the issue of the data warehouse design process, conducted a comprehensive literature analysis, and explored the potential for automating the physical design of a data warehouse based on the Data Vault concept, with minimal user interaction. The study introduces a simple algorithm for automating the physical design of a data warehouse based on the Data Vault concept, using a data model with metadata transactional data sources and rules. The algorithm for direct access to the physical design of a data warehouse formalizes, generalizes, and largely automates the physical design process for data warehouses based on a physical model of structured, semi-structured, and simple non-structured data sources. The relational model is a common factor for both Data Vault implementation and original data, which is why all types are abstracted with a meta-model. The direct approach implies that the Physical Data Vault - PDV is directly realized based on the physical data source model in relational form. The conceptualization of metadata is presented with a physical data model that, with minor modifications, can be used in the design of individual data warehouses and represents the basic methodological contribution of the study. Additionally, this study provides a comprehensive integrated approach to automating data warehouse design because the approach enables the design of data marts and related ETL processes (from a source to a data warehouse and from a data warehouse to data marts). This approach integrates all activities required for the realization of a complete data warehouse. Based on the research findings in the dissertation, a prototype application was developed to support the physical design of a data warehouse. Experiments with the algorithm, using a prototype of the design automation application, on a real case in the healthcare insurance sector, yielded satisfactory results.
