'This thesis examines the use of contemporary software engineering techniques in open source software creation for intelligent systems. The primary outcomes include a universal software framework model and advice for managing open source projects in this area. The framework model and project management suggestions were created and tested in real-world scenarios through the enhancement of a chosen software framework for neural networks. The selected neural network framework is a leading Java open source neural network framework. The proposed software development techniques can also be applied in other intelligent systems fields, addressing issues and specific needs in this area. Many of these issues arise from the fact that the software is often designed for research purposes but must also be practical and user-friendly. The suggested development methods pertain to requirements specification, planning, design, implementation, and maintenance. They are presented as proven best practices. Besides these theoretical and methodological contributions, this thesis also offers practical contributions by introducing new features for a chosen framework in the field of intelligent systems, significantly improving its practical use.
