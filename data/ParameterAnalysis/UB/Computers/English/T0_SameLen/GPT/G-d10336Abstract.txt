This study introduces a unique approach to monitor students' focus using Internet of Things and machine learning algorithms. The primary hypothesis validated in this doctoral dissertation is that the application of the Internet of Things in education can enhance teaching effectiveness by establishing a system to monitor students' attention, allowing for the analysis of environmental factors and the display of processed findings. To offer additional understanding necessary for the execution of the aforementioned processes and to validate the need for conducting the featured study, a review of pertinent computer and social science research is conducted. This review encompasses a comparative analysis of smart classroom platforms, which serve as a conduit for these emerging algorithms to develop and identify sociological contexts at the point of emergence. Sociological sciences are crucial as they aid in comprehending the backdrop of the sociological processes being observed and categorized; hence a review of sociological sciences and social signals primarily is presented to conclude a review of relevant research and align the direction of further implementation of the suggested system. Moreover, the review has also outlined potential parameters and algorithms that could be employed, accompanied by a description of the methodology for all research phases. Subsequently, the requirements of such a system are examined and essential features needed for detection are identified, along with sociological factors that impact these features. Pattern classification is achieved by employing a machine learning technique that necessitates a classifier based on a specific dataset. Prior to implementation, system simulation is conducted on a dataset not used in the training process. During simulation, the system demonstrated an average accuracy of 92.2%. Following the simulation, the system was deployed and its performance assessed by comparing real-time annotator (i.e., students' feedback) with the system output during lectures. The system's average accuracy evaluated for three distinct student groups was 81.9%.
