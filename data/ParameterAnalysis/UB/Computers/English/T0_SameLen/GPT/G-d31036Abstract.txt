This doctoral thesis primarily focuses on a classification model, aiming to develop a model that utilizes case-based reasoning (CBR) and intelligent selection of similarity measures for more accurate classification of new cases. The potential for better utilization of domain knowledge, expressed through preference functions, to enhance the predictive performance of a CBR system is explored. The thesis also investigates if a model that employs specific similarity measures for categorical data, combined with preference functions for numerical data similarity measurement, can outperform the conventional k-NN CBR model. Similarity measurement between cases is a crucial component of every CBR model. Typically, CBR models use the Euclidean metric for numerical variables similarity measurement and the overlap function for categorical attributes. Preference theory functions could also be employed for case similarity measurement, offering more ways to express decision makers' preferences. The thesis will present the results of classification models that use specific similarity measures for categorical attributes and preference functions for numerical attributes. The thesis encompasses attribute weight optimization and the impact of the number of nearest neighbors considered on the models' predictive power. A genetic algorithm is employed to set the parameters of each preference function and attribute weights. The model's performance is evaluated on three distinct benchmark datasets of clients seeking credit application consideration. Models' accuracy is assessed using a 10-fold cross-validation test, with cross-validation folds generated using a seed for data randomization. Experimental results indicate that the proposed methods using preference theory functions consistently outperform the traditional k-NN classifier, irrespective of the similarity measures used for categorical attributes. Conversely, models using preference theory functions and different categorical data similarity measures demonstrated that there is always an optimal technique for each specific dataset, which also employs an appropriate categorical attribute similarity measure alongside preference theory functions.
