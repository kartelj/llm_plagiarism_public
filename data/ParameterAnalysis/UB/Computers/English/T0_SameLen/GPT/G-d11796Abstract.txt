Wireless sensor networks comprise numerous small computing devices, known as sensor nodes. Each sensor node is equipped with one or more sensors to collect environmental data and can establish radio communication with other nodes in the network. These networks generate vast amounts of data, making them ideal for implementing machine learning methods. The aim of this work is to adapt chosen data mining algorithms for distributed execution, enabling them to run directly on the sensor nodes.

Upon analyzing the problem, three fundamental requirements for a distributed data mining algorithm suitable for execution in a wireless sensor network were identified. Firstly, it is crucial to minimize node communication as it consumes substantial energy. Secondly, the algorithm must produce accurate results. Lastly, reliance on centralized computational resources should be minimized as much as possible.

The primary contribution of this thesis is the development of two innovative algorithms for distributed machine learning, tailored to meet the demands of execution in a wireless sensor network. The first algorithm is a two-layer classification scheme. The initial layer runs on the sensor nodes and can employ any classifier type (the method was tested using J48 decision trees). The results from this stage are then forwarded to a centralized, second layer classifier based on a weighted voting scheme. The second algorithm is a clustering algorithm, based on Kohonen neural networks. The network's architecture is adapted to the data nature obtained from sensor nodes in wireless sensor networks. Such data include two variability sources: the event location information being sensed and the event's properties. Based on this observation, the proposed Kohonen neural network is designed to contain two layers, the first layer clusters data according to the origin location, and the second layer clusters data based on the underlying event type.

Calculations indicate that both proposed algorithms significantly reduce energy consumption. The algorithms' accuracy was confirmed through computational simulations. In conclusion, the proposed algorithms are suitable for numerous practical applications, and the machine learning methods provide a feasible approach to constructing sustainable large wireless sensor networks.
