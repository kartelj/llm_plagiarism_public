This doctoral thesis primarily focuses on the creation of a novel methodological framework and the practical application of an internal credit rating model for medium to large Serbian companies. The primary objective is to quantify the credit risk of these companies using a newly developed credit scoring model and to evaluate their credit quality using the developed internal credit rating model. The research is based on seven years of financial statement data, including balance sheets and income statements, from Serbian companies from 2006 to 2012. This data allows for the quantification of the default probability of these companies, taking into account the unique characteristics of this market and business environment. This doctoral dissertation, based on a new and original methodology established by the author, encompasses three broad areas. The first involves the analysis of a large number of financial ratios and the identification of the most predictive financial ratio in Serbia, based on historical data. The transformation of financial ratio data has been used to develop the credit scoring model. The main outcome is a new credit scoring model that quantifies default probability and has greater predictive power than models like the Altman Z-score model, which were developed and used in foreign markets. Ultimately, an internal credit rating model was proposed and developed using an original approach that incorporates the results from the previously developed credit scoring model. The final models and their results were validated using processes recommended by academic literature and the new Basel Capital Accord standards. Credit risk weights based on Basel II and III principles were calculated, and it was shown that all results presented in this research support the initial hypothesis of this doctoral dissertation.
