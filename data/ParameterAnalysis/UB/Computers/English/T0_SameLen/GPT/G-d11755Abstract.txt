Despite significant advancements in artificial intelligence, the human brain remains superior in understanding and manipulating partially known information. This is particularly evident in the field of question answering, where human experts excel in providing explanations, combining complex responses, and abstract reasoning. Intelligent Question Routing Systems (IQRS) act as a conduit for knowledge exchange in any area of expertise that requires extensive user interaction. The advantages of implementing such systems include reducing unnecessary engagement of experts and enhancing the quality of service for system owners (e.g., businesses, governments, universities) as users are more satisfied with the responses they receive. This dissertation presents a methodology for designing IQRS systems, beginning with a review of existing research in this field, with a focus on the implementation of IQRS process phases. The review also introduces a unique presentation paradigm that encapsulates the essence of approaches found in existing literature. This paradigm includes three fundamental processing stages related to the three main challenges of system implementation: question analysis, question forwarding, and user knowledge profiling. The result of this analysis is a proposed new approach to address these challenges. The remainder of the dissertation describes an IQRS prototype that implements these proposed ideas. The question analysis module uses an approach that allows for question visualization, providing a clear representation of specific relationships between concepts and their relevance to the question. This approach combines fully automated text processing with manual correction of results, allowing users to improve output accuracy. Concurrently, the implemented text processing module is used for answer analysis. Next, an analysis and discussion of existing methods for determining the semantic similarity of two short texts is provided, with a particular focus on those suitable for languages with limited electronic linguistic resources, such as Serbian. Based on these conclusions, a new algorithm named LInSTSS is proposed, which calculates the semantic similarity between two short texts by considering the specificity of the words they contain. Additionally, a Serbian paraphrase corpus is constructed, and the results obtained using this corpus show that the proposed algorithm outperforms existing solutions. Finally, evaluation on paraphrase corpora for both English and Serbian is used to fine-tune algorithm parameters. The lessons learned are applied to design the module for calculating the semantic similarity between a question and a user profile. In the question forwarding phase, issues related to comparing questions and user profiles are discussed, and a new algorithm called P2Q is proposed. This algorithm determines the highest similarity between the concepts identified in the question and those in the user profile. Finally, an analysis of available web portals is conducted to identify one suitable for creating a questions and answers corpus. In the created corpus, three different types of users are identified, modeling: (1) interests, (2) knowledge, and (3) both knowledge and interests. The corpus is then used to test the initial hypothesis and evaluate the overall system performance. The results show that the P2Q approach significantly outperforms other evaluated approaches. It was also observed that the use of semantic information extraction from text can improve results. The scientific contribution of the dissertation is in the field of analysis and synthesis of a software system designed to intelligently route questions. Additionally, based on the evaluation results, it was found that properly assigned weights can improve the overall performance of the system, but if not assigned correctly, performance can significantly decrease. Finally, it was concluded that for profiling the user's ability to answer a given question, it is important to consider not only the answers the user provided best, i.e., to profile knowledge, but also to consider questions that can express interests.
