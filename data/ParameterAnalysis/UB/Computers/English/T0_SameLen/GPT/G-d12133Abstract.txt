Assessing the work needed to develop a software system is among the most challenging yet crucial tasks in software engineering. The effort estimate often determines if the project will commence, the constraints under which it will be executed, and its likelihood of successful completion and utilization. The truth is, these estimates are frequently made based on incomplete requirements using a variety of heuristics, assumptions, and experience, where the best possible estimates are needed within a restricted timeframe. Despite significant progress in various software engineering areas over the past few decades, effort estimation methods largely rely on the subjective judgement of project teams or field experts, with the errors in effort estimates often exceeding expectations. Worldwide statistics reveal that only a third of software projects are successfully completed, a third exceed budget and time constraints, while the remaining projects fail. One of the primary reasons for these outcomes is inaccurate effort estimates. This thesis aims to examine current effort estimation methods and suggest new ones that can enhance effort estimation. The fundamental concept to be discussed in the thesis is the application of novel models and techniques to improve existing effort estimation methods. The thesis will present suggestions for enhancing current evaluation methods and specific results that can be achieved using these solutions in actual software projects. Improvements are limited to identifying project parameters that most impact the effort, as well as establishing correlations between these parameters and the effort.
