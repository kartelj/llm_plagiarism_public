This study provides a methodological framework for constructing a telecommunication company's information system based on models, by integrating general IS development strategies and a specific initiative within the telecommunication sector:  MDA (Model Driven Architecture), a software development approach standardized and endorsed by OMG (Object Management Group).  EA (Enterprise Architecture), a strategy for concurrent development of a company's Business and IT Architecture. TOGAF (The Open Group Architectural Framework) is the most prevalent and recognized architecture framework and method for enterprise architecture development.  NGOSS (New Generation Operations Systems and Software), a program under development by the Telemanagement Forum that offers a framework for the development and implementation of "Operation and Business Support Systems – OSS/BSS" within the telecommunication industry.  SPL (Software Product Line), an IS development over Software Product Lines, signifies a contemporary approach to automating domain-specific model-driven software development, where a software product family, rather than a single software product, is developed through domain engineering. The methodological framework is grounded on a software product line specific to the telecommunication domain, which is based on NGOSS frameworks and models and enables efficient construction of a Telecommunication Company IS through three distinct processes:  General domain engineering for the telecommunication domain,  Domain engineering for the type of service in the telecommunication domain,  Application engineering. To establish a methodological framework for the development of a model-driven telecom operator IS, it is crucial to understand the following dimensions of complexity in telecommunication domains: Functional Domains, Areas of Integrated Processes, Types of Telecommunication Services, IS Development Life-Cycles Phases, Specific Telecom Operators IS is being developed for. Subsequently, it is necessary to define both mutual relationships and dimension-shifting sequences. The initial basic scheme that classifies the telecommunication domain by sub-domains and horizontal and vertical dependencies between sub-domains was established based on the eTOM and SID NGOSS Framework. The fundamental mechanism, termed "Multi-level Staged Configuration", was defined as a technique that navigates the complexity of the telecommunication domain and functions as a transition from one sub-domain to another. When such a mechanism is applied to the initial basic classification scheme, the result is a system for multi-level staged configuration of the telecommunication domain. Following this, it is possible to define a framework for a telecommunication domain software product line that, through domain and application engineering, encompasses all previously mentioned dimensions of domain complexity. Due to the multidimensional complexity of the telecommunication domain, this approach implies specific domain engineering which consists of two levels: General domain engineering for the telecommunication domain and Domain engineering for the type of service. The General domain engineering for the telecommunication domain; One of the crucial steps of this domain process is defining the system for Horizontal Multi-level Staged Configuration (HMLSC) HMLSC system is responsible for the controlled and comprehensive definition of all initial Features Models by functional areas of the telecommunication domain. The System is implemented through four HMLSC schemes. Within a functional area, models are horizontally dependent on each other and are constructed in accordance with defined dependencies between sub-domains. In addition to Feature Models by functional areas, all necessary UML model patterns are also defined: Data Model Templates, Behavior Templates (applications and processes), etc. Another significant step of General domain engineering for the telecommunication domain is defining the system for Vertical Multi-level Staged Configuration (VMLSC). This system is implemented through six configuration schemes. A primary result of Vertical Multi-level Staged Configuration execution is the implementation of vertical processes development through multi-level staged transformation of Feature Model, where the result (configuration) from the previous level represents input parameters for model construction on a lower level. The next crucial step is Defining the system for Model Generation. Features Models represent well common and different features of product families. However, feature models do not serve their own purpose. They represent a guideline for the construction of domain-specific data or behavior models. It means that feature models should be mapped into other models to transmit to them the necessary semantics. Mapping of MC into other models is performed through model generation schemes. Domain engineering for the type of service in the telecommunication domain. In this section of the Software Product Line (SPL) for the telecommunication domain, the configuration schemes for Horizontal Multi-level Staged Configuration (HMLSC), defined in General Domain engineering, are further elaborated. These schemes typically represent rules and a path for defining models for the type of service. Through the use of these schemes, all initial Feature Models for IPTV service are defined by functional areas of the telecommunication domain. In the second section, the schemes elaborated in General Domain Engineering for the telecommunication domain that form the System for Vertical Multi-level Staged Configuration (VMLSC) are further elaborated. These schemes typically represent rules and a path for defining End-to-End Processes for the type of service. Through the use of these schemes, Feature Models are mutually annotated and a procedure of vertical processes development for IPTV service is defined. In the section of this domain process, schemes for automated configuration and generation of UML models of class diagrams and activity diagrams for IPTV service, based on UML model templates for IPTV and configurations of Feature Models, are also defined. Application engineering for the telecommunication domain allows for the specification and generation of a specific operator’s IS. Simultaneously, this part, as well as the entire methodological approach, is illustrated through step-wise tailoring and generation of a specific IS for a specific IPTV service operator. Configuration of a specific operator’s request for IS (Including IS) is performed first. After that, the IS is being tailored in detail using Vertical Multi-level Staged Configuration. During this process, generation of a specific telecom operator’s IS models is performed. Model-driven methodological approach to the development of a telecommunication company IS contributes to the solution of the following problems of IS development:  Solution of IT and Business Alignment, a problem that arises from differences in abstraction levels of Business and IT concepts.  Finding the way to overcome Multidimensional complexities of the telecommunication domain.  Solution of the problem of IS development caused by Business Dynamism, because, besides being complex, Business is also highly dynamical due to constant and fast switches of technologies, user requests for new services, market competition, etc.  Allowing mass customization of services that remained unsolved by the existing methodological approaches, due to the uncompleted solution of the software reuse problem.  Supplements to general EA approaches and NGOSS domain EA with detailed models of the telecommunication domain that are functional with specific telecom operators, through the use of the existing ISs.  Allowing more efficient model transformation that represents one of the major general problems in the MDA approach. This work concludes with a review and a comparative overview of the advantages and disadvantages of the existing approaches and methods used in the thesis and discusses the advantages brought by the approach the thesis sets forth. The automation of the presented methodological approach brings more efficient IS development; especially bearing in mind the great potential of this approach for becoming the general methodology of IS development.
