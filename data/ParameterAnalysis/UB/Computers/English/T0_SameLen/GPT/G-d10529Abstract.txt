Human resource development hinges on knowledge. For both individuals and companies to remain competitive and survive in the market, the use of modern knowledge is essential. Knowledge can be gained through education, both formal and informal, in schools, colleges, and workplaces, both traditional and online. Currently, science is focusing on e-learning and e-education through the use of advanced information-communication technologies. This PhD examines the informal aspects of e-learning using Web 2.0 tools, and the advantages and characteristics of incorporating them into formal education. Despite the relative familiarity with e-learning methods and forms, they are not adequately utilized, particularly in our context. This paper investigates the effects of implementing informal e-learning forms using Web 2.0 tools (e-learning 2.0) in enhancing human resource potential. The concept of a personal learning environment as a method of structuring informal e-learning 2.0 is utilized. In this context, the shift from traditional pedagogy to pedagogy 2.0 is examined. This shift is evident in the transition from a teacher-controlled environment with a rigid didactic learning regime to a social, collaborative, and participatory approach in task design and student involvement, and to a learner-centered approach and pedagogy 2.0. To validate these concepts in practice, a pedagogical model for designing a personal environment for e-learning 2.0 is developed and applied through an action research study. A survey is conducted to assess knowledge of Web 2.0 tools and to analyze how students use these tools for learning. The survey participants were students from the Faculty of Organizational Sciences, from all years and study fields. The study concluded that the use of informal e-learning 2.0 in colleges is significantly influenced by the students' individual characteristics and potentials and field of study on one hand, and by teachers and their course organization on the other. In this regard, fourth-year students studying information systems and technologies were identified as an appropriate population to test the developed model. To investigate the potential of using personal learning environments (PLE) in formal education as a method of structuring informal e-learning 2.0, an action research study was conducted on the E-Learning course at the Faculty of Organizational Sciences. For this purpose, a pedagogical PLE model for e-learning 2.0 was developed. This model represents a new approach to designing a personal learning environment for e-learning 2.0 - a model for structuring informal e-learning 2.0. Additionally, an activity algorithm was designed as a framework for implementing the model through the teaching process. It was demonstrated that it is feasible to apply the pedagogical PLE model for e-learning 2.0 in formal education. Most students had positive attitudes about this learning organization and found it creative and interesting. Based on these findings, it can be concluded that it is possible to innovate formal education by using a pedagogical PLE model for e-learning 2.0 based on an informal learning concept. This approach could potentially influence the development potential of human resources, future employees, by enhancing the skills needed to work in a 2.0 environment, thereby better preparing them for the future contemporary working environment.
