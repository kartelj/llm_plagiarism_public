The number of internet-connectable digital multimedia devices in contemporary households, including mobile devices like smartphones and tablets, as well as digital TVs and set-top boxes, has significantly risen in recent years. These readily accessible devices, customizable via software, simplify the development of distributed applications. Applications created in an integrated environment can provide users with unique human-computer interaction scenarios compared to those offered by a single device. A study of existing Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) systems that merge digital TV and mobile devices in a living room setting revealed that current systems have ad-hoc implementations with limited flexibility and lack the capacity to explore various HCI scenario combinations. This dissertation introduces the SHARP development framework, which facilitates efficient implementation of distributed systems in an integrated environment comprising digital TV, mobile devices, and the internet. The framework aims to help HCI researchers develop innovative applications that provide various HCI scenario combinations in the living room with less effort. The dissertation begins by presenting survey results that provide an overview of existing HCI systems designed for a living room setting. Common features of these systems are identified, and a list of potential HCI scenarios that applications developed for an integrated environment can offer is compiled. These include content sharing across multiple screens, mobile device control of central screen actions, motion detection via sensors, additional sensory feedback, passive TV viewing combined with parallel interaction, user experience enhancement through access to various information services, and interaction between co-located and non-co-located individuals. After identifying these scenarios, a proposal for the SHARP development framework is detailed, including its design and implementation. The SHARP framework's design enables developers to create applications that incorporate the identified scenarios. The field of game development was chosen to validate the framework's benefits. Game applications have proven popular and profitable. Five different games were developed using the SHARP framework to demonstrate its flexibility and showcase novel applications offering new scenario combinations to users. Conclusions about user acceptance of the identified scenarios were drawn from the experiences of 59 test users interacting with the developed game applications. The SHARP framework was validated by comparing the size, complexity, and responsiveness of applications developed with and without the framework. The results indicate that the framework reduced both development and testing effort by shifting complex game implementation logic to reusable framework components. Responsiveness measurements from applications developed with and without the framework reveal that while the framework's use slightly increased response time, all versions remained within acceptable performance parameters.
