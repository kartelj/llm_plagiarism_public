Three-dimensional (3D) videos are increasingly prevalent in both wired and wireless networks, and their high data content places a significant burden on these networks. This effect of 3D video on network traffic necessitates the enhancement of methods to manage this kind of data. The focus of this thesis is the fractal and multifractal characterization of 3D video formats, with the primary objectives being to demonstrate that 3D video possesses fractal and multifractal attributes, to explain these attributes, to compare these attributes across different 3D formats, and to explore potential applications in traffic modeling of 3D video formats and in the creation of improved transport techniques for video smoothing and statistical multiplexing. Algorithms and software implementations for mathematical methods in the field of complex systems and chaos were created in Matlab and Python, for the determination of fractal properties (the aggregated variance method, the R/S statistical method, and the multiscale method) and multifractal properties (the method of moments for multifractal spectra and estimation of the generalized dimensions and the histogram method for multifractal spectra and inverse multifractal analysis). Based on the findings, the fractal and multifractal properties of 3D video formats are verified, and a comparison is conducted for various 3D video formats, video structures, frame types, encoder quantization parameter values, frame aggregation, and video streaming methods.
