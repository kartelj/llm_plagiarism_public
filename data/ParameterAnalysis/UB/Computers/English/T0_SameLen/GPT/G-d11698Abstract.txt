Gamma scintillation cameras (GSC) are utilized in the medical field for examining the distribution of radiopharmaceuticals that are injected, inhaled or ingested. The evolution of integrated circuit technology has impacted the construction of GSC’s head and the flexibility, speed, cost and expandability of GSC’s systems for image acquisition, storage and analysis. Despite the digital GSCs era starting in the 1980s, many nuclear medical centres still operate analogue or semi-analogue GSCs with fully functional mechanics and scintillation crystals, which are essential for nuclear imaging. The ideal solution is to digitize GSC and integrate it with contemporary computer systems. Digitizing analogue and semi-analogue GSCs ensures: 1) continued use of old GSCs and delay in purchasing new equipment; 2) application of the best available analysis of nuclear-medical studies (in line with Evidence Based Medicine, EBM principles); 3) testing and development of new analysis techniques to enhance patient treatment, if the system architecture is “open”. The objective of the research presented in this doctoral thesis is to develop a computer system (GammaKey system) that provides functionality (acquisition, storage and image processing) to semi-analogue GSCs, is compatible and can also be used with modern digital systems, and has an open architecture that allows the development and clinical application of new diagnostic techniques. The GammaKey system meets the following requirements: 1) easy replacement of the original computer system (e.g. MicroDELTA, Siemens Gammasonics Inc., Ilinois, USA) with the new configuration – a simple connection to GSC and minimal training due to the intuitive Windows graphical interface; 2) reliability – meets the quality standards of nuclear medical instrumentation defined by National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA), no loss of patient and study information, accurate and precise production of results; 3) compatibility with other (non)medical systems by using standard data formats (JPEG, BITMAP, ASCII, DICOM) and data synchronization between two workstations viii (the first one for acquisition, storage and processing, the second one only for image processing); 4) quick, simple and inexpensive upgrade to new generations of computers and analog-to-digital convertors (ADC) – enabled by using LabVIEW software environment (National Instruments, Teksas, SAD) and commercial National Instruments ADC; 5) development and implementation of novel non-standard acquisition protocols and tools for study processing. The basic configuration of the GammaKey system includes: 1) standard functions for image processing (resampling to the matrix 1024x1024 pixels by bilinear interpolation, nine-point smoothing, Butterworth and Winer filter); 2) tools for image manipulation (zoom, contrast adjustment, deleting parts of the image that are not of interest); 3) standard functions for scintigraphic study processing (up to 10 regions of interest (ROI), calculating time-activity-curves (TAC), frame and TAC arithmetic operations, N-point median and cubic spline TAC filtering, automatic ROI segmentation of static studies, ROI radioactivity correction). The advanced configuration of the GammaKey system includes three non-standard features: 1) EffSpleen acquisition and analysis for efficacy of the splenectomy prediction in patients with chronic immune thrombocytopenic purpura; 2) Submarine analysis for localization of parathyroid tumors; 3) SalivaryScan analysis for complete quantitative investigation of salivary glands function. The EffSpleen routine allows complete acquisition and analysis of in vivo examination of platelet kinetics to estimate splenectomy efficacy according to the method developed in the Center for Nuclear Medicine, Clinical Center of Serbia, Belgrade. This developed routine enables the automation of time-consuming processing of sequential static studies and calculation of platelet sequestration index. The Submarine routine is the implementation of the original method for the localization of parathyroid tumors based on dynamic parathyroid scintigrams, developed in collaboration with physicians from the National Cancer Research Center of Serbia, Belgrade. The evaluation of the Submarine method is presented in the group of patients with histopathologically proven parathyroid tumors and its efficacy has been demonstrated for localization of hyperplasia and parathyroid lesions covered by thyroid nodules, solving typical pitfalls of standard subtraction protocol. Algorithms for visualization and automatic extraction of regions with parathyroid lesions are suggested. The SalivaryScan routine enables automatic calculation of 11 quantitative indices that ix describe the function of salivary glands, unlike commercial software that usually provides only one parameter (ejection fraction). A significant modification of secretion velocity index is introduced. This developed tool is a basic instrument for further multidisciplinary research in the field of salivary scintigraphy. An example of a nephrology clinical study based on studies acquired by the realized system is also presented, where the analysis is done in a third-party application developed by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). The GammaKey system enables the continuity of basic clinical practice, as well as following modern trends, continuity in research, defining valid reference values and the possibility of validation of other applications. All these facts describe the system that fully supports the EBM concept. The GammaKey system has been used in daily clinical practice in two leading medical centers in Serbia: Clinical Center of Vojvodina in Novi Sad (since 2005, Center for Clinical Laboratory Medicine, Nuclear Medical Department, http://www.kcv.rs) and Clinical Center of Serbia in Belgrade (since 2007, Center for Nuclear Medicine, Neurology, Urology and Endocrinology Departments, http://www.kcs.ac.rs). The EffSpleen protocol has been used in the Clinical Center of Serbia (Nuclear Haematology Department) since 2008 (more than 250 patients). The Submarine routine has been used in the National Cancer Research Center of Serbia, Belgrade, Serbia, for diagnostic and research purposes since 2012 (more than 100 patients, including retroactive analysis since 2008.). More than 30 000 patients have been examined using the GammaKey system (more than 10 000 patients at the Clinical Center of Vojvodina and more than 20 000 patients at the Clinical Center of Serbia).
