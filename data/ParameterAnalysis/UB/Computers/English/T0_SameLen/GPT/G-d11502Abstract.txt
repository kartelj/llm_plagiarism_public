The well-documented performance bottleneck of SIMD (Single-Instruction Multiple-Data) processors for image and video processing is accessing pixels in memory. This thesis introduces a new parallel on-chip memory subsystem solution, inclusive of new functionalities and a supportive architecture, which allows for increased processing throughput and less energy consumption per processed pixel compared to other cutting-edge subsystems.

The thesis initially introduces new functionalities of a parallel memory subsystem, namely new block and row access modes, which are more suited to the requirements of image and video processing algorithms than the functionalities of current parallel memory subsystems. These new access modes significantly decrease the number of on-chip memory read and write accesses, thereby speeding up the imaging/video kernels that are the focus of this work: sub-pixel block-matching motion estimation, pixel interpolation for motion compensation, and spatial window-based filtering. The primary concept of the new access modes is to utilize spatial overlaps of blocks/rows accessed in the memory subsystem, which are known at the subsystem design-time, and combine multiple accesses into a single one by accessing slightly more pixels at a time than with other parallel memories. To circumvent the need for a wider, and thus more expensive SIMD datapath, this work suggests new memory read operations that divide all pixels accessed at a time into multiple SIMD-wide blocks/rows, in a convenient manner for further processing. In addition to a higher processing throughput, the new access modes decrease the energy consumed by the parallel memory subsystem for the same quantity of processed pixels, by reducing the number of repeated accesses of the same pixels.

Secondly, as a proof of concept and for the completeness of the proposed solution, the thesis outlines a parametric, scalable, and cost-efficient architecture that supports the new access modes, as well as access modes of existing parallel memory subsystems. The architecture is based on: 1) a previously proposed set of memory banks with multiple pixels per addressable word of a bank, 2) a previously proposed shifted scheme for arranging pixels in the banks that enables parallel access to all pixels of a block/row, and 3) control logic that implements the shifted scheme in the memory banks and the access modes, and thus provides a convenient and efficient programming interface.

The benefits of the proposed parallel memory subsystem solution are analytically and experimentally demonstrated on a case study of the well-known 3DRS sub-pixel block-matching motion estimation algorithm, commonly used for real-time frame-rate conversion during video playback. The implemented block-matcher, based on the proposed parallel memory subsystem, can process 3840*2160 video at the rate of 60 frames per second, while clocked at 600 MHz. Compared to the block-matcher implementations based on the six state-of-the-art subsystems and the same SIMD datapath, this work enables 40 – 70% higher throughput, consumes 17 – 44% less energy, and has similar silicon area and off-chip memory bandwidth costs. That is 1.8 – 2.9 times more efficient than the previous state-of-the-art, calculated as the ratio between the achieved processing throughput and the product of all costs: energy consumption, silicon area, and off-chip memory bandwidth. Such a high efficiency is the result of the new access modes and the cost-effective architecture, which reduced the number of on-chip memory accesses by 1.6 – 2.1 times.

Due to its demonstrated efficiency, the proposed parallel memory subsystem is used in the most recent and most advanced Intel processors and systems-on-chip for imaging and video processing on mobile devices. Moreover, it is being continuously improved for use in future generations of Intel processors.
