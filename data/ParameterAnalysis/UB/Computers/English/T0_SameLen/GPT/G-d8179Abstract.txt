This thesis explores the creation and use of an interoperable e-Business model for payment systems, based on ontologies and the Resource-Event-Agent - REA (ISO/IEC 15944-4:2007) ontological object system structure. The research is grounded in referential models for information exchange according to global financial industry standards. It will utilize insights and expertise from the implementation of the Check Clearing and Direct Debit systems within the Association of Serbian Banks, developed using Enterprise Integration Patterns (EIP) and standardized message systems. The research will be tailored to the implementation of interoperable payment systems in Serbia. Various payment systems interact with different participants' business systems during electronic transactions. These business systems cater to numerous users and business processes with unique requirements. The main issue is the disparity between business processes, data, and IT technologies, leading to wasted time, financial, and informatics resources in data transfer between systems. Nowadays, electronic financial transactions have become the norm, necessitating the development of interoperable e-Business models for payment systems for transaction exchange and processing. The standardization of payment system modeling, as discussed in this study, should enhance the efficiency of other electronic business systems and the interoperability of participants' electronic businesses. Each country's payment system includes various payment instruments, banking procedures, and fund transfer systems between financial institutions, facilitating money circulation. The Central Bank directly controls and regulates money flow and oversees payment systems. The most crucial is the Real Time Gross Settlement System - RTGS, primarily under Central Bank supervision. Banks' systems and other financial institutions' systems connect via the RTGS System. This includes institutions like clearing houses, payment agents, processing houses, and others, legally defined and involved in implementation, processing, information gathering, or distribution related to financial transactions and other electronic business systems. Payment systems, as described in this work, consolidate elements present in every message-based system, technological elements of supervising institutions, dictated by the standard message format, environmental conditions imposed by the location with the implemented payment system (in financial vertical, with the type of processing it is committed to, geopolitical typology, and other possible elements), necessary communication interaction, and information technologies required for accomplishing general and specific tasks. Ontologies, as formal descriptions of objects, their characteristics, and relationships in a specific domain, are explicitly understandable to humans and computers. In this work, the ontological approach provides interoperability and consistency in the model and enhances the model's design from the knowledge domain. The ISO 15944-4:2007 standard, which will be examined in this study, establishes the ontological foundation for specifying the concepts and relations included in business transactions and scenarios known as the Resource-Event-Agent â€“ REA ontology.
