The doctoral thesis focuses on the information society field, its progression, and methods for monitoring and measuring its growth. It compiles existing studies and theories on the subject of the information society, its evolution, various forms, growth determinants, and numerous global initiatives aimed at steering the worldwide progress of the information society. The thesis explores ways to quantify the information society, a complex concept defined by a group of interrelated indicators, and investigates the most suitable metrics for observing, measuring, and assessing the current state of the information society. Besides providing a classification and evolution path of the benchmarking indicators that form the foundation of any methodology for quantifying the information society, the thesis includes a review of the most relevant methodologies used globally for evaluating the information society. However, the primary focus of this work is the creation of a unique model that outlines the necessary steps to monitor and assess the advancements in Serbia's information society. This model assumes: • a theoretical foundation, • compatibility with European Union (EU) standards, allowing for its widespread use in international cross-country analysis and comparison projects, • adherence to the specificities of Serbia's information society and Serbia's existing investment and development opportunities. The model's formulation included: • selecting a set of Information Society Indicators (ISI) in line with EU standards, but modified to suit Serbia's characteristics and development potential, • transforming the ISI set to enable their ranking based on their importance for monitoring the information society, • extracting a subset of the most relevant ISI, • defining a sub-model that quantifies the digital divide degree through a unique compound indicator - the Digital Polarization Index (DPI). The model was tested on Serbia, monitoring and analyzing its information society over five years. The verification process involved: • statistical monitoring, quantification, and relevant data analysis, and • analyzing the results to determine the current state, identify and quantify 'critical points' in Serbia's information society development, and predict its future progress. The thesis's professional contribution is the evaluation of Serbia's information society development from both the population and economy's perspectives. Additionally, the thesis contributes by quantifying and assessing the intensity of the digital divide and its trends, and by targeting the most digitally underdeveloped groups within Serbia's population. The primary scientific contribution is the creation of a model for monitoring and evaluating the information society's development. This model is based on the I-distance method and cluster analysis, two appropriately combined multivariate analysis methods. The initial set of indicators was reduced to a subset of the most relevant ones, ranked according to their I-distance value and the application of cluster analysis. This subset includes the most significant indicators for assessing the information society, based on the 'information quantity'. By reducing the number of indicators while maintaining valuable information content, the model's practical applicability has significantly increased. Additionally, the thesis defines a model for quantifying individual and total digital divide in various areas, introducing the digital polarization index. The model's main features are its generality, flexibility, and openness for adding or changing its basic components. This allows for the identification, definition, and calculation of various individual sub-indices of digital polarization, used in calculating the total DPI (expressed by arbitrarily selected sets of indicators and arbitrarily determined subgroups of the sample). These model features are valuable in terms of its applicability in the rapidly changing ICT area. The thesis's social contribution is the vast potential for applying its results in monitoring and quantifying the information society, as well as in guiding and harmonizing its development. The model can be used as a strategic decision support tool and a tool for observing and minimizing the digital divide. It can also support the evaluation of different complex social phenomena outside the information society framework.
