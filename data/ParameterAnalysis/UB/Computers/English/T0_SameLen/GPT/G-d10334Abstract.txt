This research's primary goal is to suggest and empirically test a comprehensive model of retail consumer loyalty in Serbia. A literature review on crucial factors influencing service customer loyalty, such as service quality, satisfaction, and perceived value, preceded the main research. The research was conducted using a structured survey on a convenience sample of 737 retail consumers in non-specialised, predominantly food stores, employing multivariate data analysis techniques, executed through SPSS 18 and LISREL 8.80 software packages. The results of exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis reveal the multidimensional nature of the service quality construct in the Serbian retail context. Four dimensions of retail service quality were identified: (F1) Employee behaviour and appearance, (F2) Atmospherics, (F3) Customer communication, and (F4) Spatial layout and assortment. Structural equation modelling showed customer satisfaction as the most crucial determinant of customer loyalty, followed by perceived value, which had both direct and indirect effects on loyalty, mediated through satisfaction. The research also shows a significant influence of service quality on customer loyalty. Although this latent variable did not have a statistically significant direct effect on customer loyalty, it indirectly influenced customer loyalty through the mediating variables of satisfaction and perceived value. The research results highlight the need to measure and enhance customer satisfaction and perceived value, as well as service quality, to build a loyal customer base. As the research was conducted on a convenience sample of retail customers, future studies should focus on developing a service quality scale and measuring customer satisfaction and perceived value on a representative sample of Serbian retail customers.
