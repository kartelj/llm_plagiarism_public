The initial section of this thesis provides an examination of the routing protocols within data center topologies. Focus is placed on two-phase routing protocols that facilitate congestion avoidance in data center topologies, which are consistent and offer a substantial number of alternative routes. This thesis introduces a new two-phase routing algorithm, LB-ECR, that enhances the efficiency of data center networks. By employing linear programming, LB-ECR optimizes the loss-free throughput for the specified traffic demand of the switches. LB-ECR is grounded on ECMP routing, which is prevalent in data centers due to its use of alternative equal-cost routes. Two-phase balancing simplifies the linear model by removing traffic flows and reduces congestion likelihood by spreading traffic across less utilized links. Simplifying the linear model eases its solution for large data centers. The initial section of this thesis provides a summary of the network topologies and the routing in data centers, and a performance comparison of various routing algorithms in typical data center topologies.
Besides routing optimization, this thesis investigates the algorithms for updating the lookup tables of Internet routers. The second section of this thesis offers a summary of the lookup and update algorithms. The updating performance of two advanced lookup algorithms is scrutinized. We formulate equations for the worst-case memory requirements for two quick lookup algorithms, while we demonstrate through simulations the memory requirements for typical routing tables. We also assess the number of memory accesses to the lookup modules during updates, the complexity of the updating algorithms, and their execution time for typical routing tables.
The final section of this thesis includes a description of the implementations of the two-phase routing algorithms and of the lookup update algorithms, as well as the integration of these components within the router.
