'Digital image compression and coding aim to reduce the memory resources required for displaying, storing, and transmitting digital images. Compression techniques result in significant savings. Rapid algorithms and structures for compression and decompression are crucial in applications needing real-time performance. Current methods for digital image compression with high compression ratios are slow, necessitating complex processors and large amounts of high bandwidth memory, while also increasing power usage. Both processing time and memory capacity grow as the compression ratio rises. In this doctoral thesis, we tackled the issue of hardware implementation of a codec that minimizes necessary memory resources, is quick, and has a high compression ratio. The goal was achieved using a combination of scientific methods. The reduction of necessary memory resources is accomplished through optimized nonstationary filters and a novel two-dimensional subband transformation algorithm, as well as a single pass implementation of probability estimators. The operation speed is attained through a single pass algorithm for probability estimation and the fact that the input image is not partially processed. The high compression ratio is obtained through the combined effects of all subsystems in the implementation: subband transformer, quantizer, single pass probability estimator, and entropy encoder. The hardware implementation from this thesis has been validated through an image compression system with a network interface. It is demonstrated that it is feasible to implement a complete color image encoder within a low-cost programmable logic device, without any external memory components.
