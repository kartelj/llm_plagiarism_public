Content created by users on web forums is more frequently added than removed or altered, making its targeting during incremental crawling distinct from the crawling of website pages. The addition of new content to a forum may cause existing content to be relocated to new or existing pages. Incremental forum crawling is a complex task, as neglecting the manner in which content is displayed, distributed, and organized can result in the transfer of posts that were indexed in previous crawl cycles. Moreover, there is a broad range of forum technologies that provide various navigational routes to the most recent posts and diverse methods of displaying and organizing user-generated content.

This dissertation introduces the Structure-driven Incremental Forum crawler (SInFo), which specializes in targeting the most recent content in incremental forum crawling using advanced optimization techniques and machine learning. The primary objective of the system presented is to bypass content that has already been indexed in new crawl cycles, regardless of its technology. To accomplish this, the following Web Forum features were utilized: (1) the sorting method on the index and thread pages, and (2) the available navigational routes between the pages offered by the current Web Forum technology. Since the date of content creation is crucial in determining the sort type, detecting and normalizing it is not a simple task. Machine learning models were employed for this task, as the generated dates can be in various formats and languages. Conversely, the detection of navigational routes is accomplished by interpreting the URL format and scanning the targeted pages.

It has been proven that using the proposed methods and techniques to target pages with the most recent content can minimize the number of duplicate content downloads and maximize the use of the navigational structure and routes of the current forum technology. The experiments were conducted on a wide variety of existing popular forum technologies as well as on individual stand-alone forum technologies. SInFo has shown high precision and a minimum number of duplicate content transfers in each new crawl cycle. Most of the duplicates that the proposed system encountered are from pages that had to be visited to accurately determine the navigational route or to find the appropriate URL. Additionally, machine learning models, despite their complexity, performed well during crawling and have high accuracy in date detection and normalization, achieving an F1-measure of 99%.
