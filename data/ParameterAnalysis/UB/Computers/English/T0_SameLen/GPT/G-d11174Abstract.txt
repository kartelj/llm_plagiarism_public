Managerial control is deemed a crucial tool for management, executing corporate strategy, and enhancing a company's business. The effectiveness of this control largely hinges on the information given to decision-makers – data on past accomplishments and forecasts of an organization's future standing and profits. Assessing past and predicting future achievements are areas explored within business performance measurement systems. Thus, creating a new or applying an existing system for business performance measurement is a vital foundation for successful decision-making. To meet managerial information needs, managerial accountants and experts from various managerial fields have endeavored to establish principles, concepts, techniques, and procedures for developing business performance measurement systems. In addition to conceptual and procedural matters, current studies also tackle the challenges of developing specific business performance measurement systems. Despite over a decade of tradition in discussing these matters, the development and application of business performance measurement systems are still in their infancy. Consequently, both academia and management practice view them as a hot topic, sparking lively debate on the ideal system for business performance measurement. This doctoral thesis aims to build a new system for business performance measurement. A specific goal is to identify factors influencing the system's construction – the number of performance measures to be included in the system, and how the system should be used. A fundamental theory defining this dissertation's scope is the contingency theory in management accounting. Therefore, the study identified a range of factors that determine the diversity and use of the performance measurement system. Subsequently, the impact of performance measurement systems on organizational (financial and nonfinancial) success was investigated. Primary data from the empirical study were used to validate the theoretical model. To the author's best knowledge, this type of study has never been conducted in Serbia before. Outside Serbia, only a partial test of a contingency factor's influence on business performance systems was conducted, but never as comprehensively and in the form presented in this doctoral thesis. The findings suggest that Serbian companies use a relatively broad range of performance measures. The factors defined in the theoretical model influence both the diversity and use of performance measurement systems. However, their significance varies considerably. Also, the balanced use of financial and nonfinancial performance indicators significantly impacts business success. These findings could be beneficial to other researchers in the fields of performance measurement, management control, and management accounting. Furthermore, the findings are extremely useful for practitioners – consultants and managers – in building performance measurement systems in specific companies.
