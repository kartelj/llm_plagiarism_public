In the Introduction section, we establish our research area and primary objectives, highlight key hypotheses and research methods, and present an overview and detailed explanation of the dissertation, emphasizing significant aspects of our work. The second section is dedicated to the concept of efficiency and methods for assessing and quantifying efficiency. The efficiency principle is a crucial component of modern business decision-making (Savić, 2011). Efficiency is defined as the ability to minimize input to achieve maximum results (Amado et al., 2011). For organizations that use one input to produce one output, efficiency is calculated as output divided by input. However, the real challenge arises when measuring the efficiency of organizational systems that utilize various types of inputs to produce different outputs (Thanassoulis et al., 2012). The primary objective of this research was to develop a new statistical model of efficiency capable of handling different types of input/output variables. Therefore, it is essential to consolidate all indicators into a single value. The challenge is to overcome the fact that variables are measured in different units and to provide suitable weighting factors. Data Envelopment Analysis – DEA, a commonly used method, will be explained. The DEA method was created by Charnes, Cooper & Rhodes (1978) to measure the efficiency of organizational units, particularly non-profit ones. The method's creator proposed a nonparametric approach to efficiency evaluation. The approach was based on the concept of integrating multiple inputs and outputs into a single virtual input and output. The weighting issue was resolved by allowing each Decision Making Unit (DMU) to determine its own weights, with the aim of maximizing its efficiency. The only restriction was that weights had to be a positive number, and the ratio of virtual outputs to virtual inputs could not exceed 1 (Martić, 1999). In addition to the DEA method for measuring efficiency, the dissertation also discussed Stochastic Frontier Analysis (SFA). This is an alternative approach to measuring efficiency that extensively uses econometric models. In the third chapter, the focus shifts to the concept of multivariate data analysis. This term refers to the multivariate aspect of data analysis, where many observations are collected on a large number of variables. Multivariate data analysis allows us to analyze complex data sets with many interdependent and independent variables. The third chapter of the dissertation primarily focuses on two key statistical methods: principal component analysis (PCA) & factor analysis, and cluster analysis. Factor analysis and PCA are commonly used to identify a relatively small number of factors that represent complex interrelationships between all variables. These methods are very useful in identifying hidden dimensions of observed phenomena. The main difference between these two methods is the way they examine data. Factor analysis is primarily concerned with covariance, while PCA examines variances. Both methods have similar objectives and procedures, so factor analysis can be considered a special case of PCA (Bulajić, 2002). Significant attention is also given to cluster analysis as a method of multivariate data analysis. It is frequently used to group objects, so that similar objects form a group that is distinct from other groups. Objects are clustered based on similarity, which is defined in many different ways. The basic idea of the dissertation was to create a new statistical efficiency model based on the I-distance method. Therefore, the fourth chapter focuses on the I-distance metrics in n-dimensional space, proposed and defined by Prof. Dr. Branislav Ivanović (Ivanović 1972, 1973, 1977; Ivanović & Fanchette, 1973). As one of the leading experts in the Statistical Department of the United Nations (UN) and its agencies such as UNCTAD and FAO (United Nations Conference on Trade and Development – UNCTAD; Food and Agriculture Agency - FAO), Prof. Ivanović developed this method to rank countries based on a large number of variables. Various socio-economic indicators were considered, and the key challenge was how to use all of them to create a single synthesized indicator that would represent the rank. The proposed solution was based on creating a fictitious entity with the minimum values for each indicator/variable and measuring the distance of other entities in the observed data set from the fictitious entity. With the help of the coefficient of partial correlation, a rank list is formed. The I-distance fulfills all 13 conditions to be declared as a metric. A key argument for using the I-distance method is its ability to integrate a large number of different measured variables into a single value. In the dissertation, special attention was paid to the applications of the I-distance method. Probably the most significant application was the use of the I-distance method to rank the world's best universities according to the Academic Ranking of World Universities – ARWU and SCImago methodologies (Scopus Journal Ranking). The improved I-distance method was highlighted as a major contribution to the issue, as it easily overcomes the problem of subjectively assigned weighting factors for variables/indicators. In addition to these applications, the dissertation presents the issue of evaluating the socio-economic development of countries, the health of nations, and the ranking of sports teams. All of these case studies have been verified in leading scientific journals. The fifth chapter is based on a new statistical efficiency model based on the I-distance method. In the dissertation, this model is called Distance Based Analysis – DBA, and it has been verified through many examples published in leading journals. The DBA method was used to measure the efficiency of university scientific output, the banking sector, the health sector, and the efficiency of regions in Serbia. The proposed method provided interesting results and insights, which were later verified using the DEA method. The dissertation significantly improved the corpus of methods for measuring efficiency. The dissertation also made significant progress in the I-distance method, as the algorithm for selecting the first solution of the method and the order of variable inclusion was significantly improved. Since the idea of the I-distance method is to integrate many different types of measurement variables into a single value, it is essential that the I-distance covers the maximum amount of information. In the dissertation, we showed that the initial solution based on the sum of absolute correlations converges to the final solution fairly quickly. The suggested improved method provides better results, as the obtained solution incorporates the maximum amount of input variables/indicators. The improvement of the method is reflected in the smaller number of steps needed for the final solution to appear. Finally, a conclusion with responses to each research question and hypothesis was provided. A systematic presentation of the scientific contributions and possibilities for further research was also elaborated. Extensive literature is provided, and the Appendix includes results from an experiment to improve the I-distance method.
