Parallel knowledge tests, which contain varying sets of items with roughly equal measurement properties, are interchangeable and can be used when multiple examinees are taking the test, regardless of timing. The test results must be comparable. Automating the parallel test assembly process is essential for maintaining objectivity by balancing the measurement properties of different test forms and minimizing subjective errors by the examiner. The larger the testing scale, the more significant the time savings for the examiner in preparing parallel tests through automated assembly. The automated parallel test assembly problem (APTA) is a NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem, necessitating the use of heuristics. The APTA problem is isomorphic with some existing combinatorial optimization problems, so heuristics for solving those problems can also be used for the APTA problem. The dissertation presents a comprehensive review of existing problem formulations, mathematical models, and an overview of the heuristics used for solving different problem formulations. Problem formulations and heuristic solutions are classified independently, then cross-classified to identify new combinations of problem formulations and heuristics for their solution. The heuristics used to solve ASPT problems are primarily improvement heuristics, which are interrupted when a predetermined execution time occurs or when the desired solution quality is reached. Constructive heuristics are mainly used to create an initial solution for improvement heuristics. The dissertation proposes a new efficient method of polynomial complexity for completely solving the APTA problem. The proposed method solves one formulation of the bin packing problem by adapting the constructive heuristic proposed by Nawaz, Enschore and Ham, which has not been used for the APTA problem before. The new method is characterized by predictable execution time, efficiency, and ease of implementation. Predictable time and efficient test assembly is particularly important in educational institutions where frequent testing of a relatively small number of examinees is performed, and where the available computer resources for ASPT are limited. The proposed APTA method has been implemented and compared to efficient comparable methods based on improvement heuristics, such as simulated annealing (SA) and variable neighbourhood search (VNS). In open literature, the VNS method provides the best quality results for the APTA problem formulated as the bin packing problem. The execution time of the proposed algorithm is significantly shorter compared to the SA algorithm, while the quality is negligibly worse. Compared to the VNS algorithm, the average execution time is significantly shorter, while for the same execution time (achieved by interrupting the execution of the VNS algorithm), the proposed new algorithm achieves a better quality of result for the case of a relatively small number of parallel tests (20, 30 and 60) and relatively small item banks (300 items), which are often found in knowledge tests in education institutions.
