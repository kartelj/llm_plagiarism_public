This thesis introduces a unique system for visualizing cryptographic algorithms, known as CryptOgraphic Algorithms visuaL simulAtion (COALA). The primary objective of this system is to assist newcomers to data security in comprehending the basics of cryptographic algorithms, which form the foundation for more complex topics. The University of Belgrade's School of Electrical Engineering offers a Data Security course that covers everything from cryptographic algorithms to system security. Exam results revealed that students struggled with the cryptographic algorithms section, which negatively affected their overall performance. After investigating the causes of this issue, it was concluded that incorporating a visual representation system for cryptographic algorithms into the course's lab exercises could be a solution. Such systems are commonly used in computer engineering and information systems courses that teach software-related subjects. Before developing a new system, existing solutions were analyzed to determine if a system that meets the Data Security course's needs already exists and to define the characteristics such a system should have to be effective as a teaching aid. Despite the abundance of algorithm visualization systems (AV systems), only a few can visualize cryptographic algorithms, and none fully meet the Data Security course's needs. A methodology for developing such a system is proposed, based on a systematic review of existing algorithm visualization systems, with a particular focus on those capable of visualizing cryptographic algorithms. An efficient method for using the developed system in the educational process is defined through a literature review on eLearning tools. The system allows for a detailed analysis of all cryptographic algorithms discussed in lectures and problem classes. It displays all details of the supported algorithms' execution, emphasizing the system's ability to work with real-world algorithm parameter lengths. All input parameters in the algorithms are configurable, allowing for easy and quick demonstration of algorithm execution on various examples. The thesis includes several overviews: eLearning tools, AV systems, and systems for visualizing cryptographic algorithms. It also describes the cryptographic algorithms supported by the COALA system, which include five different types: substitution, transposition, production, symmetric block, and public-key algorithms. Special attention is given to explaining the visual representation used in the COALA system. The thesis presents a detailed functional description and software implementation details of the COALA system.
