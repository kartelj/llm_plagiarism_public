The use of biometric technologies in our modern society is becoming increasingly common, to the point where we can almost say that they are a part of our daily lives. When deploying biometric authentication, each system has unique requirements and limitations, which are dependent on the specific scenario in which the system is utilized. To select the appropriate biometric modality and a suitable algorithm for that modality, an assessment of the biometric system's performance is required. However, this assessment is not always straightforward. This is true for both unimodal and multimodal biometric systems. Even when open biometric databases are accessible for assessment, it is necessary to modify the system to comply with the testing protocol of the selected open database. Furthermore, if the biometric system employs multiple biometric modalities, the evaluation becomes even more complex due to the variety of fusion algorithms available. To address these challenges, this thesis introduces a unified multimodal biometric systems evaluation model, as there is no detailed model of multimodal biometric systems in the relevant literature. The proposed model is based on the MDA (Model Driven Architecture) paradigm. A component of the unified multimodal biometric systems evaluation model is the metamodel of multimodal biometric system evaluation, which constitutes an ontology of terms used in this field. A prototype framework for multimodal biometrics systems evaluation has been developed based on the unified multimodal biometric systems evaluation model. The proposed framework allows for the evaluation of multimodal biometric system performance in various use cases. Experimental evaluation results, based on the utilized database and algorithms, demonstrate that the framework reduces the time needed for evaluation to a quarter of the previously required time. Additionally, a new analytical method for biometric system threshold optimization, based on predefined desired system behavior, was developed. Lastly, a learning tool based on some of the framework's functionalities is used to demonstrate how the framework can enhance the efficiency of training engineers in the field of biometrics.
