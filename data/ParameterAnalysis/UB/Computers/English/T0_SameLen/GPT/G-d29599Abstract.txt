This doctoral dissertation's primary focus is to investigate the potential of virtual worlds for research and education applications. It explores two main aspects. The first aspect examines the idea of autonomous agents and general agent theory within virtual worlds. The second aspect pertains to the educational uses of virtual worlds, with a particular emphasis on virtual laboratories. The dissertation begins with an explanation of basic terminology related to the topic. It then presents a comprehensive analysis of agents' roles in virtual worlds, including an examination of the techniques that influence agent behavior. The dissertation also presents the development of a virtual gamified educational system specifically for agents, complete with a detailed description. Finally, it analyzes the concept of virtual laboratories in Science, Technology, and Engineering (STE) disciplines and evaluates existing solutions based on the dissertation's defined criteria.
