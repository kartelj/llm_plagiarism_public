Continuous education and ongoing training are fundamental paradigms of modern society's progress, rooted in technological advancement and global commerce. The pace of education and learning has accelerated, driven by the evolution of IT and technological progress, leading to new scientific knowledge and applications, as well as the emergence of new scientific fields. In the early 21st century, a new scientific field emerged, business intelligence, which seeks to uncover data relationships in the field of education - Educational Data Mining. This field focuses on developing methods for analyzing and determining the validity of data from the education sector and using these methods to better understand student behavior and facilitate teaching progress. The focus of this PhD thesis is the potential application of business intelligence in education, with the aim of identifying key factors in student success to enhance the higher education process. The thesis seeks to identify the most significant variables of a student, from their background and high school performance, to their success in the first year of undergraduate studies, and their correlation with overall academic success. The ability to accurately predict success at the end of studies using business intelligence methods, techniques, and tools is the central focus of the dissertation. The thesis examines current research and knowledge in the field of educational data mining, particularly in higher education, and proposes a new approach and method for predicting performance indicators in higher education institutions. The dissertation also proposes an original software solution â€“ an application for analyzing, monitoring, and predicting undergraduate student success, as part of an integrated knowledge and information exchange portal between students and faculty. By applying business intelligence methods and techniques, the developed models were implemented to predict study success and verify the results using the student database of the Faculty of Organizational Sciences, University of Belgrade. The PhD dissertation is divided into 12 chapters. The introductory chapter presents the objectives, hypotheses, and research and dissertation implementation plan. The following two chapters introduce the basic concepts of business intelligence and data mining, including an analysis and systematization of knowledge and extensive research literature on data mining in higher education. The fourth chapter outlines the projected research model, particularly the software support used for research implementation, and the sources and data structures used. The fifth chapter applies descriptive and comparative analysis concepts for a detailed definition of data structures, mutual dependencies, and correlations within the data. Chapters six to eight introduce the development of a predictive model in RapidMiner, Clementine, and Matlab software environments, using regression, decision trees, support vector machines, and artificial neural networks. The ninth chapter provides a comparative analysis of the previously developed prediction model performance and identifies attributes influencing study success. The tenth chapter presents the basic structure and functionality of the information system for analyzing and monitoring higher education performance. The eleventh chapter provides concluding remarks and summarizes the key results, as well as basic guidelines for further development and improvement of predictive models. The dissertation concludes with the twelfth chapter, which provides a bibliography overview. The dissertation includes two appendices. The first appendix provides a detailed specification of cases where the developed information system for analyzing and monitoring study performance is used. The second appendix presents a detailed user interface presentation, with synthetic and analytical data analysis about performance and success influencing factors. The dissertation presents a comprehensive research project in this area, applying business intelligence methods and techniques to analyze and predict undergraduate student success. This can also represent and support effective higher education management at institutions aiming to improve the educational process implementation. The developed models should assist professors in early identification of students they can work with, students who aspire to continuous training and advanced education, and students who need extra or additional training to improve and enhance their knowledge. The model may be useful to students, providing insight into predictable university success based on existing learning, working, and evaluation habits. It could also benefit companies seeking to timely identify students as potential future apprentices or employees. The thesis's final result is the recommendation of using 14 models that achieve over 90% accuracy in predicting the average study grade, the average study length, or a professional course assessment in the fourth study year, as well as the established factors and variables crucial for determining academic success. The research results will assist in analyzing the issue of further introducing systems and models for predicting student success in higher education institutions, as well as determining detailed requirements future students should meet to achieve more and be more successful. The survey results can also be used by other higher education systems (e.g., Master academic studies) with minimal upgrades and updates, all aiming to promote and improve the entire academic education process. An integrated system for monitoring undergraduate student success has been developed, which can assist higher education institutions in making informed decisions and directing training in the optimal direction when creating the curriculum. The research results presented in the thesis will help bring educational data mining closer to researchers in Serbia, as well as begin the process of introducing systems and models for predicting student success in higher education institutions.
