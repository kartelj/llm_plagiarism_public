Wireless mesh networks (WMNs) represent a fresh development in wireless communications, offering enhanced flexibility, dependability, and superior network performance compared to traditional wireless local area networks. Considering the escalating need for swift and effective data transfer and multimedia transmission (voice and video), the primary challenges in WMN design are boosting throughput (by incorporating a multi-channel multi-interface (MCMI) approach into the WMN), and considering the quality of service (QoS). To attain optimal network performance, it's crucial to establish protocols and routing metrics that identify the best path between the source and destination node. Given the high signal dynamics of the WMN, particularly in complex environments (from a radio coverage perspective), such as indoor settings, this dissertation proposes routing metrics that can quickly adapt to changes in propagation conditions at each network link. The link costs of the three new metrics, powerETX (Expected Transmission Count), powerWCETT (Weighted Cumulative Expected Transmission Time) and powerMIC (Metric of Interference and Channel-switching), in addition to the parameters defined in the existing ETX, WCETT and MIC metrics, incorporate a parameter dependent on the received signal level. Compared to existing metrics, these new metrics offer higher data throughput and reduced average end-to-end delay, and can be implemented without additional hardware and minimal software modifications. Recognizing that current channel assignment (CA) algorithms lack QoS support in MCMI-WMNs and that multimedia transmission can experience unacceptable delays, this dissertation proposes a new link layer protocol, QoS-HMCP (QoS Hybrid Multi-Channel Protocol), which introduces QoS support via the EDCA (Enhanced Distributed Channel Access) mechanism, and leverages the positive attributes of the hybrid CA algorithm defined by the HMCP protocol for the link layer. Four versions of the QoS-HMCP protocols, considering different channel switching criteria and medium competition procedures, are proposed. These versions are compared to the basic HMCP protocol in terms of user data throughput and network delay, and the results validate the introduction of QoS support into the MCMI network. Ultimately, a side-by-side comparison of the proposed versions concludes which version of the QoS-HMCP protocol yields the best results (highest throughput with least delay), and for which traffic categories and network conditions. Additionally, this dissertation contributes a comprehensive and systematic review of existing routing protocols, channel assignment strategies, and routing metrics for multi-channel multi-interface WMNs.
