Modern society's progression largely hinges on superior telecommunications networks. Ensuring these networks maintain high availability is crucial, as it directly impacts the services' availability to end users. Presently, backbone networks typically consist of numerous nodes (dozens), making direct availability calculations challenging due to the exponential increase in algorithm execution time with the addition of nodes and links. Hence, the practical significance of approximation algorithms in defining initial conditions for network topology design is immense. This PhD thesis aims to introduce a novel method for approximating the maximum availability of intricate telecommunications networks. A network synthesis method was developed to achieve maximum availability values. The initial network topology for this new method is a chain. The synthesis begins by forming a ring and subsequently adding links one-by-one to the network topology, ensuring maximum all-terminal availability increase. By adding a single link at a time, all with equal availability, the network is synthesized, with each step achieving maximum availability given the number of nodes, links, and link availability. The approximation functions for maximum network availability, given the number of nodes, links, and link availability, are derived from the analysis of the network synthesis method results for networks with maximum availability. The network's availability limits (dependent on the network topology) can be calculated using the approximation functions. Furthermore, these functions can define the boundaries for the number of links needed to achieve the desired availability with the appropriate network topology choice. It has been demonstrated that for maximum network availability, all nodes should have equal connectivity, differing by one at most. With this rule and a predetermined limit on the network's number of links, the network design process can be completed in several iterations to achieve the requested availability. The running time of the approximation functions defined in this dissertation is independent of the network size, allowing for numerous calculations and analysis of various input parameter combinations. The approximation functions defined in this thesis have proven to be more accurate than those previously published. The approximate values calculated were compared with the exact availability values, showing that the relative approximation error is significantly less than 1% for networks with link availability exceeding 0.75.
