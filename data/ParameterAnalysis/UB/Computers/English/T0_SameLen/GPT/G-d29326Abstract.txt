The evolution of contemporary network environments, their utilization, and their interoperability dynamics with other technologically diverse concepts, hinges on the use and compatibility of various heterogeneous technologies. This intricate network environment is perpetually subject to numerous operational challenges, with the assurance of service and data security and safety being paramount. The continual growth in user numbers and the rapid development of new applications demanding high bandwidth has set new security system standards, which rely on monitoring and effectively comprehending network traffic characteristics. Given the escalating development in cyberattacks, ongoing dynamic changes in network traffic, and the growing heterogeneity of technologies and devices used, the creation of anomaly and attack detection solutions has become imperative. While numerous studies in existing literature deal with network traffic flow analysis for performance and security monitoring, only a handful focus on generating network traffic behavior profiles or specific communication patterns. In this context, network behavior analysis depends on understanding normal or acceptable behavior patterns, enabling effective detection of unusual, anomalous behavior patterns. Unlike intrusion detection systems based on packet payload or signature (signature-based), this approach is extremely beneficial not only for identifying unknown threats, zero-day attacks, and suspicious behavior, but also for enhancing overall network performance. This dissertation suggests a new method for detecting attacks and anomalies, which relies on profiling network traffic using only IP addresses and port numbers collected via the NetFlow protocol. The suggested solution depends on a specific preprocessing of network traffic flows by applying entropy calculation over certain traffic flow instance attributes. Then, through aggregation techniques, additional attributes are calculated, reflecting participant communication activity in the observed time interval - epoch. By further transforming the generated attributes, several characteristic signatures are formed, describing the network traffic profiles. Then, using the enhanced hierarchical clustering algorithm, traffic instances are grouped according to the defined profiles. The dissertation provides a thorough review of the issues in detecting and identifying anomalies and attacks in modern network environments and applies a systematic approach to resolving these issues, starting from the defined hypotheses, analyzing network traffic flow characteristics, and then suggesting a new solution based on a combination of different techniques. It involves network traffic flow pre-processing, attribute value entropy calculation, their aggregation, generation of specific network traffic profile signatures, and the application of a modified hierarchical agglomerative clustering (HAC) algorithm. The fundamental idea is to enable quick and efficient processing of real network environment data, in cases of working with unlabeled, incomplete, and different flow lengths. The suggested solution assumes that each data flow includes certain information and volumetric attributes, while the application of special aggregation techniques generates additional attributes, the so-called behavioral attributes. Similar to entropy-based techniques, in this case, aggregation is applied over each data flow, while these preprocessed attributes are then interpreted as a separate communication flow signature. One of the dissertation's objectives is to find a method that would enhance entropy-based techniques with the application of various machine learning algorithms, and it relies on the proposal of two new approaches.
