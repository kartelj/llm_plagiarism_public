Economies reliant on knowledge are heavily dependent on its adoption and application to enhance their competitiveness. In such settings, vast quantities of pertinent knowledge exist both within and outside organizations. The ever-changing global market compels organizations to utilize their knowledge flows to meet their needs and gain a competitive edge. Organizations aim for ongoing knowledge accumulation to enhance their business solutions and products, identify new market opportunities, fortify their knowledge base, and forecast market trends. These factors amplify the significance of the concept of absorptive capacity, which pertains to an organization's acquisition, assimilation, transformation, and application of knowledge. While numerous studies have dissected absorptive capacity into components and examined their traits, this research scrutinizes the relationships between absorptive capacity dimensions and elements, and the extent of their impact on the absorptive capacity level of organizations in technology and knowledge-intensive industries. To this end, an absorptive capacity management model that tracks knowledge flow from acquisition to application has been developed and implemented. This model hinges on the segmentation of absorptive capacity into dimensions and components. The outcomes of the absorptive capacity evaluation model's application were scrutinized to investigate the potential to gauge the impact of absorptive capacity on an organization's competitive prowess, which is this doctoral dissertation's primary hypothesis. For the research, both quantitative and qualitative methodologies based on a survey were employed. The gathered data were analyzed using the absorptive capacity evaluation model, with discriminant analysis serving as the statistical method. The research findings indicate that it is feasible to assess the absorptive capacity level using the model's indicators, and that the most influential determinant of absorptive capacity is the available relevant knowledge. The effect of absorptive capacity on organizations' competitiveness was ascertained using the principles of the Balanced Scorecard model. The research results suggest that it is possible to manage the determinants of absorptive capacity within the provided framework. The research outcomes will enhance the understanding of the absorptive capacity framework in sectors heavily dependent on knowledge adoption and use for further growth, which is crucial for the competitiveness of knowledge-based economies, including the Republic of Serbia, given its strategic direction. The developed model can offer management assistance in the realms of organizational learning and knowledge and innovation management.
