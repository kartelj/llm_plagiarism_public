This dissertation survey the application of modern software engineering methods for open source software development in the field of intelligent systems. Main results are a general model of software framework and recommendations for managing open source projects in that field. Framework model and recommendations for the project management were developed and validated in practice through the development of additional features of a selected software framework for neural networks. Selected neural network framework is one of the leading Java open source neural network frameworks. Suggested software development methods are also applicable in other fields of intelligent systems, and they are response to problems and specific requirements in this field. Most problems are due the fact that it is often software for research purposes, that should also be applicable for practical problems, and complexity of the software that also needs to be easy to use and modify. Proposed development methods are related to requirements specification, planning, design, implementation and maintenance. They are given in the form of recommendations that have been proven as a good practice. In addition to these theoretical and methodological contributions, this dissertation also provides practical contribution in the form of new features for one selected framework in the field of intelligent systems, which greatly enhance its practical application.
