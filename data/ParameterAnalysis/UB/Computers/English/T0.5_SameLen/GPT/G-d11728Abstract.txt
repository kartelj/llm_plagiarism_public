The initial section of this thesis provides an examination of the routing protocols within data center topologies. Focus is placed on two-phase routing protocols, which facilitate congestion prevention in data center topologies that are standard and offer a considerable number of alternative routes. This thesis introduces a novel two-phase routing algorithm, LB-ECR, that promotes improved exploitation of data center networks. By employing linear programming, LB-ECR optimizes the non-loss throughput for the specified necessary traffic of the switches. LB-ECR is rooted in ECMP routing, prevalent in data centers due to its usage of alternative equal-cost routes. Two-phase balancing allows for the linear model's simplification by removing traffic flows and reducing the chance of congestion by spreading traffic across underutilized links. This simplification of the linear model eases its resolution for large data centers. The initial section of this thesis presents a summary of the network topologies and the routing in data centers, as well as a performance comparison of various routing algorithms in standard data center topologies.
Apart from routing optimization, this thesis investigates the algorithms for refreshing the lookup tables of Internet routers. The second section of this thesis offers a summary of the lookup and update algorithms. The updating performance of two sophisticated lookup algorithms is scrutinized. We formulate equations for the worst-case memory requirements for two speedy lookup algorithms, while through simulations we demonstrate the memory requirements for standard routing tables. We also assess the number of memory accesses to the lookup modules during updates, the complexity of the updating algorithms, and their execution time for standard routing tables.
The final part of this thesis comprises a depiction of the implementations of the two-phase routing algorithms and of the lookup update algorithms, as well as the incorporation of these elements within the router.
