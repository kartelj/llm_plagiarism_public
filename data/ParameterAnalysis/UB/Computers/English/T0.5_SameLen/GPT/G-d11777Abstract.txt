A data warehouse serves as the foundation for implementing business intelligence systems, data amalgamation, and decision support. A dimensional model is typically constructed for the data warehouse to enhance data visualization. The architecture of a data warehouse outlines the basic elements of a data warehouse and elucidates their interconnections and structure. Two prevailing approaches exist in the realm of data warehouse architecture. The first, known as the Corporate Information Factory (CIF) architecture, is advocated by Bill Inmon, who asserts that a data warehouse should be normalized and contain atomic data in the third normal form. The second approach, the BUS architecture, is championed by Ralph Kimball, who maintains that a warehouse should also possess a multi-dimensional structure. Daniel Linstedt designed the Data Vault concept of a data warehouse, which constitutes a detailed, historically tracked, and uniquely linked group of normalized tables that support one or more business functional areas. This hybrid approach incorporates the best features from the third normal form (3NF) and the star scheme. The Data Vault concept underscores the necessity of tracing the origin and timing of data entries into the database, and facilitates easy modifications to the data warehouse structure in response to changes in the business environment. Different methodological approaches are used to construct data warehouses, but the process of designing a data warehouse and the related dimensional model is not automated. This dissertation examines the problem of the data warehouse design process, based on an extensive literature review, and explores the potential for automating the physical design of a data warehouse based on the Data Vault concept, with minimal user interaction. The study introduces a simple algorithm for automating the physical design of a data warehouse based on the Data Vault concept, using a data model with metadata transactional data sources and rules. The algorithm for direct access to the physical design of a data warehouse formalizes, generalizes, and largely automates the process of physical design for data warehouses based on a physical model of structured, semi-structured, and simple non-structured data sources. The relational model is a shared factor for both Data Vault implementation and original data, which is why all types are abstracted with a meta-model. The direct approach implies that the Physical Data Vault (PDV) is realized directly based on the physical data source model in relational form. The conceptualization of metadata is depicted with a physical data model that, with minor modifications, can be employed in the design of individual data warehouses and constitutes the primary methodological contribution of the study. Additionally, this study provides a comprehensive integrated approach to automating data warehouse design because the approach facilitates the design of data marts and related ETL processes (from a source to a data warehouse and from a data warehouse to data marts). This approach achieves the integration of all activities required for the realization of an entire data warehouse. Based on the findings of the dissertation research, a prototype application has been developed to support the physical design of a data warehouse. Experiments with the algorithm, using a prototype of the design automation application, in a real-world healthcare insurance scenario, yielded satisfactory results.
