E-learning is a multifaceted system encompassing remote learning, lectures, and various electronic classroom materials; both individual and group learning methods, teacher and interactive work. A substantial and swift growth in user, service, and educational content and resources necessitates, confronts educational institutions and their e-learning systems with new optimization challenges, with the need for dynamic competitiveness, and with managing the costs of these systems. This results in increasingly complex demands for the development and implementation of IT infrastructure for e-learning systems. By utilizing modern information and communication technologies, the efficiency, flexibility, and cost-effectiveness of e-learning systems can be enhanced. By implementing IT infrastructure models for e-learning based on the modern IT concept of Cloud Computing, the reliability, scalability, and cost-effectiveness of an educational process system can be improved. The lack of scientific support in the application of the Cloud Computing concept in modeling the IT infrastructure of higher education in the Republic of Serbia and the strategic importance of this concept underscores the need to establish theoretical support for its more efficient development and application. In this regard, the dissertation research subject is presented, based on defining and developing plans and activities of higher education institutions, related to the development of an IT infrastructure model for e-learning using the Cloud Computing concept. By examining existing and exploring new ways of providing services to students and research staff, higher education institutions face numerous challenges, primarily related to digital identity and access management. The first and perhaps most significant challenge is to encourage the adoption and implementation of digital identity management systems. Successful IT infrastructure for digital identity management necessitates systematic consideration of identities and the interdependence that exists between them. The second challenge is to provide support for a system capable of leveraging all the benefits of federation systems for digital identity management. The development of such federations among educational institutions facilitates user, content, and service mobility. The main hypothesis formulated and validated within the doctoral thesis is that the application of a developed IT infrastructure model can impact the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of e-learning systems. The experimental portion of the doctoral thesis comprises a study aimed at validating the proposed IT infrastructure model for e-learning. The study was conducted in the E-Business Laboratory at the Faculty of Organizational Sciences. The research results demonstrated that the implemented IT infrastructure model enabled a more efficient, flexible, and economical e-learning system.
