This doctoral thesis primarily focuses on the creation of a novel methodological framework and the empirical application of an internal credit rating model for medium and large Serbian companies. The principal objective is to quantify the credit risk of these companies using a newly developed credit scoring model, and to evaluate their credit quality using the developed internal credit rating model. The research is based on data from seven years of financial statements, including balance sheets and income statements, from Serbian companies between 2006 and 2012. This data allows for the calculation of default probabilities for these companies, taking into account the unique characteristics of this market and business environment. The thesis, rooted in the author's original methodology, encompasses three broad areas. The first involves analyzing a large number of financial ratios and identifying the most predictive financial ratio in Serbia based on historical data. The transformation of this financial ratio data has been used to develop the credit scoring model. As a key outcome, a new credit scoring model that quantifies default probability has been created and suggested. This model has superior predictive capabilities compared to models like the Altman Z-score model, which were developed and used in foreign markets. Ultimately, an internal credit rating model was proposed and created using an original approach that utilizes results from the previously developed credit scoring model. The final models and their results were subject to a validation process, as suggested by relevant academic literature and the new Basel Capital Accord standards. Credit risk weights based on Basel II and III principles were calculated, and it was shown that all results presented in this research support the initial hypothesis of this doctoral thesis.
