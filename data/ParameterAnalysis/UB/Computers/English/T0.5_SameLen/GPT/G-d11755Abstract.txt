Despite significant advances in artificial intelligence, the human brain remains superior in understanding and manipulating partially known information. This is particularly evident in the area of question answering, where human expertise excels in providing explanations, constructing complex responses, and abstract reasoning. Intelligent Question Routing Systems (IQRS) act as a conduit for knowledge exchange in any field requiring intensive user communication. The advantages of implementing such systems include reducing unnecessary expert engagement and enhancing service quality for system owners like businesses, governments, and universities, as users receive satisfactory answers from the right individuals. This dissertation presents a methodology for designing IQRS systems, beginning with a review of existing research in this field, with a focus on IQRS process implementation. The review also presents a unique paradigm summarizing the essence of approaches found in existing literature, encompassing three primary processing stages: question analysis, question forwarding, and user knowledge profiling. The analysis results in a proposed approach to address identified issues. The dissertation proceeds to describe an IQRS prototype implementing these ideas. The question analysis module employs an approach enabling question visualization and combines automatic text processing with manual result correction, improving output accuracy. Concurrently, the text processing module is utilized for answer analysis. A discussion on existing methods for determining semantic similarity between two short texts is included, with a focus on languages with limited electronic linguistic resources, like Serbian. Based on these conclusions, a new algorithm, LInSTSS, is proposed, which calculates semantic similarity considering the specificity of words in the texts. Additionally, a Serbian paraphrase corpus is created, and the results show the proposed algorithm outperforms existing solutions. Evaluation on paraphrase corpora for both English and Serbian is used to adjust algorithm parameters. Lessons learned are applied to designing a module for calculating semantic similarity between a question and a user profile. In the question forwarding phase, issues related to comparing questions and user profiles are discussed, and a new algorithm, P2Q, is proposed. This algorithm identifies the highest similarity between concepts in a question and those in a user profile. An analysis of available web portals is conducted to identify one suitable for creating a question and answer corpus. The corpus identifies three user types, modeling interests, knowledge, and both. The corpus tests the initial hypothesis and evaluates overall system performance. Results show the P2Q approach significantly outperforms other evaluated methods and that semantic information extraction from text can improve results. The dissertation's scientific contribution lies in analyzing and synthesizing a software system for intelligent question routing. Evaluation results indicate properly assigned weights can improve system performance, but incorrect assignment can significantly decrease it. It concludes that profiling user competence to answer a question requires considering not only the best-answered questions, i.e., profiling knowledge, but also questions expressing interests.
