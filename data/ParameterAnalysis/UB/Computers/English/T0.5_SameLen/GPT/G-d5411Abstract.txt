The thesis herein discusses the exploration of fuzzy functional dependencies within fuzzy relational database models. The aim is to scrutinize and analyze recent findings in this field, and to devise our unique algorithm for discerning dependencies among attributes in fuzzy relations, based on fuzzy implication in fuzzy logic. The issue of analyzing fuzzy functional dependency in fuzzy relational database models is not a novel one. Numerous papers and authors have tackled this topic over the past two decades. However, a review of the literature reveals no existing algorithm capable of identifying relationships between attributes in relational schemas. This limitation spurred the creation of our methodology in the examination of fuzzy functional dependencies across a given attribute set. Addressing this not so new issue is not just a theoretical research challenge, but also carries practical implications. The integration of logical database models offered by prior theory into other fields and areas (GIS, Data Mining, Information Retrieval, data redundancy reduction, null value estimation, etc.) is a key objective of this paper. The initial hypothesis posited that fuzzy set theory and a specific segment of fuzzy logic are ideal solutions when database managers struggle to definitively ascertain the relationships between data and attributes within a relation. In the realm of artificial intelligence, fuzzy sets and fuzzy logic are examined in the context of fuzzy relational database design within intelligent systems, as they are potent tools for managing and representing uncertain and imprecise information. Discovering potential dependencies among attributes in fuzzy relations is essentially a data mining technique connected to concealed and useful knowledge utilized for decision-making. This thesis introduces a novel technique for identifying existing dependencies between tuple pairs using various fuzzy implications, as characterized by the author. Fuzzy implications that meet set acceptance criteria are utilized to estimate linguistic strength θ when fuzzy functional dependency X  Y is fulfilled. To demonstrate the proposed methodology and verify the research, we conducted an experiment on real data under two distinct models: a fuzzy database model based on proximity relation and a fuzzy database model with a possibility distribution. Identifying potential dependencies among attributes of the observed fuzzy relation essentially uncovers concealed and useful knowledge, i.e., a data mining technique. To identify a fuzzy functional dependency within the corresponding fuzzy model, the following steps are required: 1. Data preparation for analysis (preprocessing, data summarization, data warehousing, etc.). 2. Finding subrelations (n-tuples) on the observed attributes with potentially concealed fuzzy functional dependencies. 3. Associating fuzzy functional dependencies with corresponding fuzzy implications. 4. Interpreting search results to obtain the final set of fuzzy dependencies. From a practical standpoint, when searching for fuzzy functional dependencies within fuzzy database models using the proposed methodology, it is also necessary to conduct an efficiency analysis. A potential drawback is the total number of transactions (possible tuple pairs with associated values) that need to be computed, which can be costly for large databases. An increase in the number of tuples, as well as the number of attributes of the relational scheme, exponentially increases the number of tuples. However, this PhD thesis proposes and demonstrates that it is possible to increase the algorithm's efficiency and decrease the number of computed transactions. Nevertheless, it should be noted that the nature of the problem at hand dictates the algorithm's efficiency. Some databases do not require compression, while in other cases, when dealing with large databases, various techniques for relation reduction are proposed, such as data summarization based on fuzzification, cluster formation, granulation, representing a number of similar tuples with one representative tuple, etc. In general, our research demonstrates how to extract intelligent information from fuzzy relational databases. To identify potential relationships among attributes of a fuzzy relation, we must first prepare the data for analysis, i.e., create a table with tuple pairs and conformance values on all attributes of the original relation. The next step is to find sub-relations where the criteria for the existence of fuzzy dependencies have been met. The third step is to associate fuzzy functional dependencies with corresponding fuzzy implications. Finally, we interpret the results of the previous steps to obtain the final set of fuzzy functional dependencies. The most significant contribution of this thesis is the characterization of fuzzy set theory and fuzzy implications in the context of developing tools and algorithms that facilitate the identification of relationships among attributes in the observed relational schemes. It is worth noting that this paper is an empirical study and a "proof-of-concept", without developed commercial software. Furthermore, we discuss certain practical cases where this methodology may be applicable. Our experiments suggest that the results provided by the algorithm are acceptable. As future work, we plan to apply this research in various scenarios and applications involving this methodology, such as estimating null values in relational databases, text mining, extracting dependencies from practical knowledge databases, etc.
