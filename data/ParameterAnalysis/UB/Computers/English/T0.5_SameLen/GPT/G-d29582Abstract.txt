The surge in data and devices has spurred the swift evolution of technology and machine learning algorithms utilized in data analysis and processing systems. The performance of these systems, inundated with vast amounts of data for analysis and processing, relies entirely on the quality of the data, the chosen algorithm, and the parameters of that algorithm. Data anomalies, which deviate from data distribution and impact data quality, can be identified through machine learning algorithms. The chosen algorithm and parameters for anomaly detection are entirely reliant on the system creator or domain expert's expertise. In instances where there are no labeled anomaly samples, a common occurrence in the real world, selecting the right algorithm for anomaly detection is a non-trivial issue. The task of choosing an algorithm for anomaly detection can be automated through an automated machine learning system (AutoML) that suggests an algorithm for anomaly detection based on data and meta-features. An increasing number of research papers are highlighting AutoML frameworks, which are emerging as a promising solution for constructing intricate machine learning models without the need for human expertise or intervention. The primary challenge in equipping AutoML frameworks to construct an efficient model for anomaly detection tasks is identifying the optimal underlying model for a specific task and optimization metric. Meta-learning approaches, based on a set of meta-features that describe data properties, can facilitate efficient model selection in AutoML frameworks. Current meta-learning approaches that rely on statistical and information-theoretic meta-features necessitate large quantities of data and computational resources to extract data properties. This doctoral dissertation's research focus is the creation of a scalable system for extracting meta-features based on domain-specific knowledge. The aim is to compare the proposed meta-features with existing solutions through various complexity aspects to evaluate them. Additionally, the goal is to design experiments and obtain results that can be utilized in future automated machine learning research. Experimental results evaluation shows that the proposed meta-features achieve 87% accuracy and satisfy the critical requirements for use in AutoML systems, while existing solutions achieve 73% accuracy. In instances where there is an insufficient number of datasets available for evaluation, the proposed solution's performance is 25% worse compared to existing solutions. The research's importance lies in the potential for implementing AutoML systems based on the proposed meta-features. In instances where there are no labeled anomaly samples, or data is absent, the data creator or domain expert can effectively characterize the data anomalies based on domain-specific knowledge.
