Retrieving pixels from memory is a well-known performance hindrance for SIMD (Single-Instruction Multiple-Data) processors in image and video processing. This dissertation introduces a novel parallel on-chip memory subsystem solution, inclusive of new features and a supportive architecture, which allows for greater processing throughput and less energy consumption per processed pixel compared to existing state-of-the-art subsystems.

The dissertation initially introduces new features of a parallel memory subsystem, namely new block and row access modes, which are more suitable for image and video processing algorithms than the features of current parallel memory subsystems. These new access modes drastically decrease the number of on-chip memory read and write accesses, thus accelerating the imaging/video kernels that this work focuses on: sub-pixel block-matching motion estimation, pixel interpolation for motion compensation, and spatial window-based filtering. The primary concept of the new access modes is to utilize spatial overlaps of blocks/rows accessed in the memory subsystem, known at the subsystem design-time, and combine multiple accesses into a single one by accessing slightly more pixels at once than with other parallel memories. To circumvent the requirement for a broader, and hence more expensive SIMD datapath, this work suggests new memory read operations that divide all pixels accessed at once into multiple SIMD-wide blocks/rows, in a manner suitable for further processing. Besides a higher processing throughput, the new access modes decrease the energy used by the parallel memory subsystem for the same quantity of processed pixels, by reducing the number of repeated accesses of the same pixels.

Secondly, to substantiate the concept and for the completeness of the proposed solution, the dissertation outlines a parametric, scalable, and cost-efficient architecture that supports the new access modes, as well as access modes of existing parallel memory subsystems. The architecture is founded on: 1) a previously proposed collection of memory banks with multiple pixels per addressable word of a bank, 2) a previously suggested shifted scheme for arranging pixels in the banks that allows parallel access to all pixels of a block/row, and 3) control logic that implements the shifted scheme in the memory banks and the access modes, thereby offering a convenient and efficient programming interface.

The benefits of the proposed parallel memory subsystem solution are analytically and experimentally shown on a case study of the well-known 3DRS sub-pixel block-matching motion estimation algorithm, frequently used for real-time frame-rate conversion during video playback. The implemented block-matcher, based on the proposed parallel memory subsystem, can process 3840*2160 video at a rate of 60 frames per second, while clocked at 600 MHz. In comparison to block-matcher implementations based on the six state-of-the-art subsystems and the same SIMD datapath, this work achieves 40 – 70% higher throughput, uses 17 – 44% less energy, and has similar silicon area and off-chip memory bandwidth costs. This is 1.8 – 2.9 times more efficient than the previous state-of-the-art, calculated as the ratio between the achieved processing throughput and the total of all costs: energy consumption, silicon area, and off-chip memory bandwidth. Such high efficiency is the outcome of the new access modes and the cost-effective architecture, which reduced the number of on-chip memory accesses by 1.6 – 2.1 times.

Due to its demonstrated efficiency, the proposed parallel memory subsystem is employed in the most recent and most advanced Intel processors and systems-on-chip for image and video processing on mobile devices. Moreover, it is consistently being enhanced for use in future generations of Intel processors.
