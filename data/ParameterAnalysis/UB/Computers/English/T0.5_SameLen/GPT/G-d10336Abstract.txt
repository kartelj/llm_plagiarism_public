This paper introduces a new approach for monitoring student engagement using the Internet of Things and machine learning algorithms. The key hypothesis proven in this PhD thesis is that the application of the Internet of Things in education can enhance teaching efficacy by incorporating a system for monitoring student engagement, which allows for environmental parameters analysis and presentation of processed results. To provide further understanding necessary for the implementation of the aforementioned processes and to validate the need for conducting the study, a review of pertinent computer and social science research is conducted. This review involves a comparative analysis of smart classroom platforms, which serve as a conduit for these new algorithms to emerge and identify sociological contexts at the moment of occurrence. Sociological sciences are crucial as they aid in understanding the context of the sociological processes being observed and classified; hence a review of sociological sciences and social signals are primarily included to conclude the review of relevant research and direct the further implementation of the proposed system. Furthermore, the review also highlights potential parameters and algorithms that can be employed, coupled with a methodology description for all stages of the research. Subsequently, the requirements of such a system are analyzed and crucial features necessary for detection are identified, along with sociological factors that impact these features. Pattern classification is achieved by employing a machine learning technique that necessitates a classifier based on a specific dataset. Prior to implementation, system simulation is conducted on a dataset not used in the training process. During simulation, the system demonstrated an average accuracy of 92.2%. Following the simulation, the system was put into operation and its performance assessed by comparing real-time student feedback with the system output during lectures. The average accuracy of the system, evaluated across three different student groups, was 81.9%.
