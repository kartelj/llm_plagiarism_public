'Digital image compression and coding focus on reducing the memory resources required for presentation, storage, and transmission of digital images. Utilizing compression methods results in significant savings. Quick algorithms and structures for compression and decompression are crucial in applications that need real-time performance. Current techniques for digital image compression with a high compression ratio are slow and necessitate complex processors and large quantities of high bandwidth memory, simultaneously raising power usage. Both processing time and memory capacity grow as the compression ratio rises. In this doctoral thesis, we tackled the issue of hardware implementation of a codec that reduces the necessary memory resources, is quick and has a high compression ratio. This goal was achieved using a combination of scientific methods. The reduction of necessary memory resources is attained through optimized nonstationary filters and a new two-dimensional subband transformation algorithm, as well as a one pass realization of probability estimators. The operation speed is achieved through a one pass algorithm for probability estimation and the fact that the input image is not partially processed. The high compression ratio is achieved through the combined effects of all subsystems in the implementation: subband transformer, quantizer, one pass probabilities estimator, and entropy encoder. The hardware implementation from this thesis has been verified through an image compression system with a network interface. It is demonstrated that it is feasible to implement an entire color image encoder within a low cost programmable logic device, without any external memory components.
