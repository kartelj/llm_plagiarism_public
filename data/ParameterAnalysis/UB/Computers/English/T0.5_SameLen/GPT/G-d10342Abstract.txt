Economies that rely on knowledge are heavily dependent on the use and implementation of knowledge to enhance their competitiveness. In this context, vast quantities of pertinent knowledge are situated both within and external to organizations. The ever-changing global market compels organizations to utilize their knowledge streams to meet their requirements, in a bid to gain a competitive edge. Organizations are constantly seeking to accumulate knowledge to enhance their business strategies and products, explore new market possibilities, fortify their knowledge foundation, and forecast market trends. This heightens the significance of the concept of absorptive capacity, which pertains to the acquisition, assimilation, transformation, and implementation of knowledge by an organization. Despite numerous studies focusing on breaking down absorptive capacity into elements and examining their traits, this research investigates the relationships between absorptive capacity dimensions and components, as well as the magnitude of their impact on the absorptive capacity level of organizations in technology and knowledge-intensive industries. To this end, a model to manage absorptive capacity that tracks knowledge flow from acquisition to implementation has been developed and utilized. This model is premised on dividing absorptive capacity into dimensions and components. The outcomes of employing the absorptive capacity evaluation model were scrutinized to assess the potential of evaluating the impact of absorptive capacity on an organization's competitive prowess, which is the primary hypothesis of this doctoral thesis. Quantitative and qualitative methodologies based on a survey were employed for the research. The collected data were evaluated using the absorptive capacity evaluation model, with discriminant analysis as the statistical method. The research findings indicate that it is feasible to assess the level of absorptive capacity using the model's indicators, and that the most influential determinant of absorptive capacity is the available relevant knowledge. The impact of absorptive capacity on organizational competitiveness was ascertained using the principles of the Balanced Scorecard model. The research results suggest that it is feasible to manage the determinants of absorptive capacity within the provided framework. The findings of this study will enhance comprehension of the absorptive capacity framework in sectors heavily dependent on the adoption and utilization of knowledge for further growth, which is crucial for the competitiveness of knowledge-based economies, including Serbia, given its strategic orientation. The developed model can offer management assistance in organizational learning, knowledge, and innovation management areas.
