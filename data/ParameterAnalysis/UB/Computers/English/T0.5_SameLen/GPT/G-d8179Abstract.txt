This thesis explores the creation and utilization of an interoperable e-Business model for payment systems, grounded in ontologies and the Resource-Event-Agent - REA (ISO/IEC 15944-4:2007) ontological object system structure. The study is based on referential models in information exchange according to global business standards in the financial industry. The research will utilize insights and knowledge from the implementation of the Check Clearing and Direct Debit systems within the Association of Serbian Banks, developed using Enterprise Integration Patterns (EIP) and standardized message systems. The research will be tailored to the implementation of interoperable payment systems in Serbia. Various payment systems interacting with different participants' business systems during electronic transactions are considered. These business systems support numerous users and business processes with unique requirements. The main issue is the disparity between business processes, data, and IT technologies, leading to wasted time, financial, and informatics resources in data transfer between systems. With the increasing prevalence of electronic financial transactions, there is a need for the development of interoperable e-Business models for payment systems for financial transaction exchange and processing. The standardization of payment system modeling, as discussed in this study, should enhance the efficiency of other electronic business systems and the interoperability of participants' electronic businesses. In every country, the payment system includes various payment instruments, banking procedures, and fund transfer systems between financial institutions, enabling money circulation. The Central Bank directly manages, regulates, and directs the flow of money, functioning as the regulator of financial flows through the control of payment systems. The most significant is the Real Time Gross Settlement System - RTGS, primarily under Central Bank supervision. Banks' systems and other financial institutions' systems connect through the RTGS System. These include institutions like clearing houses, payment agents, processing houses, among others, which are legally defined and deal with implementation, processing, information acquisition, or distribution regarding financial transactions and other electronic business systems. Payment systems, as described in this work, consolidate elements present in every message-based system, technological elements of supervising institutions, dictated by the standard message format, environmental conditions imposed by the location with the implemented payment system (in financial vertical, with the type of processing it is committed to, geopolitical typology, and other possible elements), necessary communicational interaction, and information technologies required for the execution of general and specific tasks. Ontologies, being formal descriptions of objects, their characteristics, and relationships in a specific domain, are explicitly understandable for humans and computers. In this study, the ontological approach provides interoperability and consistency in the model and enhances the model's design from the knowledge domain. The standard ISO 15944-4:2007, examined in this study, establishes the ontological foundation for specifying the concepts and relations included in business transactions and scenarios known as Resource-Event-Agent â€“ REA ontology.
