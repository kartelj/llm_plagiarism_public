Statistical methods in natural language processing often need substantial quantities of labelled data, and frequently different auxiliary language tools, restricting their use in resource-deprived environments. This dissertation introduces a technique for crafting statistical strategies in the semantic analysis of natural languages with limited resources. In such languages, not only is there a scarcity of existing language resources, the ability to create new datasets and dedicated tools and algorithms is also limited. The suggested technique concentrates on short texts because of their dominance in digital communication, and the increased complexity in their semantic analysis. The technique covers all stages in the development of statistical strategies, from gathering textual content, to data annotation, to the design, training, and assessment of machine learning models. Its application is demonstrated in depth on two semantic tasks - sentiment analysis and semantic textual similarity. The Serbian language is used as a representative of a language with limited resources, but the suggested technique can also be applied to other languages in this category. Besides the general technique, the contributions of this dissertation include the creation of a new, versatile short-text sentiment annotation system, a new annotation cost-effectiveness metric, and several new semantic textual similarity models. The dissertation results also involve the generation of the first publicly accessible annotated datasets of short texts in Serbian for the tasks of sentiment analysis and semantic textual similarity, the creation and assessment of numerous models on these tasks, and the first comparative assessment of multiple morphological normalization tools on short texts in Serbian.
