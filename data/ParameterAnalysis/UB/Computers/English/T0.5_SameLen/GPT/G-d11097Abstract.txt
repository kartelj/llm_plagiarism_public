Market positioning is a concept that involves active participation in creating tourist offerings or services, allowing tourism companies to secure an optimal market stance. The initial positioning approach, born in the 1970s, focused on a single company's promotional activities, with the main challenge being to secure a unique place in consumer's minds through marketing efforts. Despite various authors interpreting and defining the positioning concept differently over time, no universal market coordinates have been established that guarantee an optimal, stable, and sustainable market position. As the positioning concept evolved, the methods to achieve positioning goals also changed, spanning from multidimensional scaling to discriminant, factor, and Conjoint analysis. This dissertation suggests a new solution to market positioning issues, combining statistical models and operational research models. This allows marketing managers to react promptly and formulate market positioning strategies in a competitive environment. The proposed model allows for anticipating potential competitive moves, striking a balance between focusing on consumer preferences and competition, leading to a better formulation of the optimal market strategy. Conjoint analysis is used to assess consumer preferences as it offers insight into market heterogeneity and the potential to determine the optimal features of a tourist product. If preferences are heterogeneous, cluster analysis can be used for market segmentation. Considering modern markets are inevitably competitive, all possible market interactions need to be considered. This seemingly chaotic market conflict conceals rationalities that can be modeled using game theory concepts. The combined use of these three models (Conjoint analysis, cluster analysis, and game theory) allows for better determination of the optimal market position than previous models that used these separately. The application and validity of this unique market positioning model are demonstrated through testing in real-life gastronomy events. The model's adaptability, flexibility, and ability for dynamic decision-making make it significant, as it can be reused to achieve the optimal market position in response to market changes like new product launches, product improvements or changes in consumer preferences. In the future, this model has potential for widespread use in all tourism sectors and the service sector, where it could serve as a general paradigm for determining the optimal market position.
