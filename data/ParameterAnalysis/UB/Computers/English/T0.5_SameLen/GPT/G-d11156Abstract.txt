This thesis aims to illustrate and clarify how decision-making in choosing the most economically viable bidder in public e-procurement can be enhanced. The selection hinges on preset standards set by the buyer in public e-procurement. The selection process is straightforward when there are a few bidders and when quantifiable criteria that can be compared are established. However, practical situations often involve a large number of bidders, and the choice of the most suitable among them is based on both qualitative and quantitative standards. The central hypothesis of this thesis, validated within the context of the doctoral dissertation, is that the application of multi-criteria decision-making methods and fuzzy set theory can enhance the selection of the most economically viable bidder in public e-procurement when both quantitative and qualitative criteria are used simultaneously. In such selection scenarios, it is feasible to identify the values linked to the output variable that matches the weights of the criteria belonging to a fuzzy set through defuzzification, or the selection of a single output variable value with the same quantification. Concurrently, the dissertation introduces a decision support system grounded in multi-criteria decision-making and fuzzy set theory. This system is a crucial component of the public e-procurement web portal, facilitating the creation of a collaborative workspace that seamlessly integrates buyers and suppliers into a unified virtual e-procurement platform.
