Parallel knowledge tests are examinations composed of different item sets (various types of questions or tasks) with roughly equal measurement properties, making them interchangeable. They are suitable when multiple test-takers are involved, irrespective of whether they take the test simultaneously or at different times. The test results must be comparable. Automating the parallel test assembly process is practically essential for ensuring objectivity by adequately balancing the measurement properties of various test forms and minimizing the likelihood of examiner's subjective errors. Furthermore, the larger the scale of testing, the more significant the time savings for the examiner in preparing parallel tests through automation. Since automated parallel test assembly (APTA) is a NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem, heuristic use is expected and necessary. The APTA problem is isomorphic with certain existing combinatorial optimization problems, so heuristics used to solve those problems can also be applied to the APTA problem. The dissertation presents a comprehensive review of existing problem formulations, mathematical models, and an overview of heuristics used to solve different problem formulations. Initially, problem formulations and heuristic solutions are categorized independently, then their cross-classification reveals opportunities for exploration through new combinations of problem formulations and solution heuristics. Heuristics used to solve APTA problems primarily include improvement heuristics, which are interrupted either when a set execution time is reached or when the desired solution quality is achieved. Constructive heuristics are primarily used to generate an initial solution for improvement heuristics. This dissertation proposes a new efficient polynomial complexity method for completely solving the APTA problem. The proposed method solves a bin packing problem formulation by adapting a constructive heuristic proposed by Nawaz, Enschore, and Ham, which has not been used for the APTA problem before. The new method features predictable execution time, efficiency, and ease of implementation. Predictable time and efficient test assembly are particularly important in educational institutions where frequent testing of a relatively small number of test-takers occurs, and where available computer resources for APTA are limited. The proposed APTA method has been implemented and compared with efficient comparable methods based on improvement heuristics, such as simulated annealing (SA) and variable neighbourhood search (VNS). In the existing literature, the VNS method provides the highest quality results for the APTA problem formulated as a bin packing problem. The proposed algorithm's execution time is significantly shorter than the SA algorithm, with only marginally worse quality. Compared to the VNS algorithm, the average execution time is significantly shorter, and for the same execution time (achieved by interrupting the VNS algorithm), the proposed algorithm yields better quality results for cases with a relatively small number of parallel tests (20, 30, and 60) and relatively small item banks (300 items), which are common in educational institution knowledge tests.
