Modern society's progression heavily relies on superior telecommunication networks. Hence, it's crucial for these networks to maintain high availability, ensuring end users have uninterrupted access to services. Presently, backbone networks are typically composed of numerous nodes (dozens), making it challenging to directly compute their availability due to the exponential increase in algorithm execution time with rising nodes and links. Therefore, using approximation algorithms during network design is practically significant to assist in defining the initial conditions for network topology design. This PhD thesis aims to introduce a novel approach for approximating the maximum availability of complex telecommunication networks. To attain maximum availability values, a network synthesis method was developed. The starting network topology for this innovative method is a chain. When determining maximum network availability, the synthesis begins by forming a ring, then progressively adds links to the network topology, ensuring maximum all-terminal availability increase. By adding one link at a time, all links having equal availability, the network is synthesized, each step achieving maximum availability for a given number of nodes, links, and link availability. The approximation functions for maximum network availability, given a specific number of nodes, links, and link availability, are derived from analyzing the network synthesis method results for networks with maximum availability. Network availability limits (dependent on network topology) can be computed using these approximation functions. Furthermore, these functions can define the boundaries within which link numbers need to fluctuate to achieve the desired availability through appropriate network topology selection. It has been demonstrated that for maximum network availability, all nodes should have equal connectivity, or vary by one at most. With this rule and a predetermined link limit in the network, the network design process can be executed in several iterations to reach the network topology that guarantees the requested availability. The approximation functions defined in this dissertation do not rely on network size, enabling extensive calculations and analysis of numerous input parameter combinations. It has been proven that these approximation functions are more precise than previously published functions. The calculated approximate values were compared with exact availability values, revealing that the relative approximation error is significantly less than 1% for networks with link availability exceeding 0.75.
