A literature review identified multiple perspectives on the notion of performance. The shared aspect among most interpretations is that performance relates to behaviors or actions contributing to organizational goal achievement, which can be quantified. Performance indicators are crucial management tools that guide management towards beneficial long-term strategies and efficient short-term decision-making. Current and historical performance are gauged through financial indicators to predict future business activities. Financial indicators are intrinsically linked with performance indicators from other business functions. Performance management acts as a higher-order management system that integrates other systems and forms the foundation for appropriate managerial decision-making. This thesis aims to explore the potential link between an organization's financial and business performance. The organization's success is gauged by a widely accepted approach. The core hypothesis that a correlation exists between business success and financial performance indicators has been verified through a review of secondary sources and empirical research conducted on the most successful companies over a five-year period. The results indicate that the financial performance indicators for most successful companies tend to cluster at certain intervals. The data's statistical analysis revealed a distinct correlation between certain financial performance indicators and the company's age and industry. Consequently, empirical research discovered a statistically significant disparity between the values of certain financial performance indicators in more and less successful organizations. Based on the research analysis, a new management concept grounded in financial performance indicators has been formulated.
