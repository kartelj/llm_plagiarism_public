Three-dimensional (3D) videos are increasingly prevalent in both wired and wireless networks, placing a significant strain on network capacity due to their high data content. The effect of 3D video on network traffic necessitates the enhancement of methods to manage this form of data. The focus of this thesis is the fractal and multifractal analysis of 3D video formats, aiming to demonstrate that 3D videos possess fractal and multifractal characteristics, describe these properties, compare them across different 3D formats, and explore potential applications in traffic modeling of 3D video formats and in the creation of improved transportation techniques for video smoothing and statistical multiplexing. Algorithms and software implementations for mathematical methods in the field of complex systems and chaos were created in Matlab and Python, to determine fractal properties (the aggregated variance method, the R/S statistic method, and the multiscale method) and multifractal properties (the method of moments for multifractal spectra, estimation of the generalized dimensions, and the histogram method for multifractal spectra and inverse multifractal analysis). The findings confirm the fractal and multifractal characteristics of 3D video formats, compare them for a variety of 3D video formats, video structures, frame types, encoder quantization parameters values, frame aggregation, and video streaming methods.
