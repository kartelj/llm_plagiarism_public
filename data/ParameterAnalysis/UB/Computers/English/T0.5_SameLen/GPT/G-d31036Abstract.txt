This doctoral thesis primarily focuses on a classification model, aiming to create a system based on case-based reasoning (CBR) and intelligent selection of similarity measures to enhance the accuracy of classifying new cases. The thesis explores the potential of utilizing domain knowledge, expressed through preference functions, to boost the predictive capacity of a CBR system. It also investigates if a model that employs specific similarity measures for categorical data, combined with preference functions for numerical data comparison, can outperform the conventional k-NN CBR model. In every CBR model, measuring similarity between cases is crucial. Traditional CBR models use the Euclidean metric for numerical variables and overlap function for categorical attributes. Preference theory functions offer more flexibility in expressing decision-makers' preferences and can be used for case comparison. The thesis will present the outcomes of classification models that use specific similarity measures for categorical attributes and preference functions for numerical attributes. It covers attribute weight optimization and the impact of the number of nearest neighbors considered on the models' predictive power. A genetic algorithm sets the parameters of each preference function and attribute weights. The model's performance is assessed on three separate benchmark datasets of clients seeking credit application consideration. The models' accuracy is evaluated using a 10-fold cross-validation test, with cross-validation folds generated using a seed for data randomization. The experimental findings confirm that the proposed methods with preference theory functions consistently surpass the traditional k-NN classifier, irrespective of the similarity measures for categorical attributes used. However, models employing preference theory functions and varying similarity measures for categorical data reveal that each dataset has a most effective technique, which includes an appropriate similarity measure for categorical attributes alongside preference theory functions.
