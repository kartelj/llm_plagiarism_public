The evolution of modern network environments, their usage, and their compatibility with other technologically diverse concepts, relies on the use and adaptability of various heterogeneous technologies. This intricate network environment is constantly facing numerous operational issues, with the protection and safeguarding of services and data being a critical task. The steady rise in user numbers and the rapid creation of new applications demanding high bandwidth have set new standards for security systems, which rely on monitoring and effectively comprehending network traffic characteristics. In view of the escalating growth in cyberattacks, continuous dynamic changes in network traffic, and the growing diversity of technologies and devices used, the creation of solutions in the field of anomaly and attack detection has become essential. Despite numerous papers in the existing literature discussing the analysis of network traffic flows for monitoring network performance and security, only a few studies focus on generating network traffic behavior profiles or specific communication patterns. In this context, network behavior analysis depends on understanding normal or acceptable behavior patterns, which would enable effective detection of unusual, anomalous behavior patterns. Unlike intrusion detection systems that rely on packet payload or signature (signature-based), this approach is extremely beneficial not only for identifying unknown threats, zero-day attacks, and suspicious behavior, but also for enhancing overall network performance. This dissertation suggests a new method for detecting attacks and anomalies, which relies on profiling network traffic using only IP addresses and port numbers collected via the NetFlow protocol. The proposed solution involves a specific preprocessing of network traffic flows by applying entropy calculation over certain traffic flow attributes. Then, through aggregation techniques, additional attributes are calculated, reflecting the communication activity of participants within a given time interval - epoch. By further transforming the generated attributes, several characteristic signatures are formed, describing network traffic profiles. Then, using the enhanced hierarchical clustering algorithm, traffic instances are grouped according to the defined profiles. The dissertation provides a comprehensive review of the issues in detecting and identifying anomalies and attacks in modern network environments and applies a systematic approach to resolving these issues, starting from the defined hypotheses, analyzing network traffic flow characteristics, and then suggesting a new solution combining various techniques. It involves preprocessing network traffic flows, calculating attribute value entropy, aggregating them, generating specific network traffic profile signatures, and applying a modified hierarchical agglomerative clustering (HAC) algorithm. The primary aim is to allow quick and efficient processing of real network environment data, in cases of working with unlabeled, incomplete, and different flow lengths. The proposed solution assumes that each data flow includes specific information and volumetric attributes, while the use of special aggregation techniques generates additional attributes, the so-called behavioral attributes. Similar to entropy-based techniques, in this case, aggregation is applied over each data flow, with these preprocessed attributes then being interpreted as a separate signature of the communication flow. One of the dissertation's objectives is to find a method that would enhance entropy-based techniques using different machine learning algorithms, relying on the proposal of two new approaches.
