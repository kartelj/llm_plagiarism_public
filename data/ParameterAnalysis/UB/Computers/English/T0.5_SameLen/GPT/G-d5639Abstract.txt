In the Introduction section, we establish our research area and primary objectives, highlight key hypotheses and research methods, and offer a comprehensive overview of the dissertation, underscoring significant elements of our work. The second section is dedicated to understanding efficiency and its evaluation and measurement methods. Efficiency, a fundamental element in modern business decision-making (Savić, 2011), is described as the ability to minimize input to maximize output (Amado et al., 2011). In organizations using one input to define one output, efficiency is calculated as output divided by input. However, the challenge arises when measuring efficiency of systems using various inputs to produce different outputs (Thanassoulis et al., 2012). This research aimed to develop a unique statistical efficiency model capable of handling diverse input/output variables, requiring the consolidation of all indicators into a single value. The challenge lies in overcoming the fact that variables are measured in different units and determining appropriate weighting factors. The Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) method, often used and explained here, was devised by Charnes, Cooper & Rhodes (1978) to measure efficiency, particularly in non-profit organizations. This method suggests a nonparametric approach to efficiency evaluation, integrating multiple inputs and outputs into one virtual input and output. The weighting issue was resolved by allowing each Decision Making Unit (DMU) to set its own weights, all with the aim of maximizing its efficiency. The only constraint was that weights must be positive, and the quotient of virtual outputs and virtual inputs cannot exceed 1 (Martić, 1999). In addition to the DEA method, the dissertation also discusses the Stochastic Frontier Analysis (SFA), an alternative approach to measuring efficiency using extensive econometric models. The third chapter shifts focus to multivariate data analysis, explaining how multiple observations are collected on a large number of variables. Multivariate data analysis allows us to analyze complex data sets with many interdependent and independent variables. This chapter mainly focuses on two important statistical methods: principal component analysis (PCA) & factor analysis, and cluster analysis. Factor analysis and PCA are commonly used to identify a relatively small number of factors representing complex interrelations between all variables. These methods are useful in identifying hidden dimensions of observed phenomena. The main difference between these two methods is the way they examine data. Factor analysis is primarily concerned with covariance, while PCA examines variances. Both have similar goals and procedures, so factor analysis can be viewed as a special case of PCA (Bulajić, 2002). Significant attention is also given to cluster analysis as a method of multivariate data analysis, often used to group objects so that similar objects form a group distinct from other groups. Objects are clustered based on similarity, defined in various ways. The dissertation's primary aim was to create a new statistical efficiency model based on the I-distance method. Therefore, the fourth chapter focuses on the I-distance metrics in n-dimensional space, proposed and defined by Prof. Dr. Branislav Ivanović (Ivanović 1972, 1973, 1977; Ivanović & Fanchette, 1973). As a leading expert in the Statistical Department of the United Nations (UN) and its agencies such as UNCTAD and FAO (United Nations Conference on Trade and Development – UNCTAD; Food and Agriculture Agency - FAO), Prof. Ivanović developed this method to rank countries according to a large number of variables. Various socio-economic indicators were considered, and the key challenge was to use all of them to create one synthesized indicator representing the rank. The proposed solution was based on creating a fictitious entity with the minimum values for each indicator/variable and measuring the distance of other entities in the observed data set from the fictitious entity. With the help of the coefficient of partial correlation, a rank list is formed. I-distance meets all 13 conditions to be declared as a metric. A key argument for using the I-distance method is its ability to integrate a large number of different measured variables into one value. The dissertation focuses particularly on the applications of the I-distance method. Perhaps the most significant application was the use of the I-distance method to rank the world's best universities according to the Academic Ranking of World Universities – ARWU and SCImago methodologies (Scopus Journal Ranking). The improved I-distance method was highlighted as a significant contribution to the issue, as it easily solves the problem concerning subjectively given weighting factors for variables/indicators. Besides these applications, the dissertation presents the issue of evaluating the socio-economic development of countries, the health of nations, and the ranking of sports teams. All these case studies have been verified in leading scientific journals. The fifth chapter is based on a new statistical efficiency model based on the I-distance method. In the dissertation, this model is called Distance Based Analysis – DBA, and it has been verified through many examples published in leading journals. The DBA method was used to measure the efficiency of university scientific output, the banking sector, the health sector, and the efficiency of regions in Serbia. The proposed method provided interesting results and insights, which were later checked with the DEA method. The dissertation significantly improved the corpus of methods for measuring efficiency. The dissertation also made significant progress regarding the I-distance method, as the algorithm for selecting the first solution of the method and the order of variable inclusion was significantly improved. Since the idea of the I-distance method is to integrate many different types of measurement variables into one value, it is crucial that the maximum amount of information is covered by the I-distance. In the dissertation, it was shown that the initial solution based on the sum of absolute correlations converges to the final solution quite quickly. The suggested improved method provides better results, as the obtained solution incorporates the maximum amount of input variables/indicators. The improvement of the method is reflected in the fewer steps needed for the final solution to appear. Finally, conclusions with responses to each research issue and hypothesis were provided. A proper systematization of the scientific contributions and possibilities for further research is also elaborated. Extensive literature is provided, and in the Appendix, results concerning the I-distance method improvement experiment were provided.
