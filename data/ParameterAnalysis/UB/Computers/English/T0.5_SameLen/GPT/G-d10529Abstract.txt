Human resource development heavily relies on knowledge. It is essential for both individuals and businesses to apply modern understanding to remain competitive and viable. Education, both formal and informal, is where we obtain knowledge, whether it's in schools, colleges, or the workplace, and can be traditional or online. Currently, e-learning and e-education are receiving significant focus in the scientific community, utilizing the latest information-communication technologies. This PhD research investigates the use of informal e-learning methods through Web 2.0 tools, and the advantages of incorporating them into formal education. While e-learning methods are fairly recognized, their application is lacking, especially in our context. This paper examines how implementing informal e-learning techniques using Web 2.0 tools (e-learning 2.0) can enhance human resource potential. The concept of a personal learning environment is used to structure informal e-learning 2.0 with a shift towards pedagogy 2.0. This change involves moving from a teacher-controlled environment with a rigid learning regime to a more social, collaborative approach focusing on task design and student involvement, and a learner-centered approach. A pedagogical model for a personal e-learning 2.0 environment is created and tested through an action research study to verify these concepts. A survey is conducted to assess knowledge of Web 2.0 tools and analyze their use in learning. The participants are students from the Faculty of Organizational Sciences, covering all years and disciplines. The findings suggest that the application of informal e-learning 2.0 in colleges is heavily influenced by students' individual traits and potentials, their field of study, and the organization of their courses. Fourth-year students studying information systems and technologies are identified as an ideal population to test the model. To further investigate the potential use of personal learning environments (PLE) in formal education as a method of structuring informal e-learning 2.0, an action research study is conducted in the E-Learning course at the Faculty of Organizational Sciences. A pedagogical PLE model for e-learning 2.0 is created for this purpose. This model represents a new approach to designing a personal learning environment for e-learning 2.0 and structuring informal e-learning 2.0. An activity algorithm is also developed as part of the model to guide its implementation in the teaching process. The results demonstrate that the pedagogical PLE model for e-learning 2.0 can be applied in formal education. Most students responded positively to this learning structure, finding it creative and interesting. In conclusion, it is possible to innovate formal education using a pedagogical PLE model for e-learning 2.0 based on informal learning. This approach can potentially enhance the development of human resources, preparing future employees for a modern working environment.
