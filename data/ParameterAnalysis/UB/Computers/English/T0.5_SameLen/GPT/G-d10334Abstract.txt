The primary aim of this research is to suggest and empirically test a comprehensive model of retail consumer loyalty in Serbia. An examination of literature on key factors of service consumer loyalty, such as service quality, satisfaction, and perceived value, preceded the main research. The research was conducted using a structured survey, on a convenience sample of 737 retail consumers in non-specialist, food-dominant stores, employing multivariate data analysis techniques, executed through software packages SPSS 18 and LISREL 8.80. The outcomes of exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis suggest the multidimensional nature of service quality construct within the Serbian retail context. Four dimensions of retail service quality were identified as follows: (F1) Employee behavior and appearance, (F2) Atmospherics, (F3) Customer communication, and (F4) Space arrangement and variety. Structural equation modeling revealed customer satisfaction as the most critical determinant of customer loyalty, followed by perceived value, which had both direct and indirect effects on loyalty, mediated through satisfaction. This research's results also highlight the significant influence of service quality on customer loyalty. While this latent variable did not have a statistically significant direct effect on customer loyalty, it indirectly influenced customer loyalty, through the mediating variables of satisfaction and perceived value. The study's findings underline the importance of measuring and enhancing customer satisfaction and perceived value, as well as service quality, to build a loyal customer base. As the research was conducted on a convenience sample of retail consumers, future studies should focus on developing a service quality scale and measuring customer satisfaction and perceived value on a representative sample of Serbian retail consumers.
