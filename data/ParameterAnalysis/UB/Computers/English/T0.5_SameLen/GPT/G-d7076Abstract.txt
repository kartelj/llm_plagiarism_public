The thesis research issue pertains to the vast data volume and information scarcity in reports for business reporting systems. Despite being abundant with charts and tables, reports merely contain data (their visual depictions) and scant or no information. Report users must manually decipher this data (by reviewing multiple reports) and, as a result, might miss crucial information due to: data overload, tiredness, lack of focus, inadequate knowledge or experience, subjectivity, or ill intent. This paper suggests automating the data-to-information conversion process. The recommended method is grounded on the principle that data becomes information when meaning (interpretation) is attached to it. Additionally, relevant (domain) knowledge is necessary to extract meaning from data. The suggested implementation of this method involves using expert system methods, techniques, and technologies to automate key performance indicator interpretation. Specifically, declarative knowledge is represented by classes, and procedural knowledge with rules and fuzzy theory. The information can be obtained through forward chaining and fuzzy inference, and then transformed into natural-language-like sentences using canned text. After examining the current state of business intelligence systems and expert systems, the recommended method is thoroughly explained from a theoretical perspective. This is followed by a discussion centered on the (possible) pros and cons of the solution, and then by the implementation plan. By showcasing the method with a prototype - PT application (PT - Enterprise Profit Interpretation Tutor), hypothesis testing and validation was facilitated. Reports provided by the application include data (in the form of graphics and tables) and also information (in the form of natural-language-like sentences). The evaluation involved a study in which the subjects were students who utilized PT as a learning tool. The findings indicate that students perceive PT as beneficial and relatively user-friendly. Report explanations are deemed helpful and easy to comprehend, but need to be more extensive. The majority of surveyed students believe that using the PT application somewhat enhances their knowledge and offers a quicker and slightly more engaging method of mastering profit interpretation. A comparative analysis of explanation facilities in contemporary tools for developing expert systems and business rules is also included in this paper. The JEFF explanation facility, which was developed to enable the prototype to function, is then introduced and evaluated. The evaluation was two-pronged and was conducted to determine whether goals have been met and where JEFF ranks in comparison to similar tools. It was confirmed that nearly all goals have been met and that JEFF is almost on par with the professional tool it was compared to. When consolidating all results, it can be concluded that the hypotheses are confirmed (indeed, the suggested methods and techniques can be effectively utilized for information creation), but that the recommended method was not tested in a corporate setting. The prototype that was developed demonstrates that the method is feasible to implement, but its efficacy was only assessed in the context of educational aids for students, not as a tool to assist managers in data interpretation. If the recommended method were to be employed in practice, it would be essential to design applications that cater to managers' needs and that would actually operate in a corporate setting.
