This thesis introduces a unique system for visualizing cryptographic algorithms, known as CryptOgraphic Algorithms visuaL simulAtion (COALA). The system's primary aim is to assist students new to data security in comprehending the foundational material on cryptographic algorithms, which underpin more complex topics. The University of Belgrade's School of Electrical Engineering offers a Data Security course that covers cryptographic algorithms, security protocols, applications, and system security. Exam results indicate students struggle with the cryptographic algorithms material, negatively affecting their overall exam performance. After investigating the root causes of this issue, it was concluded that implementing a system like COALA within the course's laboratory exercises could be a potential solution. Similar systems are commonly used in computer engineering and information systems courses that teach software-related topics. Prior to developing the new system, existing solutions were analyzed to determine if a system meeting the Data Security course's needs already existed and to define the necessary characteristics of such a system for successful educational use. Despite the plethora of algorithm visualization (AV) systems, few are suitable for visualizing cryptographic algorithms, and none fully meet the Data Security course's requirements. A methodology for developing such a system is proposed, based on a systematic review of existing AV systems, particularly those capable of visualizing cryptographic algorithms. The most efficient way to use the developed system in education, according to eLearning tools literature, is defined. The developed system allows for in-depth analysis of all cryptographic algorithms discussed in lecture and problem classes. It details the execution of supported algorithms, uses real-world algorithm parameter lengths, and allows for configurable input parameters to facilitate easy and fast demonstration of algorithm execution on various examples. The thesis includes overviews of the eLearning tools field, AV systems, and systems for visualizing cryptographic algorithms. It describes the cryptographic algorithms supported by the COALA system, which includes five types: substitution (Caesar, monoalphabetic, Playfair, Vigenere), transposition (Rail Fence, Row Transposition), production (Rotor Machine), symmetric block (DES, AES), and public-key (Diffie-Hellman, RSA). Special attention is given to explaining the visual representation used in COALA. The thesis presents a detailed functional description and software implementation details of the COALA system.
