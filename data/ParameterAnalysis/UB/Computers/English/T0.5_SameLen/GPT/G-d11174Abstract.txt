Managerial control is deemed a crucial tool for management, implementing corporate strategies, and enhancing a company's business operations. The effectiveness of this control largely hinges on the information available to decision-makers – data on past successes and forecasts of an organization's future standing and profits. Assessing past and predicting future accomplishments are areas explored within business performance measurement systems. Thus, the creation of a new or the application of an existing business performance measurement system is a vital foundation for effective decision-making. To meet managerial information needs, managerial accountants and experts from various managerial fields have endeavored to establish principles, concepts, techniques, and procedures for developing business performance measurement systems. Along with conceptual and procedural matters, current studies also tackle the challenges of creating specific business performance measurement systems. Despite over a decade of discussing these topics, the development and application of business performance measurement systems remain in their early stages. Therefore, both academia and management practice view them as a pressing issue, sparking lively discussions on the ideal business performance measurement system. This doctoral thesis aims to develop a new business performance measurement system. A specific goal is to identify factors that impact the system's construction – the number of performance measures to be incorporated into the system, and how the system should be utilized. A core theory defining this dissertation's scope is the contingency theory in management accounting. Thus, the study pinpointed a range of factors that influence the variety and application of the performance measurement system. Subsequently, the impact of performance measurement systems on organizational (financial and nonfinancial) success was analyzed. Primary data from the empirical study were used to validate the theoretical model. To the author’s knowledge, such a study has never been conducted in Serbia before. Outside Serbia, only partial tests of a contingency factor's impact on business performance systems have been conducted, but never as thoroughly and in the format presented in this doctoral thesis. The findings suggest that Serbian companies utilize a relatively broad array of performance measures. The factors identified in the theoretical model influence both the variety and application of performance measurement systems. However, their significance greatly varies. Also, the balanced application of financial and nonfinancial performance indicators significantly impacts business success. These findings could be beneficial to other researchers in the fields of performance measurement, management control, and management accounting. Furthermore, the findings are highly beneficial for practitioners – consultants and managers – in building performance measurement systems in specific companies.
