Continuous education and ongoing training are fundamental aspects of the progress in today's society, driven by technological advancements and global business. The speed of education and learning has greatly increased, propelled by the evolution of IT and technological advancements, leading to the emergence of new scientific knowledge and applications, as well as new scientific disciplines. In the early 21st century, a new scientific field emerged, known as business intelligence, which aims to uncover data relationships in the field of education - Educational Data Mining. This field focuses on developing methods for analyzing and determining the validity of data from the educational field, using its methods to better understand student behavior and improve teaching progress. The PhD thesis explores the potential of applying business intelligence in education, with the aim of identifying key factors contributing to student success and enhancing the higher education process. The thesis aims to identify the most significant variables of a student, from their background and high school performance, to their success in the first year of undergraduate studies, and their correlation with overall academic success. The goal is to accurately predict academic success using business intelligence tools and techniques. The thesis thoroughly examines current research and knowledge in the field of educational data mining, particularly in higher education, and proposes a new approach for predicting performance indicators in higher education institutions. The thesis also proposes an original software solution for analyzing, monitoring, and predicting undergraduate student success, as part of an integrated knowledge and information exchange portal between students and faculty. By applying business intelligence methods and techniques, predictive models were developed and implemented to predict academic success, and the results were verified using the student database of the Faculty of Organizational Sciences at the University of Belgrade. The PhD thesis is divided into 12 chapters. The introduction presents the objectives, hypotheses, and research plan for the doctoral dissertation. The following two chapters provide an overview of business intelligence and data mining, including an analysis and systematization of knowledge and extensive research literature on data mining in higher education. The fourth chapter outlines the proposed research model, particularly the software support used for research implementation, as well as the data sources and structures used. The fifth chapter applies descriptive and comparative analysis to define data structures, dependencies, and correlations within the data. Chapters six to eight introduce the development of predictive models in the RapidMiner, Clementine, and Matlab software environments, using regression, decision trees, support vector machines, and artificial neural networks. The ninth chapter provides a comparative analysis of the performance of the previously developed predictive models, as well as the identification of attributes influencing academic success. The tenth chapter presents the basic structure and functionality of the information system for analyzing and monitoring higher education performance. The eleventh chapter summarizes the key findings and provides guidelines for further development and improvement of predictive models. The dissertation concludes with the twelfth chapter, which provides a bibliography overview. The dissertation includes two appendices. The first appendix provides a detailed specification of cases where the developed information system for analyzing and monitoring academic performance is used. The functionalities and options of the developed information system are presented through a detailed user interface presentation, with synthetic and analytical data analysis of performance and success factors presented in the second appendix. The dissertation presents a comprehensive research project in this area, applying business intelligence methods and techniques to analyze and predict undergraduate student success. This can support effective higher education management, helping institutions make decisions aimed at improving the educational process. The developed models can assist professors in early identification of students who need additional training or who have the ambition for continuous training and advanced education. The model can also be useful to students, providing insight into their potential success at university based on their existing learning, working, and evaluation habits. It can also benefit companies looking to identify potential future interns or employees. The final outcome of the thesis is the recommendation of using 14 models that achieve over 90% accuracy in predicting average study grades, average study duration, or professional course assessments in the fourth year of study, as well as the identified factors and variables crucial for determining academic success. The research findings will assist in analyzing the issue of introducing systems and models for predicting student success in higher educational institutions, as well as determining the detailed requirements that future students need to meet to achieve more and be more successful. The research findings can also be applied to other higher education systems (e.g., master's degree programs) with minimal modifications and updates, with the ultimate goal of enhancing and improving the entire academic education process. An integrated system for monitoring undergraduate student success was developed, which can assist higher education institutions in making informed decisions and directing training in the optimal direction when developing the curriculum. The research conducted in the thesis will help bring educational data mining closer to researchers in Serbia, as well as initiate the process of introducing systems and models for predicting student success in higher educational institutions.
