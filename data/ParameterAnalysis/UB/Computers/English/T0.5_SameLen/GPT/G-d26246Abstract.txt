Biometric technologies are increasingly being integrated into our modern society, becoming a daily aspect of life. Each biometric authentication system has unique requirements and constraints, dependent on the specific context of its use. Selecting the appropriate biometric modality, and a corresponding algorithm, requires careful evaluation of the biometric system's performance. This evaluation, however, is not always straightforward for both unimodal and multimodal biometric systems. Even with open biometrics databases available for assessment, system adaptation to the testing protocol of the selected database is necessary. The evaluation process becomes even more complex when the biometric system employs multiple modalities due to the variety of fusion algorithms. To address these challenges, this thesis introduces a comprehensive evaluation model for multimodal biometric systems, in the absence of a detailed model in existing literature. The proposed model is based on the MDA (Model Driven Architecture) paradigm and includes a metamodel of multimodal biometric system evaluation, constituting an ontology of terms in this field. A prototype framework for evaluating multimodal biometrics systems has been developed based on this model, enabling performance assessment of multimodal biometric systems in various use cases. Experimental evaluation results, using specific databases and algorithms, demonstrate that the framework reduces evaluation time to a quarter of the previously required time. Additionally, a novel analytical method for optimizing biometric system thresholds, based on predefined desired system behavior, has been developed. Lastly, a learning tool utilizing some of the framework's functionalities demonstrates how the framework can enhance the efficiency of training engineers in the field of biometrics.
