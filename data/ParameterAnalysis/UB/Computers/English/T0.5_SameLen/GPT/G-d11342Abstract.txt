Conducting commerce in today's landscape involves managing relationships with numerous stakeholders. Maintaining positive relations with these entities is considered a primary business objective, as a solid business network is perceived as a vital company asset. Communication, being an essential component of any relationship, is therefore seen as a crucial part of the company-stakeholder relationship. This is where strategic or corporate communications come into play, focusing on building and positioning the corporate brand, as validated in the thesis. The function of corporate communications in managing relationships is to unify and regulate all company communications. The concept of corporate branding, a topic of interest to both scholars and industry professionals, has been shown to influence business outcomes. It's seen as a key driver of sustainable competitiveness and a critical component of corporate strategy. In this context, corporate brand positioning is considered the company's overall strategy relative to its competitors, or how stakeholders perceive the company compared to its competition. The dissertation covers the specifics, types, and framework of corporate brand positioning after reviewing relevant literature on positioning and its application in corporate branding. Based on academic and professional literature and empirical research results, a strategic framework for managing corporate communications is established for the purpose of positioning the corporate brand. The author has developed a model for corporate brand positioning and established a measure known as CBPS (Corporate Brand Positioning Score) through empirical research. The study identified and measured business aspects affecting corporate brand positioning among 6 citizens/business community, the impact levels of certain business aspects on corporate brand positioning, and determined the model's structure and measured corporate brand positioning among citizens/business community. It also identified how demographic characteristics of citizens, or business community characteristics, influence the correlation between the perception of certain business aspects and corporate brand positioning. The research indicated that the perception of all defined components: Perception position, Attitude towards the company, Social responsibility, Management, Companies/Products, to varying degrees, influence corporate brand positioning among Serbian citizens. In modeling corporate brand positioning and determining the CBPS for the business community, corporate brand characteristics were used, which, for consistency with the previous part of the research, are referred to as determinants: Reliability, Neutrality, Efficiency, Independence, Adherence to principles, Good employee relations, Social responsibility, Understanding smaller companies, Professionalism, Credibility. From a corporate brand positioning perspective, nurturing identified determinants is crucial as their values impact the CBPS. The research findings highlight aspects vital for positioning the corporate brand among citizens and the business community, providing a foundation for strategic stakeholder communications.
