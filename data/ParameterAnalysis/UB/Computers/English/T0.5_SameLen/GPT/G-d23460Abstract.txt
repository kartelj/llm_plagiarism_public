Content created by users on internet forums is more frequently added than removed or modified, making its targeting during incremental crawling different from typical website page crawling. When new content is posted on a forum, it can shift existing content to new or already existing pages. Incremental forum crawling is not a straightforward task, as overlooking the manner in which content is displayed, distributed, and arranged can result in the transfer of posts that have been indexed in previous crawl cycles. Additionally, there is a broad range of forum technologies that provide various navigational paths to the most recent posts and diverse methods of displaying and sorting user-generated content.

This dissertation introduces a Structure-driven Incremental Forum crawler (SInFo) that specializes in targeting the most recent content in incremental forum crawling using advanced optimization methods and machine learning. The primary objective of the system presented is to bypass content that has already been indexed in new crawl cycles, regardless of its technology. To accomplish this, the following Web Forum features were utilized: (1) the sorting method on the index and thread pages, and (2) the navigational paths between pages offered by the current Web Forum technology. As the date of content creation is crucial in determining the sort type, identifying and normalizing it is not a simple task. Machine learning models were employed for this task, as the generated dates can vary in format and language. On the other hand, navigational path detection is achieved by interpreting the URL format and scanning the targeted pages.

The results indicate that using the suggested methods and techniques to target pages with the most recent content can minimize duplicate content downloads and maximize the use of the navigational structure and paths of the current forum technology. The tests were conducted on a wide variety of popular existing forum technologies as well as on individual stand-alone forum technologies. SInFo has shown high precision and a minimum number of duplicate content transfers in each new crawl cycle. Most of the duplicates that the proposed system encountered are from pages that had to be visited to accurately determine the navigational path or locate the correct URL. Additionally, while complex, the machine learning models achieved good performance during crawling and have high accuracy in date detection and normalization, reaching an F1-measure of 99%.
