This dissertation presents a model for interoperable e-business statistical systems based on service-oriented architecture and web services. The study is tailored for use in the statistical system of the Republic of Serbia. Official statistics serve as a critical component in the information system of any democratic society, providing data on economic, demographic, social, and environmental conditions. The primary role of official statistics is to accurately depict social and economic trends within a country. Additionally, it aims to offer a dependable basis for analysis and decision making at various levels, from government and institutional bodies to businesses and individuals. Official statistics in the Republic of Serbia operate according to principles outlined in the Economic-social council of the UN's document - basic principles of official statistics, as well as the European commission's document â€“ Practical codex of European statistics. Most countries possess one or more national statistical institutions (NSI) that collectively form the national statistical system of that country. The primary responsibilities of these systems include: collecting, storing, and analyzing statistical data, and disseminating the data to various user groups. Within each NSI, statistical production is carried out through different production lines and processes for various statistical areas. Typically, the business architecture of NSIs is based on the so-called stove-pipe model. In this model, a separate production line is established for each statistical area within the NSI. Each domain independently carries out the full production process, from research planning to data collection and analysis necessary for publication. Each domain has its own data, sources, and users. Electronic data exchange is a prevalent method of communication among statistical services, however, it is continually hindered by a lack of interoperability and the need for data conversion. This dissertation suggests the adoption of universal standards for statistical data sharing and exchange. The primary objective is to develop a set of widely accepted standards to facilitate rapid and immediate access to data and metadata. The service-oriented architecture of the statistical information system allows for interoperability at both the application and business process levels. Semantic level interoperability is achieved by designing a common domain ontology and developing a common data model based on domain ontology.
