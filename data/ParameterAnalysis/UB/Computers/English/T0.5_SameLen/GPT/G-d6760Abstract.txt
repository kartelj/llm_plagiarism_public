This thesis examines the use of contemporary software engineering techniques in open source software creation for intelligent systems. The main outcomes are a universal software framework model and advice for managing open source projects in this area. The framework model and project management suggestions were created and tested in real-world scenarios through the enhancement of a chosen software framework for neural networks. The selected neural network framework is a top-tier Java open source neural network framework. The proposed software development techniques can also be applied in other areas of intelligent systems and are solutions to issues and unique needs in this field. Many of the challenges stem from the fact that the software is frequently used for research purposes, should also be practical for real-world problems, and the intricacy of the software which should also be user-friendly and modifiable. The suggested development techniques are associated with requirements specification, planning, design, implementation, and maintenance. They are presented as proven effective recommendations. Besides these theoretical and methodological contributions, this thesis also offers practical contributions in the form of new features for a chosen framework in the field of intelligent systems, significantly improving its practical use.
