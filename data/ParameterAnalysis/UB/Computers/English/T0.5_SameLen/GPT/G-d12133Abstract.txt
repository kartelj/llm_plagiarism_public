Assessing the work needed to establish a software system is among the most challenging yet crucial tasks in software engineering. The effort estimate often dictates whether the project will commence, under what constraints it will be carried out, and if it will be successfully finished and utilized. The truth is, these estimates are typically made on incomplete requirements using a variety of heuristics, assumptions, and experience, where the best possible estimates are needed within a restricted timeframe. Despite significant progress in different areas of software engineering in recent years, effort estimation methods predominantly rely on the subjective evaluation by project teams or experts, with the errors in effort estimate often exceeding expectations. Worldwide statistics reveal that only a third of software projects are successfully completed, a third do not meet the budget and deadlines, while the remaining projects fail. One of the primary reasons for these outcomes is inaccurate effort estimates. The objective of this thesis is to scrutinize the current effort estimation methods and suggest new ones that can enhance effort estimation. The fundamental concept to be discussed in the thesis involves the use of novel models and techniques to better the existing effort estimation methods. The thesis will present suggestions for enhancing current assessment methods and specific results that can be achieved using these solutions on actual software projects. Improvements are limited to identifying project parameters that most affect the effort, as well as establishing the relationships between the parameters and the effort.
