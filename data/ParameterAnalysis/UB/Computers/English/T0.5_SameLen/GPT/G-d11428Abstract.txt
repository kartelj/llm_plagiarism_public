The routing strategy selected in a packet network greatly influences the reliability and overall data transmission quality. The chosen routing strategy also affects the utilization of various network resources, and poor routing decisions can lead to network bottlenecks and limit throughput. Furthermore, network latency and cost are also dependent on the selected routing scheme. To identify the optimum routing strategy for the expected traffic and given network, routing optimization is carried out. The aim of routing optimization is to achieve the best possible value for the chosen network performance metric. Depending on the problem at hand, optimization can be performed to maximize network throughput, minimize network cost, minimize latency, etc. 
In this study, we will address network throughput maximization and network cost minimization issues. We will concentrate on non-blocking networks, which ensure service to all users generating and receiving traffic within defined limits, regardless of the current traffic distribution in the network. In this study, we will suggest a new routing scheme, based on load balancing and shortest path routing, referred to as load balanced routing (LBR). This proposed routing protocol can be optimized using linear programming to minimize cost or maximize network throughput.
The suggested routing scheme can be easily implemented in practice. Specifically, shortest path routing is commonly used, and the proposed routing is a modification that can be implemented relatively easily. The linear program's dimension is acceptable, as is the time required to perform the optimization. With the proposed routing, it's possible to guarantee service to a larger number of users than with regular shortest path routing. Also, the cost of servicing a certain number of users is less if the proposed routing is used instead of shortest path routing.
Firstly, we will present the proposed load balanced routing and the linear program for its optimization. We will then evaluate the performance of the proposed routing scheme and compare it to the performance of shortest path routing. Specifically, we will look at two cases. In the first, we will optimize load balanced routing to achieve maximum network throughput. It will be demonstrated that the proposed load balanced routing can significantly boost the guaranteed network throughput compared to regular shortest path routing. In the second case, we will optimize load balanced routing to achieve the lowest possible network cost that can support given user demands. It will be demonstrated that the cost of a network with load balanced routing is less than the cost of a network using shortest path routing.
We will conduct analyses for both regular and realistic network topologies. Furthermore, we will conduct analyses for networks requiring service reliability in the event of a single resource (link or router) failure. It will be demonstrated that the performance of the proposed load balanced routing is superior to the performance of shortest path routing in all these cases.
