Wireless mesh networks (WMNs) represent an emerging trend in wireless communication, offering more flexibility, dependability, and superior network performance than conventional wireless local area networks. The design of WMNs must consider the rising demand for rapid, efficient data transfer and multimedia transmission (voice and video), with key challenges including enhancing throughput (via the multi-channel multi-interface (MCMI) method in the WMN), and considering the quality of service (QoS). Optimizing network performance requires the establishment of protocols and routing metrics to identify the best path between the source and destination nodes. Given the high signal dynamics of the WMN, particularly in complex environments (from a radio coverage perspective) like indoor settings, this dissertation proposes routing metrics capable of quickly adapting to changes in propagation conditions at each network link. The link costs of the three new metrics, powerETX (Expected Transmission Count), powerWCETT (Weighted Cumulative Expected Transmission Time) and powerMIC (Metric of Interference and Channel-switching), incorporate a parameter dependent on the received signal level, in addition to the parameters defined in the existing ETX, WCETT, and MIC metrics. Compared to existing metrics, these new ones offer higher data throughput and reduced average end-to-end delay, and can be implemented without extra hardware and minimal software modifications. Recognizing that existing channel assignment (CA) algorithms lack QoS support in MCMI-WMNs and that multimedia transmission may experience unacceptable delays, this dissertation proposes a new link layer protocol, QoS-HMCP (QoS Hybrid Multi-Channel Protocol), which integrates QoS support via the EDCA (Enhanced Distributed Channel Access) mechanism and leverages the positive attributes of the hybrid CA algorithm defined by the HMCP protocol for the link layer. Four QoS-HMCP protocol versions, considering different channel switching criteria and medium competition procedures, are proposed. These versions are compared to the basic HMCP protocol in terms of user data throughput and network delay, justifying the introduction of QoS support into the MCMI network. Finally, the dissertation concludes which QoS-HMCP protocol version yields the best results (highest throughput with least delay) for different traffic categories and network conditions, based on a direct comparison. Additionally, this dissertation contributes a comprehensive, systematic review of existing routing protocols, channel assignment strategies, and routing metrics for multi-channel multi-interface WMNs.
