Current trends in computer design are focused on enhancing the performance of computer systems to the maximum level to cater to the requirement of processing vast data volumes. The design of a processor, the main player in data processing, is the primary focus. However, the growth trends in processor performance as per Moore's Law have been decelerating lately due to the physical constraints of semiconductor technology, making performance enhancement increasingly challenging. This issue is being countered with various techniques intended to boost performance without increasing transistor and power usage. This thesis explores asymmetric multicore processors with transactional memory support. Two novel techniques to enhance the performance of such processors are proposed. One technique seeks to mitigate transaction congestion due to high parallelism by moving transactions to a faster core. The transactions causing the most congestion are chosen for migration. Running them on a quicker core decreases their likelihood of conflict with other transactions, thus raising the chances of congestion avoidance. Another technique modifies the cache subsystem to decrease cache access latency and reduce the risk of false conflicts while decreasing the number of transistors needed for cache implementation. This can be accomplished by using small, straightforward caches. Detailed proposals for implementing both techniques are provided. Prototypes of these techniques were created in the Gem5 simulator, which accurately models a processor's system. Using these prototypes, the proposed techniques were assessed by simulating numerous applications from a standard benchmark set for transactional memory. The analysis of the simulation results provided recommendations on when and how the suggested techniques should be implemented.
