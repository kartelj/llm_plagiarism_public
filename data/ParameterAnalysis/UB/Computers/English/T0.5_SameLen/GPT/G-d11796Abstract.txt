Wireless sensor networks comprise several small computing devices, known as sensor nodes. Each sensor node is equipped with one or more sensors for data collection from the environment and can establish radio communications with other nodes within the network. Wireless sensor networks generate vast amounts of data, making them ideal for implementing machine learning methods. The objective of this work is to adapt certain data mining algorithms for distributed execution, enabling them to run directly on the sensor nodes.

Analysis of the problem has led to three fundamental requirements for a distributed data mining algorithm suitable for use in a wireless sensor network. Firstly, it is crucial to minimize the communication between the nodes, as communication consumes significant energy. Secondly, the algorithm must produce precise results. Lastly, reliance on centralized computational resources should be minimized as much as possible.

The primary contribution of this thesis is the development of two innovative algorithms for distributed machine learning, tailored to meet the demands of executing in a wireless sensor network. The first algorithm is a two-layer classification scheme. The initial layer runs on the sensor nodes and can employ any classifier type (the method was tested using J48 decision trees). The outcomes of this stage are then forwarded to a centralized, second layer classifier based on a weighted voting scheme. The second algorithm is a clustering algorithm based on Kohonen neural networks. The network's architecture is adapted to the nature of the data obtained from the sensor nodes in wireless sensor networks. Such data contain two variability sources: the location information of a detected event and the properties of that event. Accordingly, the proposed Kohonen neural network consists of two layers, the first clustering data according to the origin location, and the second clustering data based on the event type.

Calculations indicate that both proposed algorithms result in significant energy savings. The algorithms' accuracy was confirmed through computational simulations. In conclusion, the proposed algorithms are suitable for numerous practical applications, and the machine learning methods provide a feasible approach to constructing sustainable large wireless sensor networks.
