The cloud computing sector has seen substantial growth over the last ten years. This study assesses a variety of cloud settings and services offered to clients. Several issues in cloud usage have been identified, posing significant challenges for users. Even before cloud technology was a factor, users and administrators of relational databases faced multiple issues. Issues like software upgrades for relational databases services on a cloud platform fell to the service provider. This marked a notable improvement that cut operational expenses. Nevertheless, service enhancement and query optimization issues escalated due to the number of relational databases and the increased abstraction introduced by the cloud setting. In the cloud setting, detailed service usage data is continuously collected. A system is proposed here that uses this data to help users understand how the relational database operates and more easily identify problem sources. After analyzing related work in detail, the system is thoughtfully designed and developed. It incorporates two types of statistical data models for recall and precision, and a decision-making expert system. The appropriate infrastructure is built on a microservice architecture. The project team was comprised of several members with diverse skills. The system is implemented on the Microsoft Azure platform, with some specifics of this implementation also detailed. The system underwent comprehensive testing and evaluation using real data workload from the Azure SQL relational database's production environment over six months. The results indicated a significant improvement in query execution performance. Feedback from customers who used this service demonstrated a substantial enhancement in user experience. The conclusion provides a project overview, suggests system improvement ideas, and discusses how similar methods can be applied in scientific fields.
