The piece delineates a methodological strategy for constructing a telecommunications company's information system, grounded in models and merging general IS development methodologies with a specific telecommunication initiative. This includes: MDA (Model Driven Architecture), a software development approach standardized and advocated by OMG (Object Management Group); EA (Enterprise Architecture), a method for concurrent Business and IT Architecture development, with TOGAF (The Open Group Architectural Framework) being the most recognized enterprise architecture development framework; NGOSS (New Generation Operations Systems and Software), a Telemanagement Forum initiative representing a framework for developing and implementing "Operation and Business Support Systems – OSS/BSS" within the telecommunications industry; and SPL (Software Product Line), a modern approach to domain-specific model-driven software development automation, focusing on a software product family rather than a single product. The methodology is grounded in a telecom-specific software product line, utilizing NGOSS frameworks and models, enabling efficient Telecommunication Company IS construction via three separate processes: General domain engineering, Domain engineering for service types, and Application engineering. To establish a model-driven telecom operator IS development framework, an understanding of the complexity dimensions in telecommunication domains is required: Functional Domains, Integrated Process Areas, Telecommunication Services Types, IS Development Life-Cycles Phases, and Specific Telecom Operators IS. Subsequently, the interrelationships and dimension-shifting sequences must be defined. An initial classification scheme for the telecommunication domain, including sub-domains and their interdependencies, was established based on the eTOM and SID NGOSS Framework. A mechanism called "Multi-level Staged Configuration" was defined to manage the complexity of the telecommunication domain and facilitate transitions between sub-domains. Applying this mechanism to the initial classification scheme results in a system for multi-level staged configuration of the telecommunication domain. This allows for a telecommunication domain software product line framework to be defined that, through domain and application engineering, encompasses all previously mentioned domain complexity dimensions. This approach necessitates specific domain engineering due to the multidimensional complexity of the telecommunication domain, comprising two levels: General domain engineering and Domain engineering for service types. The General domain engineering process includes defining the Horizontal Multi-level Staged Configuration (HMLSC) system, responsible for the comprehensive definition of all initial Features Models by telecommunication domain functional areas. This system is implemented through four HMLSC schemes, with models within a functional area being horizontally interdependent and constructed according to defined sub-domain dependencies. In addition to Feature Models, all necessary UML model patterns are defined: Data Model Templates, Behavior Templates, etc. Another crucial step of General domain engineering is defining the Vertical Multi-level Staged Configuration (VMLSC) system, implemented through six configuration schemes. The primary outcome of Vertical Multi-level Staged Configuration execution is vertical processes development through multi-level staged Feature Model transformation, where the previous level's result is input for lower-level model construction. The next important step is defining the Model Generation system. Features Models represent common and different features of product families. However, they are not self-serving. They guide the construction of domain-specific data or behavior models, meaning feature models should be mapped into other models to convey the necessary semantics. This mapping is performed through model generation schemes. Domain engineering for type of service in the telecommunication domain is also discussed. In this section of the Software Product Line (SPL) for the telecommunication domain, the configuration schemes for Horizontal Multi-level Staged Configuration (HMLSC), defined in General Domain engineering, are further elaborated. These schemes typically define rules and a path for service type model definition. Using these schemes, all initial Feature Models for the IPTV service are defined by telecommunication domain functional areas. In the second section, the schemes defined in General Domain Engineering for the telecommunication domain that form the System for Vertical Multi-level Staged Configuration (VMLSC) are further elaborated. These schemes typically define rules and a path for End-to-End Processes definition for service type. Using these schemes, Feature Models are mutually annotated, and a vertical processes development procedure for the IPTV service is defined. In this domain process section, schemes for automated configuration and UML model generation of class diagrams and activity diagrams for the IPTV service are also defined, based on IPTV UML model templates and Feature Model configurations. Application engineering for the telecommunication domain enables the specification and generation of a specific operator’s IS. This part, like the entire methodological approach, is illustrated through step-wise tailoring and generation of a specific IS for a specific IPTV service operator. Configuration of a specific operator’s IS request is performed first, followed by detailed IS tailoring using Vertical Multi-level Staged Configuration. During this process, generation of a specific telecom operator’s IS models is performed. This model-driven methodological approach to telecommunication company IS development addresses several IS development issues: IT and Business Alignment resolution, a problem arising from differences in abstraction levels of Business and IT concepts; overcoming the Multidimensional complexities of the telecommunication domain; resolving the problem of IS development caused by Business Dynamism, as Business is not only complex but also highly dynamic due to constant and rapid technology switches, new service user requests, market competition, etc.; allowing mass customization of services, an issue unresolved by existing methodological approaches due to the incomplete software reuse problem solution; supplementing general EA approaches and NGOSS domain EA with detailed telecommunication domain models that are functional with specific telecom operators, through use of the existing ISs; and enabling more efficient model transformation, one of the major general problems in the MDA approach. The piece concludes with a review and comparative overview of the advantages and disadvantages of the existing approaches and methods used in the thesis and discusses the advantages brought by the approach the thesis proposes. The automation of the presented methodological approach results in more efficient IS development, particularly considering the great potential of this approach to become the general methodology of IS development.
