This doctoral thesis centers on the exploration of virtual world potentials, specifically for research and educational applications. In this context, two primary aspects are investigated in the thesis. The first delves into the notion of autonomous agents, and the overarching agent theory, within the realm of virtual worlds. The second facet pertains to the educational uses of virtual worlds, with a particular emphasis on the idea of virtual laboratories. The thesis commences with a primer on the basic terminology pertinent to the topic. Following this, a comprehensive examination of the role of agents in virtual worlds is offered. This includes, among other things, an analysis of the methods that determine the agent's behavior. The creation of a dedicated virtual gamified educational system for agents is subsequently detailed in the thesis, complete with an exhaustive description. Lastly, an analysis of the virtual laboratory concept in STE (Science, Technology, and Engineering) fields is conducted, and existing solutions are assessed based on the criteria set out in the thesis.
