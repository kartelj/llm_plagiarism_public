The doctoral thesis primarily focuses on the realm of the information society, its progression, and the mechanisms for monitoring and assessing its advancements. The thesis encapsulates the existing studies and theories formulated on the subject of the information society, its evolution, multiple forms, factors influencing its growth, and various global initiatives aimed at steering the worldwide progression of the information society. This research investigates the potential to measure the complex concept of the information society, defined by a set of interrelated indicators, and identifies the most suitable metrics for observing, measuring, and evaluating the current state of the information society. Besides providing a classification and the evolutionary trajectory of the benchmarking indicators that form the foundation of any methodology aimed at quantifying the information society, this thesis includes an overview of the most pertinent methodologies used globally to evaluate the information society. However, the primary focus of this research is the creation of a unique model that outlines the necessary actions to monitor and assess the advancements in Serbia's information society. This model assumes: • theoretical foundation, • alignment with the European Union (EU) standards, facilitating its widespread use in projects involving international cross-country analyses and comparisons, • adherence to the specificities of Serbia's information society and its existing investment and development opportunities. The model's formulation involved: • choosing a set of Information Society Indicators (ISI) in line with EU standards, but modified to suit Serbia's attributes and development potential, • transforming the ISI set to enable their ranking based on their importance for monitoring the information society, • extracting a subset of the most relevant ISI, • Defining a sub-model that quantifies the digital divide extent through a unique compound indicator - Digital Polarization Index (DPI). The model was tested on Serbia, monitoring and analyzing its information society over a 5-year period. The verification process included: • statistical monitoring, quantification, and relevant data analysis, and • result analysis to determine the current state, identify and quantify 'critical points' in the development of Serbia's information society, and forecast its future progress. The thesis contributes professionally by evaluating Serbia's information society development from both the population and economy's perspective. Additionally, it quantifies and evaluates the intensity and trends of the digital divide and targets the most digitally underdeveloped groups within Serbia's population. The fundamental scientific contribution is the creation of a model to monitor and evaluate the development of the information society. This model uses the I-distance method and cluster analysis, two suitably combined multivariate analysis methods. The initial set of indicators was reduced to a subset of the most relevant ones, ranked based on their I-distance value and the application of cluster analysis. This subset includes the most significant indicators for assessing the information society, according to the 'information quantity'. By decreasing the number of indicators while retaining valuable information content, the model's practical applicability has significantly increased. Furthermore, the thesis defines a model for quantifying the individual and total digital divide in various areas by introducing the digital polarization index. The model's main features are its generality, flexibility, and openness for adding or altering its basic components. This allows for the identification, definition, and calculation of various individual sub-indices of digital polarization, used in calculating the total DPI (expressed by arbitrarily selected indicator sets and arbitrarily determined sample subgroups). Such model features are valuable given the rapid changes in the ICT area. The thesis's social contribution is the vast potential application of its results in monitoring and quantifying the information society, and in guiding and harmonizing its development. The model can serve as a strategic decision support tool and a tool for observing and minimizing the digital divide. Moreover, it can support the evaluation of various complex social phenomena outside the information society framework.
