As international operations globalize, managing intellectual capital becomes increasingly crucial. The prevailing notion is that effective management of intellectual capital is vital to an organization's success. Intellectual capital is now a key resource and operational base for modern organizations. In the early 1920s, the concept of intellectual capital became significant. Studying this concept significantly increases an organization's market value compared to its book value. Unlike tangible assets that depreciate with use over time, proper utilization of intellectual capital enhances an organization's value. Management is expected to identify and exploit opportunities and strengths, and minimize or eliminate weaknesses in the face of drastic environmental changes. This approach fosters the organization's growth and development. Intellectual capital holds operational and strategic importance for the organization. Today, organizations are increasingly interested in managing intellectual capital. Intellectual capital, a type of intangible asset, consists of human, structural, and relational capital. It encompasses not only the organization's knowledge but also staff competencies, organizational structure, business processes, intellectual property, corporate culture, and both internal and external resources (relationships with customers, suppliers, distributors, and other stakeholders). Intellectual capital includes factors not accounted for in official financial statements but essential for creating organizational values. Proper utilization of intellectual capital enhances the organization's value. Its qualitative dimension is more significant than the quantitative in creating added value. Intellectual capital is a guidepost for the future amidst dynamic environmental changes. This thesis aims to explore how organizations identify, evaluate, and report intellectual capital. It reviews relevant intellectual capital literature and previous studies on intellectual capital management practices in organizations. Empirical research within the thesis discusses the concept of intellectual capital in Serbian organizations and its importance for financial reporting. The study confirms the thesis hypothesis that adequate intellectual capital positioning is a leading performance indicator in the modern age, aiming to ensure information completeness. The conclusion emphasizes the need to value intellectual capital and present it in an additional financial statement for the most reliable and accurate representation of the organization's value. The existing financial statements and quantitative indicators lack precise scope for presenting necessary information. Therefore, quantified non-financial elements or descriptive forms can provide a clearer picture of the organization's value and potential.
