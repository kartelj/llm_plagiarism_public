The thesis research focuses on online frontier-based strategies for environmental exploration, employing the D* Lite algorithm for robotic path planning and utilizing multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) methods for next position selection. The decision-making process involves criteria such as collision-free path length, expected information gain, and base station distance. Exploration efficiency was gauged by the average robot path traveled, relative to multiple starting positions, for 90% environmental exploration. Matlab simulations demonstrated that under specified conditions, TOPSIS outperforms the other two MCDM methods (SAW and COPRAS) and four traditional strategies from literature in complex environmental exploration. This is attributed to TOPSIS maximizing Euclidean distance from the hypothetical worst solution, thereby minimizing decision-making risk in complex environments. Key findings were confirmed using the Gazebo 3D simulator and the Robot Operating System. Additionally, the thesis proposes two strategies to enhance robotic path planning in search and rescue missions. The first involves applying the D* Lite algorithm with fuzzy logic to determine map cell costs for robot path planning, avoiding binary values. This prioritizes object coverage in exploration and prevents mapping robots from obstructing others. The second strategy combines the D* Lite algorithm with online learning, reducing the mapping robot's path and minimizing risky movement by preemptively avoiding obstacles.
