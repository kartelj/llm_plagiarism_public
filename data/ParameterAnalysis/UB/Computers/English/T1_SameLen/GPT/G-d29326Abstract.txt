The evolution of contemporary network spaces, their usage, and the adaptability with other technologically assorted notions, is established on the utilization and congruence of varied heterogeneous technologies. Such an intricate network environment frequently faces numerous functional challenges, where the assurance of service and data security and safety denotes one of the pivotal tasks. The perpetual increment in user quantity and the robust evolution of novel applications necessitating extensive bandwidth has delineated new prerequisites for security systems, rooted in the surveillance and efficient comprehension of network traffic features. In view of the escalating development in cyberattack fields, tenacious dynamic alterations in network traffic, and the amplified heterogeneity of employed technologies and devices, creating solutions in the anomaly and attack detection field has become somewhat compulsory. Despite the vast literature recognizing a multitude of papers exploring network traffic flow analysis for network performance and security monitoring purposes, a handful studies are founded on procedures for generating network traffic behavior profiles or distinct communication patterns. In this regard, network behavior dissection depends on understanding typical or acceptable behavior patterns, which would facilitate the effective detection of unusual, anomalous behavior patterns. Unlike intrusion detection systems rooted in packet payload or signature (signature-based), this approach is extremely beneficial not only for identifying unknown threats, zero-day attacks, and suspect behavior, but also for enhancing overall network performance. This dissertation suggests a fresh method for attack and anomaly identification, founded on profiling network traffic using only IP addresses and port numbers obtained via the NetFlow protocol. The proposed solution is reliant on a distinct preprocessing of network traffic flows by performing entropy calculation over traffic flow instance attributes. Afterwards, some additional attributes reflecting participant communication activity in the observed epoch are calculated using aggregation techniques. Through further transformation of these generated attributes, several distinctive signatures describing networking traffic profiles are formed. Further, the enhanced hierarchical clustering algorithm is employed to group traffic instances according to established profiles.The dissertation offers a thorough review of anomaly and attack detection and identification issues in modern network landscapes and uses a methodical approach to address these issues, commencing from defined hypothesis, investigating network traffic flow traits, and suggesting a fresh solution combining various techniques. It encompasses processing network traffic flows, calculating attribute value entropy, aggregation, producing unique network traffic profile signatures, and employing a modified hierarchical agglomerative clustering (HAC) algorithm. The fundamental concept is to facilitate rapid and effective processing of actual network environmental data, in dealing with unlabeled, incomplete, and differing flow lengths. The suggested solution assumes each data flow includes certain informative and volumetric attributes, while the application of unique aggregation techniques creates additional attributes, termed behavioral attributes. Similar to entropy-based techniques, the aggregation is performed over each data flow, while the preprocessed attributes are regarded as separate communication flow signatures. One dissertation goal is to find a technique that would amplify entropy-based techniques with various machine learning algorithms application, derived from proposing two new approaches.
