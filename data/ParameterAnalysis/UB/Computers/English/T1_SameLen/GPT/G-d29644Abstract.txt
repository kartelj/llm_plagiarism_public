The thesis research pertains to on-line, frontier-based exploration strategies that utilize D* Lite algorithm for robotic navigation and employ multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) methods to determine the next location. The employed criteria in the decision-making process are the length of an obstacle-free route, prospective information gain, and distance from the base station. To gauge the effectiveness of the exploration, the average trajectory of the robot was calculated from diverse starting points suited for 90% environment exploration. MATLAB simulations confirmed that under specified conditions, the TOPSIS method outperforms other two scrutinized MCDM methods (SAW and COPRAS) as well as 4 traditional strategies from literature. This can be attributed to TOPSIS's ability to maximize the Euclidean distance from the hypothetically worst solution, thereby reducing the risk involved in decision making, especially in a complex environment. The key findings were corroborated using the Gazebo 3D simulator and the Robot Operating System. The thesis also suggests two innovative ways to enhance robotic navigation for search and rescue operations. The first strategy involves utilizing the D* Lite algorithm coupled with fuzzy logic, which enables the definition of map cell cost for robot navigation not restricted to binary values. This enables prioritized object exploration and prevents navigation robots from interfering with each other. The second strategy considers the amalgamation of D* Lite algorithm and on-line learning, allowing the robot's path to be shortened and its risky movement minimized as manoeuvres to bypass obstacles are completed ahead of possible encounters.
