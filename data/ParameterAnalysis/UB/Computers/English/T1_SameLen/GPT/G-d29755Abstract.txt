The field of cloud computing has seen considerable development over the past decade. The study discusses different cloud platforms and the services they offer clients. Use of the cloud has presented various challenges, many issues have been identified. Prior to the advent of the cloud, users and relational database administrators faced multiple problems. The responsibility of handling software updates of relational databases in a cloud setting shifted to service providers which was progress in reducing operational costs. Nevertheless, service enhancement and query optimization issues escalated due to an increase in the number of relational databases and the added complexity brought by the cloud environment. Crucial data regarding service usage in the cloud are consistently accumulated. A system is proposed that, using this data, makes understanding how relational databases function and identifying the root cause of issues easier for users. After an exhaustive review of relevant research, the system is meticulously planned and developed. It consists of two types of statistical data models for achieving recall and precision, as well as an expert system for final decision-making. The system employs a microservice infrastructure. The project team was a composite of several individuals with diverse skills. The system operates within the Microsoft Azure platform and some specific aspects of this implementation are shared. The system was thoroughly tested and analyzed using genuine data from the Azure SQL relational database over six months. The findings revealed a considerable enhancement in query execution performance. Users who availed this service reported a notable improvement in their experience. The culmination includes a review of the project, system enhancement suggestions, and a discussion on applying this approach in scientific sectors.
