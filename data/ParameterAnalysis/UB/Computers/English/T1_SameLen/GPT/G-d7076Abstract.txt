The problem of researching dissertations concerns the vast amounts of data and insufficient information included in business report systems. Reports, plentiful with graphs and tables, only consist of data (visibility in graphics) but meager or no information. Processing this data (through report analysis), report users may not discover key information due to excess data, fatigue, loss of focus, inadequate experience or knowledge, subjectivity, or malignancy. This paper offers an automation process for data-to-information conversion. The proposed technique rests on a relationship between data and information; data turn into information when meaning (interpretation) is provided. Furthermore, suitable (sector-specific) knowledge is critical to draw meaning from data. The proposed execution of this technique refers to application of methods, procedures, and technologies of an expert system to facilitate automated interpretation of key performance indicators. In particular, declarative knowledge is displayed in classes, and procedural knowledge through rules and fuzzy theory. Information could be obtained via forward chaining and fuzzy deduction and then transmuted into sentences resembling the natural language using canned text. Following a review of the current status in business intelligence and expert system sectors, the proposed technique is detailed theoretically, followed by a discussion of prospective pros and cons of the solution, and its execution plan. Implementation of a prototype - PT application (PT - Corporate Profit Interpretation Tutor), facilitated testing and validation of hypotheses. Reports generated by the application include data (graph and table formats) as well as information (natural language-like sentences). Evaluations were carried out through study involving students who utilized PT for educational support. Findings revealed that students find PT useful and moderately straightforward to navigate. Explanations in reports are viewed as beneficial and comprehendible but require more inclusivity. Most surveyed students assumed that PT participation to some degree helps bolster their skills, providing a faster and slightly more fascinating route to mastering profit interpretation. This paper also includes a contrastive analysis of explaining amenities in current tools used for the development of expert systems and business regulations. The JEFF explaining feature developed to aid the prototype is presented and evaluated. A double-fold evaluation was done to measure achievement of goals, and compare JEFF with similar tools. Nearly all objectives were accomplished, and JEFF fairly matched the professional tool it was compared to. Summarizing all results, hypotheses were confirmed (the proposed methods and techniques can be successfully employed to create information), but the proposed technique was not tested in a corporate setting. The prototype proves the feasibility of the proposed technique but was only rated as an educational aid for students, not as a tool for managerial data interpretation. If the proposed technique were to be put in practice, applications meeting manager needs and suited to a corporate environment would have to be created.
