As globalization expands, the management of intellectual capital is becoming increasingly vital. The prevailing view is that successful organizations effectively manage their intellectual capital, a critical resource and operational base. The significance of intellectual capital was recognized in the early twentieth century, and its study has increased the market value of organizations relative to their book value. Unlike physical assets, which depreciate with use, correctly utilizing intellectual capital raises an organization's value. Management is expected to identify and make the most of opportunities and strengths under changing conditions, while minimizing or eliminating weaknesses, leading to organizational growth and development. Intellectual capital holds operational and strategic value. Organizations are exhibiting growing interest in managing intellectual capital, comprised of human, structural, and relational capital. It encapsulates more than just organizational knowledge, including employee competencies, structure, business processes, intellectual property, and culture, along with key internal and external resources. Although not included in official financial statements, these factors contribute to organizational value, and proper use of intellectual capital enhances this value. Its qualitative dimension is more significant than the quantitative in creating added value. Intellectual capital indicates future directions given the dynamic environmental changes. This thesis aims to explore how organizations identify, evaluate, and report intellectual capital. It reviews relevant intellectual capital scholarship and prior studies on its management within organizations. The empirical research focuses on understanding the concept of intellectual capital within Serbian organizations and its importance for financial reporting. The study confirms the thesis hypothesis that effectively presenting intellectual capital is a leading performance indicator in the modern era, with the goal of providing comprehensive information. The final conclusion highlights the need for intellectual capital valuation and its inclusion in supplementary financial statements to accurately depict organizational value. The existing suite of financial statements and quantitative indicators lack the precision needed for presenting necessary information. Quantifying nonfinancial elements or describing them can provide a sharper image of an organization's value and potential.
