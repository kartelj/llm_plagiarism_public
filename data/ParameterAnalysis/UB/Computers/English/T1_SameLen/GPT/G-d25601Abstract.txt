Existing patterns in computer architecture focus on enhancing computer systems' performance to the maximum extent for addressing massive data processing demands. The design of a processor, being the principal actor in data processing, is the focal point. The anticipated improvement in processor performance stated by Moore's Law has been decelerating due to physical thresholds of semiconductor technology, making further enhancement tougher. This issue is being mitigated through a range of methods intended to bolster performance without escalating transistor and power usage. In this dissertation, asymmetrical multicore processors equipped for transactional memory are examined. Two innovative approaches are proposed to boost the performance of such processors. One method aims to mitigate transaction gridlock due to high parallelism by moving transactions to a swifter core. The transactions contributing greatest to gridlock occurrence are chosen for migration. Performing them on a quicker core lessens their risk of conflict with other transactions, thereby increasing congestion avoidance possibilities. Another method modifies the cache subsystem to curtail cache access latency, lower the risk of false conflicts, and decrease the number of transistors needed for cache implementation. This could be achieved by deploying small and simple caches. Detailed proposals are provided for both methods' implementation. These methods' prototypes were built in the Gem5 simulator, which depicts the processor system precisely. Using prototypes, the proposed methods were assessed by simulating numerous applications from a standard benchmark group for transactional memory. The simulation results' analysis offered insights on when and how the proposed methods should be implemented.
