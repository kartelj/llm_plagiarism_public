This doctoral thesis primarily explores the creation of a new methodological framework and practical application of an in-house credit-rating model for medium and large Serbian companies. The chief aim is to quantify credit risk for Serbian companies through the application of a novel credit scoring model and assess firm credit quality utilising the internally developed credit rating model. The data used for this research consists of seven years worth of financial statements, in the form of balance sheets and income statements, from companies in Serbia spanning the years 2006 to 2012. By using this data, the default probability of Serbian businesses is quantified, taking into account the unique characteristics of the market and business environment. This doctorate involves three significant areas based on the new and original methodology established by the author. The first area focusses on analysing financial ratios and determining the most predictive financial ratio in Serbia based on available data history. The transformation of financial ratio data was then employed with the intent of developing a credit scoring model. Consequently, a new credit-scoring model was developed and proposed to determine default probability, exhibiting more predictive power than models like the Altman Z-score model, which has been developed and used in foreign markets. Ultimately, the in-house credit rating model was proposed and established using an original approach to organising and employing results from the previously developed credit scoring model. The final models and its results underwent a validation process as proposed by relevant academic literature and the new Basel Capital Accord standards. Credit risk weights were determined based on Basel II and III principles. It was shown that all results from this research supported the initial hypothesis of the thesis.
