Wireless mesh networks (WMNs) have emerged as an innovative trend in wireless communications, offering more flexibility, reliability, and superior network performances compared to conventional wireless local area networks. Considering the rising need for speedy and efficient data transfer along with multimedia transmission (voice and video), the primary challenges in constructing WMNs are enhancing throughput (by implementing the multi-channel multi-interfaces (MCMI) method into WMN), and considering the quality of service (QoS). To extract maximum network performances, it's crucial to establish protocols and routing metrics that prescribe the best path between the origin and the destination node. Given that the WMN exhibits high signal dynamics, particularly in complex situations (regarding radio coverage), such as indoor settings, this dissertation proposes routing metrics capable of quickly adapting to propagation conditions changes at each network link. The link costs of the three novel metrics, powerETX (Expected Transmission Count), powerWCETT (Weighted Cumulative Expected Transmission Time), and powerMIC (Metric of Interference and Channel-switching), in addition to parameters encapsulated in the current ETX, WCETT, and MIC metrics, respectively, encompass a parameter contingent on the received signal level. Comparatively, these new metrics offer higher data throughput and reduced average end-to-end delay than existing metrics, and they can be implemented with no additional hardware and minimal software modifications. Keeping in consideration that the existing channel assignment (CA) algorithms do not provide QoS support in MCMI-WMNs and multimedia transmission might face unacceptable delays, this dissertation proposes a new protocol for link layer QoS-HMCP (QoS Hybrid Multi-Channel Protocol). This protocol introduces QoS support through EDCA (Enhanced Distributed Channel Access) mechanism, and utilizes the beneficial attributes of the hybrid CA algorithm specified by the HMCP protocol for link layer. Four variants of the QoS-HMCP protocols, which consider different channel switching criteria and medium competition procedures, are proposed, and are contrasted with the basic HMCP protocol in terms of user data throughput and network delay. The results validate the incorporation of QoS support into the MCMI network. Ultimately, after juxtaposing the proposed variants, conclusions are drawn on which version of the QoS-HMCP protocol delivers the best results (the highest throughput with the least delay), and suitable traffic categories and network conditions. Moreover, this dissertation contributes further by providing a thorough and organized review of existing routing protocols, channel assignment tactics, and the routing metrics for multi-channel multi-interface WMNs.
