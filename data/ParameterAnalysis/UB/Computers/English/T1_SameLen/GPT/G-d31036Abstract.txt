This doctoral dissertation focuses on a classification model, aiming to develop one that utilizes case-based reasoning (CBR) and intelligent similarity measures selection, thus enhancing the accuracy of classifying new cases. It explores the potential of optimizing domain knowledge, expressed via preference functions, to elevate the predictive efficacy of a CBR system. Moreover, it questions if a model employing specific similarity measures for categorical data combined with preference functions for numerical data similarity measurement, can outdo the conventional k-NN CBR model. Similarity measurement among cases is crucial in any CBR model. Commonly, CBR models use Euclidean metric for numerical variables similarity measurement and overlap function for categorical attributes. Preference theory functions can potentially be used for case similarity measurement, offering more ways to reflect decision-makers' preferences. This dissertation will present the outcomes of classification models utilizing specific categorical attribute similarity measures and numerical attribute preference functions. It includes attribute weights optimization and reveals models' predictive strength based on the consideration of nearest neighbors. The parameters of each preference function and the attribute weights are established via a genetic algorithm. The model's performance is evaluated on three distinct benchmark datasets of clients requesting credit application consideration. Model accuracy is determined through a 10-fold cross-validation test. Cross-validation folds are generated using a seed to randomize the data. The experimental findings confirmed that all models using preference theory functions surpassed the traditional k-NN classifier, irrespective of the applied categorical attribute similarity measures. Conversely, models employing preference theory functions and varying categorical data similarity measures revealed that every specific dataset had an optimal method, using not only preference theory functions but also a suitable categorical attributes similarity measure.
