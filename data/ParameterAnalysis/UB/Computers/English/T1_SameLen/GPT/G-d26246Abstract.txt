The use of biometric technologies in modern society is becoming increasingly prevalent, almost to a point where we could assert that these technologies are a regular part of our daily lives. The introduction of biometric authentication comes with particular needs and limitations depending on the specific situation in which the system operates. To select the appropriate biometric mode, alongside a suitable algorithm for that mode, it's necessary to conduct a performance evaluation of the biometric system, though this assessment isn't always simple. This applies both to unimodal and multimodal biometric systems. Even with available open biometrics databases for evaluation, adjustments must be made for the system to work with the selected database's testing protocol. If the biometric system encompasses various biometric modes, the evaluation process becomes all the more complex because of the variety of fusion algorithms available. In response to these challenges, and in the absence of a comprehensive model of multimodal biometric systems in pertinent literature, this thesis proposes an all-encompassing evaluation model for multimodal biometric systems. The model is founded on the MDA (Model Driven Architecture) paradigm. An integral part of this evaluation model includes the metamodel of multimodal biometric system evaluation, which acts as an ontology for terms in this field. Based on this model, a prototype framework has been constructed to evaluate multimodal biometrics systems. Through the implementation of the proposed framework, the performance of multimodal biometric systems can be evaluated under varying conditions. Experimental analysis results, derived from database use and algorithm implementation, indicate that the framework reduces the time needed for evaluation to a quarter of the previously necessary timeframe. Also, a novel analytical method for optimizing the biometric system threshold was developed, this method is predicated on a predefined model of the desired system behavior. Ultimately, an educational tool was designed using some of the framework's functions, illustrating how the framework can streamline the process of training engineers in the realm of biometrics.
