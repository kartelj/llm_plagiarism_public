Content added by users on online forums far outweighs the frequency of its deletion or modification, thus posing a unique challenge to incremental crawling in contrast to web page crawling. Shifting content on forums often results in these existing comments or posts being moved to other current or new pages. Carrying out incremental crawling in these forums is not straightforward, as overlooking the method of content organization, distribution, and arrangement could lead to previously indexed posts being re-transferred. Moreover, the wide variety of forum technologies available often come with their own distinct navigation paths to the most recent posts, and different approaches to organizing and presenting user-created content.

This piece introduces a specialized Structure-driven Incremental Forum crawler (SInFo) that focuses on locating the latest content during incremental forum crawling through the use of sophisticated optimization techniques and machine learning. The primary objective of this system is to bypass content that has already been indexed in newer crawl cycles, regardless of the technological platform. For this purpose, two web forum features were employed: (1) the sorting method applied on index and thread pages, and (2) the available navigational routes among pages provided by the current web forum technology. Since content creation dates are crucial in determining content sorting, identifying and normalizing these dates is a complex task. Machine learning models were employed due to the potential variability in date formats and languages. Furthermore, detecting navigation paths was achieved by interpreting URLs and scanning the targeted pages.

It has been demonstrated that the proposed methods and techniques can result in less duplicated content downloads, and make more efficient use of the current forum's navigational structure and pathways when seeking pages with the latest content. These experiments were conducted with a variety of popular, current forum technologies as well as independent, standalone platforms. The SInFo model has demonstrated high precision and the least number of duplicate content transfers during each new crawl cycle. Most duplicates encountered by the system were located on pages that needed to be accessed to accurately identify the navigation path or find the correct URL. Lastly, while machine learning models may be complex, they offer effective performance during crawling, and high precision in the detection and normalization of dates, achieving a 99% F1-score.
