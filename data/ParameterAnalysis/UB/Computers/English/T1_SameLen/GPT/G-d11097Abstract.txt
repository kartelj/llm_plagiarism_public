The principle of market positioning is based on active involvement in shaping tourism offers or services, enabling tourism businesses to secure the best market position. The first method of positioning, dating back to the 1970s, involved individual company promotions with marketing professionals primarily concerned with securing a unique place in the consumer's mind through marketing endeavors. Despite many scholars subsequently providing multiple viewpoints and definitions on positioning, universally applicable market coordinates that ensure an optimal, consistent and sustainable market position have yet to be devised. In alignment with the evolution of the positioning concept, the methods used to achieve positioning objectives have transformed from multidimensional scaling to discriminant, factor, and Conjoint analysis. This thesis suggests a novel method for addressing market positioning issues that leverages both statistical and operational research models, allowing marketing managers to quickly respond and devise market positioning strategies within a competitive landscape. This proposed model allows for anticipating potential competitor moves, balancing consumer preference and competitive focus, thereby leading to a more effective optimal market strategy formulation. Conjoint analysis is used to evaluate consumer preferences, assisting in understanding market heterogeneity and determining optimal tourism product features. If divergent preferences exist, the cluster analysis can be utilized for tourism market segmentation. Considering that modern markets are virtually inconceivable without competition, incorporating all potential market interactions is essential. Such market conflicts, seemingly chaotic, contain rationalities modeled via game theory principles. The joint use of these three models (Conjoint Analysis, Cluster Analysis, and Game Theory) provides an enhanced approach for optimizing market position compared to previous approaches, which primarily used these models separately. The application and validity of this unique market positioning model are proven through its real-world testing on gastronomy events. The significance of this proposed model lies in its adaptability, flexibility, and capacity for dynamic decision-making. Due to market changes, which may include launching new products, improving existing products, or shifts in consumer preferences, it can be reapplied to maintain the optimal market position. This model may have wide-ranging applicability in the future, across all tourism sectors, and the service sector, where it can serve as a universal paradigm for determining the optimal market position.
