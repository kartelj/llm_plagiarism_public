Parallel knowledge assessments are examinations featuring different item subsets (question clusters or varying task types) with nearly identical measurement attributes, enabling interchangeability. They work well when multiple test-takers are engaged, irrespective of simultaneous or separate participation. Testing outcomes need to be comparable. Automating parallel test assembly is virtually essential to ensure objectivity in testing, by adequately balancing the measurement traits of different test forms and minimizing scope for subjective examiner errors. Also, large-scale testing sees significant time savings for the examiner in terms of preparing parallel tests through automated assembly. Since the automated parallel test assembly challenge (APTA) falls under NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems, applying heuristics is both anticipated and necessary. The APTA problem closely resembles existing combinatorial optimization problems, therefore, heuristics employed to solve those could also be useful for addressing the APTA problem. This dissertation provides a comprehensive review of existing problem formulations, their mathematical models, and an overview of the heuristics used for tackling different problem formulations. Initially, problem formulations and heuristic solutions are categorized separately, then cross-categorized to reveal uncharted territories open to explore through new combinations of problem formulations and solution heuristics. The heuristics typically applied to tackle APTA problems are mainly improvement heuristics, where execution is halted at the occurrence of a set execution time or upon achieving the desired solution quality. Constructive heuristics are primarily used to generate an initial solution for enhancement by heuristics. This dissertation is centered on proposing a new efficient polynomially complex method for completely addressing the APTA challenge. The recommended method tackles one version of the bin packing problem by adapting the constructive heuristic proposed by Nawaz, Enschore and Ham, which hasn't been utilized to handle the APTA problem before. The methodâ€™s most striking features include predictable execution timing, efficiency and easy implementation. Efficient and predictable testing and assembly are particularly important for institutions with recurrent testing of a relatively small candidate pool and limited available resources for APTA. The proposed APTA method has been implemented and compared to performance comparable methods based on improvement heuristics such as simulated annealing (SA) and variable neighborhood search (VNS). In published literature, the VNS method provides the best quality results for the bin packing problem-formulated APTA problem. The proposed algorithm significantly reduces execution time compared to the SA algorithm, while maintaining almost equal quality. In contrast to the VNS algorithm, average execution time is drastically reduced, and for the same execution time (achieved by halting the VNS algorithm), the newly proposed algorithm attains a higher quality result for relatively smaller cases with few parallel tests (20, 30 and 60) and limited item banks (300 items), commonly seen in knowledge tests in academic institutions.
