This doctoral dissertation focuses on exploring the potential of virtual worlds for research and educational purposes. It examines two main aspects. The first part looks at the notion of independent agents and agent theory more broadly, within the context of virtual worlds. The second component investigates the educational uses of virtual worlds, with particular emphasis on virtual laboratories. The paper begins with an explanation of key terminology related to the topic. Subsequently, a comprehensive overview of the role of agents in virtual worlds is provided, covering, among other things, techniques for shaping agent behavior. The creation of a tailored virtual gamified learning system for agents is subsequently documented in the dissertation, detailed thoroughly. Concluding, the concept of virtual labs in the STE (Science, Technology, and Engineering) fields is analyzed, and current options are assessed based on the criteria defined in the paper.
