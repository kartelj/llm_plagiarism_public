Digital image coding and compression pertain to lowering the memory resources required for the presentation, storage, and transfer of a digital image. Compression methods result in considerable savings. Priority is given to quick algorithms and architectures for compression and decompression, especially in applications necessitating real-time performance. Current high compression ratio techniques for digital image compression are slow, necessitate complex processors and large quantities of high bandwidth memory, while also upping power usage. Both memory capacity and processing time expand as the compression ratio does. In this doctoral thesis, we examined how to hardware realize a codec that minimizes essential memory resources, operates quickly, and possesses a high compression ratio. This task was completed using combined scientific approaches. Required memory resources are minimized using optimized nonstationary filters and a novel two-dimensional subband transformation algorithm, along with a singular pass implementation of probability estimators. Operation speed is achieved through a one pass algorithm for probability estimation and the fact that the input image isnâ€™t part processed. The high compression ratio comes from the collective effects of all realization subsystems: subband transformer, quantizer, one pass probabilities estimator, and entropy coder. The hardware realization from this thesis has been confirmed using an image compression system with a network interface. It has been proven possible to implement a complete color image encoder within an affordable programmable logic device, without any external memory components.
