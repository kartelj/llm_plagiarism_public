'This paper recommends merging two unique fields of study – information systems and operational research – applying multiple soft computing and optimization methods within the service-oriented approach to contemporary software development. Service-orientation is a novel generation approach to establishing distributed applications and business procedure automation, which augments business productivity, efficiency, and agility, thus becoming widely prevalent. This is predicated on the idea that distributing applications can be dynamically and flexibly put together by incorporating autonomously-developed software components – services, which can be constructed on diverse platforms and various programming languages. Using principles of the service-oriented paradigm leads to creating services that function independently of distinct business procedures and can be utilized in multiple applications in diverse ways. Online services are autonomous software components, accessible over the internet, delivering certain functionality. As they are founded on an array of extensively embraced standards, they are the primary method for executing modern service-oriented software solutions. With the spread of online services that provide similar functions - due to being independently established and published online - the dilemma of choosing the most superior one amongst a broad assortment of appropriate services is increasingly crucial. Non-functional properties of services (Quality of Service – QoS) thus become a crucial aspect of the procedure. Moreover, the choice is typically based on several non-functional traits that are very heterogenous. On the contrary, when the wanted functionality cannot be delivered by a singular service but could be accomplished by executing a collection of services, each delivering part of the needed functionality, the task becomes more complicated. A service composition signifies a conglomerate of services working together to automate a particular task or business procedure. The prime advantage of using this method to application development is that existing services can be used to meet new business demands or automate new business procedures with less effort and in a more cost-effective way. The problem of online service selection for a composition involves choosing actual services for each part of the set composition, resulting in composition that satisfies desired functional demands but is also optimal in relation to relevant QoS requirements. Furthermore, when selecting services for a composition, the basis for the selection should be the composite service's overall performance. The primary challenge arising when calculating the total QoS for an online service composition is aggregating QoS values in a certain way and the aggregation relies on the selected QoS attributes and the actual composition structure. In addition, certain constraints regarding required QoS levels of the composition are often provided. A thorough review of current modeling problem approaches is given and many approach issues are discussed. Particularly, most existing approaches only allow service selection based on quantitative QoS attributes, necessitate linear functions for QoS value aggregation when determining the composition's QoS and assume the assignment of arbitrary weights and QoS value normalization. To surmount these challenges, two novel models are suggested that do not necessitate the assignment of arbitrary preferences or the normalization of QoS values. Also, the goal is to enable users to more adequately describe the trade-offs they might be ready to make which are usually only formulated as intricate verbal statements. Hence the use of Boolean consistent fuzzy logic is first proposed since it enables expressing complex verbal statements as logical demands which are defined in the Boolean frame. Furthermore, logical aggregation results in a new structure of components as opposed to the weighted sum method. Using Boolean consistent fuzzy logic instead of conventional fuzzy logic is preferred since the latter does not account for statements which include negation, therefore not complying with the axioms of excluded middle and contradiction. A second innovative approach is proposed for situations when no logical demands exist regarding the relevant criteria but the criteria are diverse and communicated using multiple measurement units. In these cases, the problem can be modeled as a discrete multi-objective fractional programming problem (MOFP). The initial criteria are paired taking into account their nature (unit measure and type) so that all fractional objectives have the same unit and can be optimized in the same direction. For service selection for a particular functionality, a ground-breaking method combining the Analytical Hierarchy Process method (AHP) with Boolean consistent fuzzy logic is proposed to allow service selection based on logical demands regarding QoS criteria. Since certain criteria might influence or be influenced by other criteria and the importance of the criteria might alter based on the demonstrated level of other criteria, on one hand, and on the other, traditional AHP method lacks support for such problems, it is suggested that logical functions could account for these relationships. The examples demonstrate that the conventional and consistent fuzzy methods can lead to the choice of different alternatives. Several methods are proposed for service selection for a composition. First, an adaptation of an existing exact method for solving the posed MOFP problem is presented. For larger, time-critical problems like the dynamic selection of services, the usage of heuristic methods is recommended. To facilitate this, the well-known Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS) metaheuristic is applied for service selection for the first time. Then a burgeoning metaheuristic founded on tabu search and VNS is presented. It is shown that both methods can be used to solve both the MMKP model (as one of the most common literature approaches) and the suggested model based on consistent fuzzy logic. In addition, a novel method for generating an initial feasible solution for the MMKP problem is proposed. The validation of the proposed methods is supported by a specially developed software solution. Finally, the potential for the broader application of these proposed methods is discussed.'
