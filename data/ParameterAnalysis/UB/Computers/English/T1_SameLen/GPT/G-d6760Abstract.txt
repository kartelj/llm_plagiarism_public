'This thesis explores the utilization of contemporary software engineering techniques in open source software construction within intelligent systems. The primary outcomes include a generalized software framework model and guidelines for overseeing open source initiatives in this domain. The developed framework model and project-management suggestions were tested and approved during the enhancement of a chosen software framework for neural networks. The chosen neural network framework ranks amongst the top Java open source neural network structures. The recommended techniques for software development are also applicable in other sectors of intelligent systems and represent solutions to issues and special demands in this area. The majority of these issues stem from the necessity for research-oriented software that is simultaneously practical and complex but still easy to use and alter. The suggested development techniques are associated with requirement specifications, planning, designing, implementation, and upkeep. These are presented as advice that has been established as effective practice. Alongside these theoretical and methodological inputs, this thesis also offers practical input in the shape of new features for a selected framework in intelligent systems, significantly improving its practical use.
