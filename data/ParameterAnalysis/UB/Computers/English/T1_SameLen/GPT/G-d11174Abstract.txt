As one of the main management tools, managerial control is integral to business enhancement, implementation of corporate strategies and effective operation of a company. The usefulness of the control significantly hinges on the information supplied to decision-makers – details on past success and future forecasts of an organization's standing and income. The examination and prediction of past and future success are areas covered within business performance measurement systems. Thus, introducing a new or incorporating an existing business performance measurement system is a crucial foundation for successful decision-making. To meet the information requirements of management, managerial accountants and specialists from a host of other managerial fields have endeavored to formulate principles, theories, techniques and processes for the construction of business performance measurement systems. Besides the theoretical and functional issues, contemporary studies also deal with the difficulties associated with the development of specific business performance measurement systems. Despite over a decade of focus on these matters, the creation and implementation of business performance measurement systems remains in its early stages. Therefore, both academia and management practice view them as a trending topic, sparking lively discussion over the ideal business performance measurement system. The objective of this doctoral thesis is to design a novel business performance measurement system. The specific goal is to identify the factors influencing the system's construction – the number of performance measures intended to be incorporated into the system and the proposed use of the system. The main theory defining the scope of this dissertation is the contingency theory in management accounting. The research identified a group of factors that influence the diverseness and application of the performance measurement system. Following, the impacts of the performance measurement systems on organizational (financial and nonfinancial) success were evaluated. The first-hand data from the empirical research were utilized to validate the theoretical model. As far as the author's knowledge extends, no similar study has been carried out in Serbia. Outside of Serbia, only a limited examination of a contingency factor's impact on the business performance systems took place, but never in a comprehensive manner presented in this doctoral thesis. The findings suggest that Serbian companies utilize a fairly extensive range of performance measures. The factors delineated in the theoretical model impact both the diverseness and use of performance measurement systems. However, their significance greatly varies. Additionally, the balanced application of financial and nonfinancial performance indicators drastically impacts business success. These findings could be helpful to other researchers in the fields of performance measurement, management control, and management accounting. Furthermore, these findings are beneficial to practitioners – consultants and managers – in devising performance measurement systems in specific companies.
