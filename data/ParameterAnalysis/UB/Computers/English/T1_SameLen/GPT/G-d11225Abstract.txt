This thesis introduces a new method for visualizing cryptographic algorithms (CryptOgraphic Algorithms visuaL simulAtion â€“ COALA). The system's primary purpose is to help beginners in data security comprehend cryptographic algorithms more efficiently, forming the groundwork for more advanced topics. At the School of Electrical Engineering, University of Belgrade, the Data Security course covers cryptographic algorithms, security protocols and applications, and system security. Exam results reveal students struggle to understand cryptographic algorithm material, causing a negative effect on their overall exam score. The introduction of a visual system for cryptographic algorithms in lab exercises could rectify this issue after analyzing the problem causes. Such systems are commonly used in software-related computer engineering and information systems courses. Before developing a new system, existing solutions were analyzed to identify an already existing system that meets the Data Security course requirements and to outline characteristics a successful educational aid system should have. Despite an abundance of algorithm visual representations (AV systems), very few can visualize cryptographic algorithms, and none fully meet the Data Security course spesific needs. A development methodology for such a system is proposed based on a categorization of existing algorithm visual representation systems with a focus on cryptographic algorithm systems. By analyzing literature on eLearning tools, an efficient use strategy for the system in the education process is established. The system allows comprehensive analysis of all cryptographic algorithms discussed in lectures and problem-solving lessons. It displays the execution of supported algorithms in detail, notable for understanding the system operates with real-world algorithm parameter lengths, and all input parameters in the algorithms are adjustable to demonstrate the execution of algorithms on varying examples quickly and easily. Numerous reviews concerning the eLearning tools field, systems for visual representation of algorithms (AV systems), and cryptographic algorithm visual representation systems were included in the thesis. Descriptions of cryptographic algorithms supported by the COALA system are exhibited. The system supports five types of cryptographic algorithms: substitution algorithms (Caesar, mono-alphabetic, Playfair, and Vigenere algorithms), transposition algorithms (Rail Fence and Row Transposition algorithms), production algorithms (Rotor Machine), symmetric block algorithms (DES and AES), and public-key algorithms (Diffie-Hellman and RSA). Attention is drawn to the visual representation explanation in the COALA system. The functional description and software implementation details of the COALA system are presented in the dissertation.
