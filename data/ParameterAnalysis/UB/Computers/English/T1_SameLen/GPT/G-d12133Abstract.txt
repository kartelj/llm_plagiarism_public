Estimating the effort needed to develop a software system is one of the most challenging yet crucial tasks in software engineering. In many cases, the decision to proceed with a project, the constraints under which it operates, and its success are often dictated by the effort estimates. Unfortunately, these predictions are typically made with incomplete requirements, relying on various heuristics, assumptions, and experience, even when the best guesses are needed quickly. Despite significant advancements in software engineering, effort estimation methods mainly rely on the subjective evaluations of project teams or experts. As a result, the errors in effort estimates are frequently larger than anticipated. Global data reveals that only one-third of software projects are successfully completed, another third exceeds budget and time constraints, while the remainder fail, often due to inaccurate effort estimations. This thesis aims to review existing effort estimation methods and suggest new methods to improve accuracy. The thesis will introduce new models and techniques to enhance current estimation methods. It will also propose improvements to existing assessment methods and provide tangible results that can be achieved by applying these changes to actual software projects. These improvements will focus on identifying project parameters that most significantly affect effort and discovering the relationships between these parameters and the effort.
