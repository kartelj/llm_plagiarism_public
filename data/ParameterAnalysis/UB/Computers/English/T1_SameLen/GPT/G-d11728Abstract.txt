This dissertation's initial section explores an analysis of routing protocols in the construct of data center topologies, focusing on the two-phase routing methodologies that facilitate the avoidance of congestion in consistent and abundant alternate path-carrying data center topologies. A new two-phase routing mechanism, known as LB-ECR, is suggested that heightens the productivity of data center networks. Through linear programming techniques, LB-ECR enhances the absence-of-loss throughput in association with the specified traffic demand of the switches. LB-ECR relies on the Equal Cost Multiple Path (ECMP) routing strategy frequently utilized in data centers due to its ability to employ alternate equal-cost paths. Two-phase balance contributes to the simplicity of the linear model by excluding traffic flows, as well as mitigating congestion risks by distributing network traffic across lesser-used connections. Simplifying the linear model thus eases its interpretation for extensive data centers. This first section of the dissertation offers insights into network topologies and routing within data centers, as well as performance comparisons of differing routing schemes across typical data center topologies.

Beyond routing optimization, this dissertation scrutinizes the algorithms used for amending the lookup tables of Internet routers. The second segment of this dissertation elucidates the lookup and update algorithms. The updating effectiveness of two superior lookup algorithms is examined. We construct formulas stipulating the peak memory requirements for two fast lookup algorithms, demonstrating the memory needs for typical routing tables via simulations. The dissertation also assesses the number of memory interactions to lookup units during updates, the intricacy of the updating algorithms, and their implementation timeframes for regular routing tables.

The final segment of this dissertation encompasses the implementation details of the two-phase routing algorithms, the lookup update systems, and their incorporation within router components.
