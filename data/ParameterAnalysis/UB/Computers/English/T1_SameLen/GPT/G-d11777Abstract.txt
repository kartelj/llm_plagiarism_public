A data warehouse serves as a foundation for executing business intelligence systems, combining data, and facilitating decision-making. A dimensional model is typically established for the data warehouse to enhance data visualization. The blueprint of a data warehouse outlines the basic components of a data warehouse and delineates the interconnections and arrangement of these components. Two leading approaches are used in data warehouse structures. The first, CIF (Corporate Information Factory) architecture, is endorsed by Bill Inmon who advocates for a data warehouse to be standardized and to encompass atomic data in a third normal form. Ralph Kimball presents the second approach known as BUS architecture, promoting the need for a warehouse to possess a multi-dimensional structure as well. The Data Vault model of data warehouse, developed by Daniel Linstedt, is detail-oriented, historically tracked and distinctly interlinked grouping of standardized tables assisting one or more business functional areas. This hybrid approach incorporates the best aspects of third normal form (3NF) and star scheme. The Data Vault model underscores the necessity of tracing the origin and time of data entry into the database and facilitates easy modifications in the data warehouse structure corresponding to shifts in the business environment. Various methodological approaches are involved in constructing data warehouses. Nevertheless, there are issues due to the non-automatic nature of the process of data warehouse design and its associated dimensional model. This dissertation sought to address the issue of the data warehouse design process, using a thorough literary analysis, and investigated the potential for automation of the physical design of a data warehouse based on the Data Vault model, requiring minimal user interaction. It outlines a straightforward algorithm for the automated physical design of a data warehouse, using the Data Vault model, drawing from data models with meta-data transactional data sources and rules. The algorithm for accessing the physical design of a data warehouse formalizes, generalizes, and significantly automates the physical design process of data warehouses. It uses a physical model of structured, semi-structured, and straightforward non-structured data sources. The relational model is mutually essential for both Data Vault implementation and for core data. Therefore, all types are abstracted with a meta-model. The direct approach signifies that a Physical Data Vault (PDV) is directly created based on the relational physical data source model. Meta-data conceptualization is shown with a physical data model which, with slight alterations, can be applied in designing individual data warehouses, signifying the fundamental methodological contribution of this paper. Furthermore, the paper offers a comprehensive integrated approach to the automation of data warehouse design as it enables the design of data marts as well as associated ETL processes. It integrates all activities needed for the realization of an entire data warehouse. An application prototype for aiding the physical design of data warehouses was developed based on the findings of this dissertation. Testing the algorithm using a prototype of the design automation application on a real healthcare insurance case yielded satisfactory results.
