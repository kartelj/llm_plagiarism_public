Despite massive advancements in AI, the human brain remains superior in understanding and manipulating partially known information. This superiority is particularly evident in the area of question answering. When it comes to providing answers, particularly those not directly available in text corpora, human experts excel due to their ability to explain, synthesize complicated responses, and reason abstractly. Intelligent Question Routing Systems (IQRS) act as knowledge exchange mediums in any field requiring intense user interaction. Benefits of deploying these systems include reducing unnecessary expert consultation and enhancing the quality of service by the system owners such as businesses, governments, and universities since users receive satisfying responses from appropriate sources. This thesis presents an IQRS system design method. It commences with a review of existing research in this realm, focusing on the implementation of the IQRS process's stages. The review also introduces a new presentation paradigm summarizing existing approaches found in available literature. The new paradigm comprises three basic processing stages tied with the three primary challenges of system implementation: question analysis, question forwarding, and user knowledge profiling. Following this analysis, a new methodology to fix identified issues is proposed. The remainder of the thesis describes an IQRS prototype implementing the proposed concepts. The question analysis module employs a technique enabling question visualization, offering a clear depiction of important relationships among concepts within the question. The approach merges completely automated text processing and manual result revision, allowing users to enhance result precision. Concurrently, the article processing module is utilized for answer evaluation. An analysis of various procedures for determining the semantic similarity of two short texts is then presented, emphasizing ones suitable for languages with limited electronic linguistic resources. Based on this conclusion, a new algorithm, LInSTSS, is proposed. Additionally, a Serbian paraphrase corpus is created and used to compare the results with existing solutions. The results indicate better performance for the proposed solution. An evaluation utilizing English and Serbian paraphrase corpora fine-tune the algorithm. Lessons learned from this process are applied to design a module for calculating semantic similarity between a question and user profile. Problems related to comparing questions and user profiles are discussed during the question forwarding phase, and a new algorithm, P2Q, is proposed. An analysis of web portals is undertaken to identify those suited for creating a question-and-answer corpus. The created corpus extracts three different user types to test system performance and generate an initial hypothesis. The results suggest that the P2Q approach performs significantly better than other methods. The semantic information extraction capability notably improved system outputs. The thesis's academic contribution lies in system analysis and synthesis to enable intelligent question routing. Evaluation results suggest that properly weighted assignments can increase system performance. It is concluded that considering users' best answers and questions can form a more comprehensive profile of potentially beneficial users.
