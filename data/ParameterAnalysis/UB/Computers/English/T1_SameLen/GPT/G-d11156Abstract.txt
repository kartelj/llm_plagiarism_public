The aim of this thesis is to illustrate and clarify the potential for enhancing decision-making in the selection of the most economically viable supplier in public e-procurement. This choice is dependent on established parameters that are set by the buyer in public e-procurement. The process is straightforward when there are only a few contenders and when there are established quantitative measures for comparison. Nonetheless, reality and experience bring about scenarios with a plethora of contenders and the choice of the most viable option among them is based on both qualitative and quantitative measures. The principal hypothesis in this thesis, confirmed within the scope of the doctoral research, is that leveraging multi-criteria decision-making methodologies and the fuzzy set theory can enrich the selection of the most economically viable bidder in public e-procurement when both qualitative and quantitative parameters are employed simultaneously. In such a selection process, it is feasible to identify the values tied to the outcome variable that correspond to the weight of the parameters belonging to a fuzzy set through a process known as defuzzification, meaning the choice of a singular outcome variable with identical quantification. Simultaneously, the thesis introduces a decision support system grounded on the principle of multi-criteria decision making and the fuzzy set theory. This system is an essential component of the web portal for public e-procurement, facilitating the creation of a collaborative workspace that seamlessly joins buyers and suppliers into a unified, virtual e-procurement platform.
