Gamma scintillation cameras (GSC) are essential medical tools for studying the distribution of administered, breathed in, or consumed radiopharmaceuticals. Advances in integrated circuit technology have substantially affected the design and flexibility of GSC's head unit and associated systems, enhancing speed, reducing cost, and expanding capabilities. Although the shift to digital GSCs started in the 1980s, many nuclear medicine centers continue to use analog or semi-analog devices that have fully functioning mechanics and scintillation crystals, which form the basis for nuclear imaging. An ideal solution is to digitize the GSC and link it up with advanced computer systems to ensure the continued use of older equipment and delay the need to purchase new ones. This also allows for the application of the most up-to-date nuclear medical study analysis, in accordance with Evidence Based Medicine (EBM) policies, as well as the testing and development of new diagnostic methods, provided that the system's architectural design is open. 

The focus of the research presented in this doctoral thesis is to create a computer system, the GammaKey system that offers functionality (capturing, storage, and image processing) to semi-analog GSCs that is compatible and suitable for use with recent digital systems. It has an open architectural design that enables the creation and clinical application of new diagnostic methods. The GammaKey system meets various requirements, including easy substitution of the original computer system to a new setup, reliability that meets the quality standards of nuclear medical equipment specified by the National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA), compatibility with other medical and non-medical systems through the use of standard data formats, and quick, inexpensive, and easy upgrades to new computer generations and analog-to-digital converters. 

The standard setup of the GammaKey system includes standard image processing functions, tools for image manipulation, and common functions for scintigraphic study processing. It also includes advanced configurations with three non-standard features: EffSpleen acquisition and analysis for predicting the effectiveness of splenectomies in patients suffering from chronic immune thrombocytopenic purpura; submarine analysis for detecting parathyroid tumors; salivary scan analysis for completely quantifying the functionality of salivary glands. 

The GammaKey system has been used in daily clinical practice in two leading medical centers in Serbia which have treated over 30,000 patients using it. The system not only allows for the continuity of basic clinical practice and contemporary trends, but also enables ongoing research, defines validated reference values, and validates other applications. This makes it a system that fully complies with the EBM concept.
