In the Introduction section, we establish our research domain and primary objectives, highlight essential hypotheses and research methodology, and supply a contents and breakdown of the dissertation, stressing vital components of our work. The second section delves into the notion of efficiency and methods for assessing and quantifying efficacy. The efficiency principle is crucial in modern business decision-making (Savić, 2011). Efficiency can be defined as the ability to economize inputs to achieve maximum outcomes (Amado et al., 2011). For organizations that use one input to generate one output, efficiency is measured as output over input. The real problem arises when assessing the efficiency of organizational systems that use a variety of inputs to produce different outputs (Thanassoulis et al., 2012). This research's main objective was to develop a new statistical model of efficiency that could handle different types of input/output variables. As such, it's essential to consolidate all indicators into a single value. The challenge is how to deal with variables measured in different units and how to assign suitable weighting factors. The Data Envelopment Analysis – DEA, a method frequently employed, will be explained. Charnes, Cooper & Rhodes (1978) created the DEA method to measure the efficiency of organizational units, especially non-profit ones. This method suggests a nonparametric approach for efficiency evaluation, combining multiple inputs and outputs into a single virtual input and output. The weighting problem was solved by allowing each Decision-Making Unit (DMU) to set its own weights, the intent of which was to maximize efficiency. The only restriction was that weights had to be positive, and the ratio of virtual outputs to virtual inputs couldn't exceed 1 (Martić, 1999). Alongside the DEA method for measuring efficiency, the Stochastic Frontier Analysis (SFA) was also discussed in the dissertation. This approach offers an alternative way to measure efficiency using extended econometric models. Chapter three switches focus to multivariate data analysis, which refers to many observations collected on a large set of variables. Multivariate data analysis enables us to examine intricate data sets, with numerous dependent and independent variables present. Chapter three is mostly concerned with two essential statistical methods: principal component analysis (PCA) & factor analysis, and cluster analysis. Factor analysis and PCA are most commonly used to identify a relatively small number of factors representing complex interrelations between all variables. These methods are very useful in uncovering the hidden aspects of observed phenomena. The main difference between these methods lies in the way data is analysed. Factor analysis primarily considers covariance, while PCA examines variances. Both have similar objectives and procedures, which makes factor analysis a special case of PCA (Bulajić, 2002). Significant attention is also given to cluster analysis as a method of multivariate data analysis. It is frequently used to group objects so that similar ones form a group distinct from others. Objects are clustered based on similarity, which is defined in many different ways. The dissertation's primary aim was to create a new statistical efficiency model based on the I-distance method. Therefore, the fourth chapter centers on the I-distance metrics in n-dimensional space, proposed and defined by prof. dr Branislav Ivanović (Ivanović 1972, 1973, 1977; Ivanović & Fanchette, 1973). As a leading expert in the Statistical department of United Nations (UN) and its agencies such as UNCTAD and FAO (United Nations Conference on Trade and Development – UNCTAD; Food and Agriculture Agency - FAO), Professor Ivanović created this method to rank countries according to numerous variables. Many socio-economic indicators were considered, and the crucial challenge was how to incorporate all of them into a synthesized indicator representing the rank. The proposed solution was based on creating a hypothetical entity with minimum values for each indicator/variable and measuring other entities' distance in the observed data set from it. The principle argument supporting the use of the I-distance method is its ability to merge a large number of differently measured variables into a single value. The dissertation paid particular attention to applications of the I-distance method, notably its use in ranking the world's best universities according to the Academic Ranking of World Universities – ARWU and SCImago methodologies (Scopus Journal Ranking). The improved I-distance method was highlighted as a significant contribution, as it readily solves the problem of subjective weighting factor assignment for variables/indicators. Besides these applications, the dissertation presented the issue of evaluating socio-economic development of countries, evaluating national health, and ranking sports teams. All these case studies have been verified in leading scientific journals. Chapter five centers on a novel statistical efficiency model based on the I-distance method, named Distance-Based Analysis – DBA in the dissertation and verified through many examples published in leading journals. The DBA method was applied to university scientific output efficiency, banking sector efficiency, health sector efficiency and efficiency of regions in Serbia. The proposed method yielded intriguing results and insights, which were subsequently cross-referenced with the DEA method. The dissertation made significant advancements to the method corpus for measuring efficiency. Likewise, the I-distance method was significantly improved, with algorithm enhancements enabling better initial solution selection and variable inclusion order. As the I-distance method aims to integrate many different types of measurement variables into a single value, it's crucial that the maximum amount of information is encompassed by the I-distance. The dissertation demonstrated that the initial solution, based on the sum of absolute correlations, rapidly converges to the final solution. This improved method gives better results, as the obtained solution comprises the maximum amount of input variables/indicators. The method's enhancement is reflected in the fewer steps required to achieve the final solution. Finally, a conclusion was provided with responses to each research question and hypothesis. Systematization of scientific contributions and potential for further research were also discussed. An extensive bibliography was included, and the appendix contained results of an experiment improving the I-distance method.
