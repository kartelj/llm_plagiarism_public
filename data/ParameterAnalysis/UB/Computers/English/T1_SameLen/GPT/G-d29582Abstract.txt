The swift evolution of technology and machine learning algorithms was propelled by the explosion of data and devices, which are vital for data analysis and processing systems. The performance of these systems hinges solely on data quality, the chosen algorithm, and its parameters, given the massive data volume at hand. Data anomalies, which vary from data distribution and impact data quality, can be identified using machine learning algorithms. The choice of algorithm and parameters for identifying these anomalies relies entirely on the acumen of the system's designer or a domain expert. When sample data with labelled anomalies is absent, which is commonly the case in reality, picking the right algorithm for anomaly detection becomes a nontrivial issue. The task of anomaly detection algorithm selection can be automated through an automated machine learning system (AutoML) that recommends an algorithm for anomaly detection based on data and meta-features. An escalating number of research papers are casting a spotlight on AutoML frameworks, which are emerging as a viable solution to construct complex machine learning models without human expertise and intervention. The primary challenge in empowering AutoML frameworks to develop an efficient model for anomaly detection tasks lies in determining the optimum underlying model for a specific task and optimization metric. Meta-learning approaches utilizing a collection of meta features that outline data properties can facilitate effective model selection in AutoML frameworks. Existing meta-learning methods, which rely on statistical and information-theoretic meta features, call for substantial amounts of data and computational resources to extract data properties. This doctoral dissertation focuses on the development of a flexible system for extracting meta features grounded in domain-specific knowledge. To assess the suggested meta-features set, the objective is to juxtapose existing solutions with the proposed one through various complexity facets. Additionally, the aim is to design experiments and gather results for future research in the broader field of automated machine learning. The evaluation of experimental results demonstrates that the suggested meta features achieve an accuracy of 87% and satisfy the essential requisites for use in AutoML systems, while existing solutions deliver an accuracy of 73%. In situations where there are insufficient datasets available for evaluation, the proposed solution's performance is 25% inferior to that of existing solutions. This research's significance lies in the potential to implement AutoML systems utilizing the proposed meta-features set. In instances where there are no sample data with labelled anomalies, or data is absent, the data creator or domain expert will be able to efficiently characterize the anomalies in the data based on domain-specific knowledge.
