Ongoing education and regular training is a fundamental aspect of the progress in today's society, driven by technological evolution and global commerce. Rapid advancements in technology and information sciences have revolutionized education, giving birth to new areas of study and understanding. One such field that emerged in the 21st century is business intelligence, which aims at understanding educational data and, in return, enhancing the learning process. The focus of the PhD thesis in question is the application of business intelligence in education, specifically aimed at understanding key determinants of student success to enhance the process of higher education. The thesis sets out to ascertain crucial factors affecting a student's academic journey, right from the origin and high school to the undergraduate level, with the help of business intelligence. The thesis takes an in-depth look at existing studies on data mining in education, especially focusing on higher education. It proposes a new approach and methods to predict performance indicators for higher education institutions. It also suggests an original software solution for analyzing, monitoring, and forecasting student success. This software solution forms a part of an integrated portal aimed at effective knowledge and information exchange between students and faculty. Implementation of developed predictive models was made possible through the usage of business intelligence methods. The result verification was done using the student database of the Faculty of Organizational Sciences, University of Belgrade. The PhD dissertation comprises twelve sections. The introductory chapter outlines the objectives, hypotheses, and plan for the research and the dissertation itself. The next two chapters present basic concepts of business intelligence and data mining. The fourth chapter outlines a research model, mainly in terms of software support and data sources and structures. The fifth chapter employs descriptive and comparative analysis to define data structures and correlations. Chapters six through eight introduce predictive model development using software like RapidMiner, Clementine, and Matlab. The ninth chapter examines prediction model performance. The tenth chapter focuses on the information system for analyzing and monitoring higher education performance. The penultimate chapter provides a summary and conclusions, while the final chapter offers a literature review. The dissertation also contains two appendices presenting further details. The ultimate goal of the thesis is to aid educators in early identification of students needing additional guidance, as well as those capable of pursuing advanced education. The model can also guide students and potential employers about academic and professional capabilities. The study recommends 14 models that provide 90% accuracy in predicting study grade averages, study duration, or professional course assessments during the fourth year of study. Lastly, the results can be adapted for other higher education systems with minor modifications, with the intention of enhancing the overall academic education process. A system is established for observing student success throughout undergraduate studies, which can guide higher education institutions in their decision-making process, facilitate curriculum development, and introduce students to systems and models for predicting their success in higher education.
