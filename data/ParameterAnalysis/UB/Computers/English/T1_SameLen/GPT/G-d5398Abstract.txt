This dissertation presents a model for interoperable e-business statistical systems, based on service-oriented architecture and web services. The study is tailored to be applicable for the statistical system of the Republic of Serbia. Official statistics are vital to the information system of every democratic society, providing data on economic, demographic, social status and environmental condition. The primary role of official statistics is to accurately depict social and economic changes within a nation. Moreover, it spearheads providing a solid basis for analysis and decision-making at various levels, from government and institutional sources to businesses and individuals. Serbia's official statistics follow the principles set out in the UN Economic-Social Council's fundamental principles of official statistics, and the European Commission's Practical codex of European statistics. Most countries own one or more National Statistical Institutions (NSIs) making up that country's national statistical system. Key responsibilities of these systems involve: data collection, storage, and analysis, in addition to data provision to diverse user groups. Within each NSI, different statistical areas utilise specific production lines and processes for statistical production. Generally, NSIs' business structures are founded on the so-called stove-pipe model. Each statistical area within an NSI operates its unique production line independently. Each domain executes the whole production process, from research planning to collecting and analyzing data for publication, independently from others. Each domain has its unique data, sources, and users. The electronic sharing of statistical data is a prevalent communication method among statistical services, though it is constantly faced with interoperability difficulties and data conversion needs. This dissertation suggests adopting universal standards for statistical data sharing and exchange. The primary aim is to develop a set of widely accepted standards, thereby enabling swift and timely data and metadata access. The service-oriented architecture of the statistical information system allows for interoperability at application and business process levels. Semantic level interoperability is accomplished by designing a common domain ontology and developing a common data model based on domain ontology.
