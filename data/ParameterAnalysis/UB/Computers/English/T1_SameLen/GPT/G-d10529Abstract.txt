Understanding is fundamental to human resource development. Utilizing modern knowledge is essential for both individuals and companies to thrive and maintain market competitiveness. Knowledge can be gained through education, via both formal and informal learning settings in schools, colleges, and later in businesses, online and offline. Currently, focus is being drawn in science to online learning (e-learning) and digital education (e-education) through modern information-communication technologies. This doctorate examines informal e-learning through Web 2.0 tools and the advantages of incorporating them into formal educational formats. While the structures and methods of e-learning are broadly understood, they have yet to be adequately incorporated, especially in our regions. This research investigates the effects of the integration of informal e-learning through Web 2.0 tools (e-learning 2.0) in stimulating the potential of human resources. The concept of a personal learning surrounding as a means to format informal e-learning 2.0 is utilised. In this light, the switch from traditional pedagogy to pedagogy 2.0 is reviewed. This change is marked through a shift from a teacher-controlled learning situation to a social, collaborative and participatory technique in activity planning and student involvement, and towards a learner-oriented method and pedagogy 2.0. To confirm pre-determined assumptions, a pedagogical model for designing a private learning environment for e-learning 2.0 is formed and implemented via an action research study. A survey is administered to assess understanding of Web 2.0 tools and to explore how students employ these tools for learning. Participants include students from the Faculty of Organizational Sciences from all years and fields of study. It is discovered that the use of e-learning 2.0 in colleges relies heavily on the studentsâ€™ individual traits and potentials and fields of study, as well as the course organization of the teachers. Senior-year students studying information systems and technologies are identified as an apt group to test the contrived model. To assess the viability of personal learning environments (PLE) in formal education as a method to structure informal e-learning 2.0, an action research study is carried out on the E-Learning course at the Faculty of Organizational Sciences. A pedagogical PLE model for e-learning 2.0 is devised as a result. The pedagogical PLE model for e-learning 2.0 presents a novel model for crafting a personal learning environment for e-learning 2.0 - a model for organizing informal e-learning 2.0. Additionally, as part of the model, an activity algorithm is created as a blueprint for implementing the model through teaching. It is demonstrated that the pedagogical PLE model for e-learning 2.0 can be applied to formal education. Most students reacted positively to this style of learning, finding it innovative and engaging. In summary, it is possible to enhance the formal educational process by utilizing a pedagogical PLE model for e-learning 2.0 derived from an informal learning philosophy. To a certain degree, human resources, or future employees, development potential could be influenced by enhancing abilities required to function in a 2.0 environment, better preparing them for the modern future workplace.
