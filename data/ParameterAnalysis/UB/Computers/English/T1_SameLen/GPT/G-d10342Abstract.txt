Economies rooted in knowledge greatly rely on the adoption and use of knowledge to enhance their competitiveness. In such settings, a large volume of pertinent knowledge is situated within and beyond organizations. The constantly changing global market compels organizations to employ their knowledge flows for their interests, aiming to secure a competitive edge. Organizations aspire to ongoing accumulation of knowledge, thereby enhancing their business solutions and offerings, identifying new market opportunities, fortifying their knowledge foundation, and forecasting market trends. This amplifies the significance of the concept of absorptive capacity which pertains to the procurement, assimilation, alteration, and application of knowledge by an organization. Despite numerous studies concerning the partition of absorptive capacity into components and the analysis of their attributes, this study investigates the relationships among absorptive capacity facets and elements, and also their impact intensity on the absorptive capacity level of organizations involved in technology and knowledge-intensive industries. For this reason, an absorptive capacity management model observing knowledge flow from procurement to application has been developed and implemented. This model hinges upon the partition of absorptive capacity into facets and elements. To determine the potential to assess the effect of absorptive capacity on an organization's competitive potency, which is this doctoral dissertation's primary hypothesis, the outcomes of the absorptive capacity evaluation model application were scrutinized. Quantitative and qualitative methodologies based on a survey were utilized for the study. The collected data were examined using the absorptive capacity evaluation model, and discriminant analysis was employed as a statistical technique. The study findings indicate that it's feasible to evaluate the absorptive capacity level using the model indicators and that the available relevant knowledge is the most potent determinant of absorptive capacity. The impact of the absorptive capacity on organizations' competitiveness was ascertained using the Balanced Scorecard model fundamentals. The study results suggest that controlling the absorptive capacity determinants within the provided structure is achievable. These findings will enhance the understanding of the absorptive capacity framework in sectors with a profound dependence on knowledge adoption and employment for future growth, which is critical for developing competitiveness of knowledge-based economies including the Republic of Serbia, as determined by its strategic direction. The devised model can furnish management aid in the realms of organizational learning, and knowledge and innovation management.
