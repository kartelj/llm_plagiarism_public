Modern society development hinges significantly on superior telecommunication networks. Ensuring these networks have high availability, alongside end user services, is important. Today, several dozen nodes typically make up backbone networks, creating a challenge for calculating availability. Precise calculation algorithm execution times exponentially increase with node and link quantities. Hence, approximation algorithms are crucial during network designing to help define the initial design conditions. This doctoral thesis primarily introduces a new method for estimating the maximum availability of complex telecommunication networks. For obtaining maximum availabilities, network synthesis was a method employed. This new method initially views network topology as a chain. When it comes to determining maximum network availability, ring formation is the first synthesis step. Subsequent steps involve successive link addition into the network topology until it provides an overall availability increase. By adding a single link with constant availability, network synthesis is conducted in which each step offers maximum availability to a given number of nodes, links and link availabilities. Approximation functions of maximum network availability for identical numbers of nodes, links and link availabilities are obtained by analysing maximum availability network synthesis method results. Network availability limits can be calculated based on these approximation functions. Moreover, these functions can define the boundaries within which link numbers need to shift to reach the desired availability based on proper network topology choices. This thesis proves that all nodes must have matching, or nearly similar, connectivity for the network to have maximum availability. By starting with this rule and knowing the number of network links, the design process can occur in several iterations to achieve the desired network topology. This dissertation defined approximation function execution time is independent of network size. It enables a large volume of calculations which facilitates analysis of plentiful input parameter combinations. These approximation functions are considerably more accurate than previously published functions as shown in the thesis. When approximate values are compared to exact availability values, the approximation relative error, greater than 0.75, is substantially below 1% for networks.
