The proposed study introduces a new method for tracking student attention using Internet of Things and machine learning algorithms. The primary thesis of this PhD dissertation confirmed that the application of the Internet of Things in education improves instructional effectiveness. This is achieved by having a system that detects students' focus, allowing for the examination of environment conditions and the presentation of evaluated results. A study on relevant computer and social science research has been conducted to enrich the understanding needed for these processes execution and to demonstrate the importance of conducting this feature-focused study. The review comprises a comparative study of smart classroom platforms, acting as the conduit for these novel algorithms to surface and identify sociological scenarios at their inception. Sociological sciences are crucial as they underscore the foundation of being observed and categorized sociological processes; consequently, a review of sociological sciences and particularly social signals, is offered to complete the study of pertinent research and set a path for the suggested system's future application. In addition, the review has also highlighted potential parameters and algorithms that can be utilized, accompanied by a thorough explanation of the research phases' methodology. Subsequently, the system's needs have been assessed, and essential detection features and the sociological elements that impact them have been identified. Pattern classification is executed through a machine learning technique that requires a classifier based on a specific dataset. Prior to execution, a system simulation is carried out on a dataset not employed in the training process. During this simulation, the system attained an average precision of 92.2%. Following the simulation, the system was implemented and performance was examined by comparing real-time annotator feedback (i.e. the students' responses) to the system's output during classes. The system's average precision assessed for three distinct student groups was 81.9%.
