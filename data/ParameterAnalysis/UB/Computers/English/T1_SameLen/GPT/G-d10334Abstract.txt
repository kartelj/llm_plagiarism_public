The primary goal of this research is to suggest and empirically test a comprehensive model of retail customer loyalty in Serbia. A literature review on crucial factors influencing service customer loyalty, like service quality, satisfaction, and perceived value, preceded primary research. The investigation involved a structured survey on a convenience sample of 737 retail customers from non-specialised, predominantly food stores, using methods of multivariate data analysis, implemented via software packages SPSS 18 and LISREL 8.80. Outcomes from the exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis imply a multidimensional character of service quality construct within the Serbian retail context. Four elements of retail service quality were found, identified as: (F1) Employee behaviour and appearance, (F2) Atmospherics, (F3) Customer communication, and (F4) Spatial layout and assortment. The structural equation modelling pointed out customer satisfaction as the most crucial factor of customer loyalty, followed by perceived value, whose overall effect was both direct and indirect on loyalty, mediated via satisfaction. The research's results also present substantial influence of service quality on customer loyalty. Though this latent variable did not have a statistically significant direct effect on customer loyalty, it indirectly influenced customer loyalty, via the mediating variables of satisfaction and perceived value. The study's results emphasise the need to measure and enhance customer satisfaction and perceived value, alongside service quality, to cultivate a loyal customer base. Because the study utilised a convenience sample of retail customers, future research should focus on developing a service quality scale and measuring customer satisfaction and perceived value using a representative sample of Serbian retail customers.
