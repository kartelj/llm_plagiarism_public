'E-learning is an intricate system comprising remote education, lectures, and different types of virtual educational materials, as well as both personal and collaborative learning techniques, tutoring, and interactive tasks. The rapid and noticeable growth in user numbers, services, instructional materials, and necessary resources, confronts educational institutions and their e-learning systems with new optimization challenges, dynamic competitiveness requirements, and cost management. All of these factors result in more complicated requirements for the design and application of IT structures in e-learning systems. Leveraging contemporary information and communication technologies can enhance the efficiency, adaptability, and affordability of e-learning systems. Implementing modern IT infrastructure models for e-learning, grounded in the modern IT notion of Cloud Computing, can enhance the reliability, scalability and cost-effectiveness of educational processes. The underdevelopment of scientific backing in utilizing the Cloud Computing concept in modeling the IT infrastructure in Serbia's higher education sector and the strategic significance of this concept suggest a need to establish theoretical support for its more effective progress and use. Accordingly, the focus of the dissertation research is outlined, centered on determining and evolving initiatives and tasks of higher education institutions associated with creating an IT infrastructure model for e-learning using Cloud Computing. By investigating existing and exploring new ways of offering services to students and scientific researchers, higher education institutions encounter numerous challenges, mainly associated with digital identity and access control. The foremost and possibly most significant challenge is encouraging the acceptance and enactment of digital identity management systems. A successful IT infrastructure for digital identity management necessitates an analytical approach about identities and their interrelationships. The next challenge is to back a system that could leverage all benefits from federation systems for digital identity management. Crafting such federations among educational institutions enables user, content, and services mobility. The central supposition developed and confirmed during the doctoral thesis is that the use of a designed IT infrastructure model can impact the efficiency and affordability of e-learning systems. The research part of the doctoral thesis, intended to validate the suggested IT infrastructure model for e-learning, was conducted at the E-Business Laboratory in the Faculty of Organizational Sciences. The research results demonstrated that the implemented IT infrastructure model enabled the e-learning system to be more proficient, adaptable, and cost-effective.
