Wireless sensor networks are systems comprising several small computing devices known as sensor nodes. These individual nodes perform the tasks of collecting environmental data through one or more sensors and establishing radio communications with other nodes in the network. These networks can generate extensive data, making them ideal for applying machine learning techniques. This work aims to adapt selected data mining algorithms for distributed execution directly on the sensor nodes.

The evaluation of the problem led to the identification of three primary prerequisites for distributed data mining algorithm fit for execution in a wireless sensor network. The initial requirement is to minimize the communication among the nodes since communication significantly drains energy. Second, the accuracy of the algorithm's results is crucial. Lastly, reliance on centralized computational resources should be minimized as much as possible.

The most substantial contribution of this thesis lies in introducing two novel distributed machine learning algorithms that meet wireless sensor network execution requirements. The first algorithm is a classification scheme with two layers. The first layer operates on the sensor nodes and can employ any classifier type (tested with J48 decision trees). The outcomes of this step are then relayed to a centralized second-layer classifier based on a weighted voting system. The second algorithm, a clustering algorithm, is based on Kohonen neural networks, adapted to the data nature collected from the sensor nodes. The data showcase two variability sources: event location information, and the properties of the occurred event. Based on these observations, a proposed two-layered Kohonen neural network clusters data concerning the originating location and the underlying event type.

Calculations prove that both proposed algorithms significantly conserve energy. The algorithms' accuracy was established through computational simulations. Finally, the proposed solutions are well-suited for various practical applications, and machine learning provides a sustainable solution for constructing extensive wireless sensor networks.
