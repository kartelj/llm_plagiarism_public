The PhD thesis' key subject belongs to the sphere of the information society, inclusive of its progression and systematic means of documenting and evaluating its growth. It compiles existing investigations and theories on the topic of the information society, its evolution, multiple forms, factors contributing to its expansion, and several international endeavours targeted at directing the worldwide advancement of the information society. By studying ways to measure the information society as an intricate concept defined by an assortment of closely interrelated indicators, the thesis explores the most suitable metrics that would facilitate monitoring, quantifying and assessment of the actual condition of the information society. Besides presenting categories and progression paths of benchmark indicators that form the basis of every methodology aimed at quantifying the information society, the thesis also includes an overview of the most key methodologies used globally for assessing the information society. Despite this, the main emphasis of this work is on the crafting of a unique model outlining needed actions for monitoring and evaluating advancement in Serbia's information society. This model assumes: • a theoretical basis, • alignment with European Union (EU) standards, which permits its widespread usage in projects involving international comparative analysis, • harmonisation with the unique aspects of Serbian information society and Serbia's existing potential for investment and ongoing development. The model's development has involved: • selecting a set of Information Society Indicators (ISI) in line with EU standards, albeit with adjustments concerning Serbian characteristics and potential for development, • transforming the ISI set to facilitate their ranking based on importance for tracking the information society, • deriving the most notable ISI subset, • Constructing a sub-model that quantifies digital divide using a distinct combined indicator - the Digital Polarization Index (DPI). The created model was then validated using Serbia as a case study, by overseeing and analysing its information society over five years. Verification comprised of: • statistical supervision, measuring and relevant data scrutiny, and • analysis of outcomes to determine the current state, identify and quantify critical development aspects of Serbia’s information society, and forecast its future development. The thesis offers a professional contribution in evaluating Serbia’s information society development from both population and economic perspectives. Moreover, it presents a measurement and evaluation of digital divide intensity and its trajectories, as well as identifying highly ‘digitally’ underdeveloped demographic groups in Serbia. Fundamental scientific contribution has been made in formulating a model for overseeing and appraising the development of the information society. The model is founded on the I-distance method and cluster analysis which are two suitably combined multivariate analysis methods. The original indicator set was culled to a subset of the most crucial ones, post-ranking in accordance with their I-distance value and application of cluster analysis. The sub-set obtained includes the most significant indicators based on 'information quantity' required for assessing the information society. Reducing the number of indicators while conserving valuable data enhances this model's practical usability. Additionally, the thesis sets out a model for quantifying individual and total digital divide in various sectors, by introducing the digital polarization index. Key characteristics of this model include its broadness, versatility and amenability to adding or modifying fundamental components. This permits the potential identification, definition, and computation of various individual digital polarization sub-indices, used in calculating total DPI (determined by arbitrarily selected indicator sets and arbitrarily chosen subgroup samples). These model attributes contribute greatly to its utility in high-change ICT conditions. The social contribution of the thesis is the extensive applicability potential of its findings in the fields of monitoring and calculating the information society and in steering and aligning its development. The developed model could serve as a strategic decision support tool and a tool for observing and minimizing the digital divide. Moreover, it could assist in evaluating diverse intricate social phenomena, outside the information society's scope.
