Conducting business in a contemporary setting requires maintaining relationships with multiple stakeholders. Building and sustaining these relationships are viewed as pivotal business objectives since a consistent business network is regarded as a vital asset of a firm. Communications play a key role in these relationships, making strategic or corporate communication an essential part of the company-stakeholder relation. This type of communication focuses on the creation and positioning of the corporate brand, a point made clear in the dissertation. The responsibility of corporate communication in relationship management is to streamline and organize all company communication. The idea of corporate branding is a subject of interest for both academics and practitioners because its impact on business outcomes is established. It is recognized as a significant source of lasting competitiveness and a crucial component of corporate strategy. Positioning a firm's brand involves how it is perceived against competitors, and how stakeholders view the company in relation to these competitors. After appraising related literature on positioning and its use in corporate branding, this dissertation examines the uniqueness, kinds, and structure of corporate brand positioning. Drawing on academic and professional literature, and analyzing empirical research findings, a strategic framework for corporate communication management is devised for the purpose of corporate brand positioning. The research author used empirical studies to create a model of corporate brand positioning and establish a Corporate Brand Positioning Score (CBPS). The research examined and quantified factors of business that influenced corporate brand positioning amongst six citizens/business community, the influence of business aspects on brand positioning, and determined the model structure and measured corporate branding among citizens/business community. Additionally, it revealed how demographic characteristics of citizens or business community traits influence the relationship between the perception of business aspects and corporate brand positioning. The research found that perceptions of components like Perception position, Company Attitude, Social Responsibility, Management, and Companies/Products significantly influenced corporate brand positioning among Serbian citizens. In developing the corporate brand positioning model and determining CBPS for the business community, characteristics of the corporate brand were used, including Reliability, Neutrality, Efficiency, Independence, Compliance, Employee relationships, Social responsibility, Understanding of smaller companies, Professionalism, and Credibility. For corporate brand positioning, enhancing the identified determinants is crucial as their values impact the CBPS. The research findings highlight aspects essential for positioning the corporate brand among citizens and the business community and provide a foundation for strategic communication with stakeholders.
