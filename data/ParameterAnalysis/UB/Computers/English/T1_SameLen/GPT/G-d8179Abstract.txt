This thesis focuses on the creation and utilization of an interoperable e-business model for payment systems, which is based on ontologies and the Resource-Event-Agent - REA (ISO/IEC 15944-4:2007) ontological system structure. Global financial industry standards for information exchange serve as the foundation for this research. It applies insights and learnings from the implementation of the Check Clearing and Direct Debit systems within the Association of Serbian Banks, created using Enterprise Integration Patterns (EIP) and standardized message systems. The research will be tailored to the implementation of interoperable payment systems in Serbia. Different payment systems, which take part in electronic transactions, interact with various participants' business systems. These business systems support numerous users and business processes, each with unique requirements. A primary issue is the disparity between business processes, data, and IT technologies, leading to wasted time, financial and information resources in data transfer from one system to another. Today, electronic financial transactions have become predominant, calling for the development of interoperable e-business payment system models for their exchange and processing. This study argues that standardization in the area of payment system modeling can contribute to enhancing the efficiency of other electronic business systems and participants' interoperability. In each country, a payment system involves various payment instruments, banking procedures, and fund transfer systems between financial institutions, facilitating the flow of money within the country. The Central Bank plays a direct role in defining, regulating, and directing the monetary flow, thereby functioning as a financial flow regulator through payment systems control. The Real Time Gross Settlement System - RTGS is of utmost importance as it is primarily monitored by the Central Bank and connects the systems of banks and other financial institutions. These institutions include clearing houses, payment agents, processing houses, and others defined by law, which handle the implementation, processing, information acquisition or distribution related to financial transactions, as well as other electronic business systems. This work argues that payment systems unify elements found in every system based on messages, technology elements of supervising institutions mandated by the standard message format, environmental conditions influenced by the location with the implemented payment system (in financial vertical, the type of processing committed to, geo-political typology, and other possible factors), necessary communication interaction, and information technologies needed for the completion of general and specific tasks. As formal descriptions of objects, characteristics, and relationships in a specific domain, ontologies are explicitly understandable to both humans and computers. In this work, the ontological approach brings interoperability and consistency to the model and enhances the model design from a domain knowledge perspective. The ISO 15944-4:2007 standard, investigated in this study, establishes an ontological foundation for the concept specification and relations included in business transactions and scenarios known as the Resource-Event-Agent - REA ontology.
