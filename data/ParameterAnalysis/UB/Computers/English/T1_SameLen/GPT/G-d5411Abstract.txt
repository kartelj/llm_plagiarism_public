'The study detailed in this thesis focuses on identifying fuzzy functional dependencies within fuzzy relational database models. The objective encompasses evaluating and scrutinizing recent findings in this area and formulating a unique algorithm to discern dependencies among attributes in fuzzy relations based on fuzzy implication within fuzzy logic. The issue of analyzing fuzzy functional dependency in fuzzy relational database models is not a new one. There has been a considerable amount of literature and various authors addressing this topic over the past twenty years. However, a review of the literature revealed a lack of algorithms that can pinpoint relationships among attributes in relational schemas. This gap prompted the creation of our methodology for analyzing fuzzy functional dependencies across a specific set of attributes. The resolution of this relatively old problem is not just an academic challenge with theoretical bearings but also has practical relevance. The application of logical database models backed by prior theory and assimilated into other areas and fields (GIS, Data Mining, Information Retrieval, data redundancy reduction, null value estimation, etc.) is a key goal of this paper. It was hypothesized that fuzzy set theory and a specific component of fuzzy logic are the ideal solution when database managers are unable to definitively ascertain the relationships among data and attributes within a relationship. In the realm of artificial intelligence, fuzzy sets and fuzzy logic are examined in the context of fuzzy relational database design within intelligent systems because fuzzy set theory and fuzzy logic are effective resources for handling and denoting vague and uncertain information. The detection of potential dependencies among attributes in fuzzy relations is, in essence, a data mining technique that uncovers hidden and useful knowledge for decision-making. This thesis introduces a novel technique for detecting existing dependencies between tuple pairs using various fuzzy implications characterized by the author. Fuzzy implications that meet set acceptance criteria are employed to estimate semantic strength θ when fuzzy functional θ dependency X → Y is met. To validate the proposed methodology and research, we conducted an experiment on actual data via two distinct models: a fuzzy database model rooted in close relation and a fuzzy database model featuring possibility distribution. Unearthing potential dependencies among attributes of the observed fuzzy relation essentially entails uncovering hidden and useful knowledge, i.e., a data mining technique. To determine fuzzy functional dependency within the corresponding fuzzy model, we need to: 1. Prep the data for analysis (preprocessing, data summarization, data warehousing, etc.). 2. Identify subrelations (n-tuples) on observed attributes potentially harboring hidden fuzzy functional dependencies. 3. Correlate fuzzy functional dependencies with corresponding fuzzy implications. 4. Decipher search findings to derive the final fuzzy dependency set. From in practical terms, in seeking fuzzy functional dependencies within fuzzy database models using the suggested methodology, it's necessary to carry out efficiency analysis as well. A primary drawback that might surface is the sheer number of transactions (possible tuple pairs with associated values) requiring computation, potentially costly for large databases. An uptick in tuple numbers and relational scheme attributes exponentially augments the tuple count. Nonetheless, in this doctoral paper, we posit and demonstrate that an increase in algorithm efficiency is achievable and a decrease in computed transactions is possible. However, we need to underscore that the issue at hand dictates the algorithm's effectiveness. Some databases don't require compression, while in other circumstances, massive databases call for various reduction techniques, like data summarization built on fuzzification, cluster creation, granulation, and representing a multitude of similar tuples with one representative tupe, and so on. Broadly speaking, our research teaches us how to pull intelligent information from fuzzy relational databases. To unearth potential relationships among fuzzy relation attributes, we first need to ready the data for analysis, meaning we must establish a table with tuple pairs and compliance values for all original relation attributes. The next move is to locate sub-relations that satisfy the existence criteria for fuzzy dependencies. The third step involves associating fuzzy functional dependencies with corresponding fuzzy implications. Lastly, we interpret the outcomes of the preceding steps to reach the final fuzzy functional dependency set. The primary contribution of this thesis lies in the characterization of fuzzy set theory and fuzzy implications with regard to developing tools and algorithms that simplify the detection of relationships among attributes in the relational schemes under observation. It's worth noting that this paper constitutes an empirical study and serves as a "proof-of-concept", devoid of developed commercial software. Furthermore, we looked at specific practical situations where this methodology could come in handy. Our experiments indicate that the results yielded by the algorithm are satisfactory. For future endeavors, we plan to apply this research in various scenarios and applications that involve this methodology, such as estimating null values in relational databases, text mining, extracting dependencies from practical knowledge databases, and so forth.'
