Access of pixels in memory is a recognized performance barrier for SIMD (Single-Instruction Multiple-Data) processors used for image and video processing. This thesis introduces a novel parallel on-chip memory subsystem solution that features new functions and an enabling architecture, which achieves higher processing throughput and lower energy consumption per processed pixel relative to existing state-of-the-art subsystems. 

The document initially outlines new functionalities of a parallel memory subsystem, specifically new block and row access modes, better suited to the requirements of image and video processing algorithms than existing parallel memory subsystem functionalities. These new access modes significantly decrease the number of on-chip memory read and write accesses, resulting in accelerated imaging/video kernels such as sub-pixel block-matching motion estimation, pixel interpolation for motion compensation, and spatial window-based filtering. The primary idea behind these new modes is to benefit from spatial overlaps of blocks/rows in the memory subsystem known at the subsystem design-time and meld multiple accesses into a singular one by accessing slightly more pixels at a time compared to other parallel memories. To prevent requiring a broader - and thus more expensive SIMD datapath - the study suggests new memory read operations that separate all pixels accessed at a time into multiple SIMD-wide blocks/rows, in a manner conducive to additional processing. Alongside higher processing throughput, these novel access modes reduce the energy used by the parallel memory subsystem for the same volume of processed pixels, by lowering the number of repeated pixel accesses.

Secondly, the thesis presents a parametric, scalable, and cost-effective architecture supporting the new access modes along with access modes of current parallel memory subsystems for proof of concept and solution completeness. The architecture relies on: 1) a previously suggested collection of memory banks providing multiple pixels for each addressable word of a bank, 2) a prior proposed shifted arrangement for organizing pixels in banks that permit parallel access to all block/row pixels, and 3) control logic implementing the shifted scheme in memory banks and access modes, thereby offering a user-friendly and efficient programming interface.

Intel's most cutting-edge processors and system-on-chip solutions for mobile devices' imaging and video processing presently utilize the proposed parallel memory subsystem thanks to its verified efficiency and it is consistently being refined for application in future Intel processor generations. Its benefits are demonstrated in a 3DRS sub-pixel block-matching motion estimation algorithm case study. It can process 3840*2160 video at 60 frames per second while being clocked at 600 MHz. Compared to six state-of-the-art subsystems and the same SIMD datapath, it results in 40 - 70% higher throughput, consumes 17 - 44% less energy, and has comparable silicon area and off-chip memory bandwidth costs. It is thus 1.8 - 2.9 times more efficient than previous state-of-the-art implementations, calculated as the throughput to the product of all costs: energy usage, silicon area, and off-chip memory bandwidth. Such high efficiency is a result of the new access modes and cost-effective architecture, which reduced on-chip memory accesses by 1.6 - 2.1 times.
