The selection of a routing plan within a packet network greatly influences the reliability and overall quality of data transmission. This selected plan also affects how different network resources are used, with poor choices leading to network bottlenecks and throttled throughput. Other factors, including network latency and cost, are also dependent on the selected routing method. To identify the best strategy for a given network and anticipated traffic volume, routing optimization is performed. The optimal routing strategy aims to offer the maximum value for the chosen network performance metric. The optimization may focus on maximizing network throughput, minimizing network cost, reducing latency, etc.
In this study, we'll examine issues related to maximizing network throughput and minimizing network costs. Our focus will be on non-blocking networks, which ensure service to all users generating and receiving traffic within specified limits, regardless of current traffic distribution. We'll introduce a new routing scheme based on load balancing and shortest path routing, which we'll refer to as load balanced routing (LBR). This newly proposed routing protocol can be optimized using linear programming to either minimize cost or maximize network throughput.
This recommended routing model can be easily implemented in actual situations, given that shortest path routing methods are commonly used and this proposed system is a manageable modification. The scale of the linear program and the time required for optimization are both reasonable. The proposed system can serve more users compared to the traditional shortest path routing and is also cheaper for servicing a specific number of users.
We'll initially provide an overview of the recommended load balanced routing and the linear program for its optimization. We will then assess the performance of the suggested routing model and compare it with the shortest path routing performance. We'll focus on two scenarios, the first being optimizing the load balanced routing to achieve maximum network throughput and the second to achieve minimum network costs for a system that can support required user demands. The analyses will be carried out for both standard and realistic network topologies, including networks requiring service reliability due to single resource (link or router) failure. Our findings show that the performance of the recommended load balanced routing model surpasses that of the shortest path routing in all instances.
