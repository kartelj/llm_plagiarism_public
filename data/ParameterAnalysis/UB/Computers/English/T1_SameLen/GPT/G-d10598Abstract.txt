A review of literature revealed multiple perspectives concerning the idea of performance. Most methods agree that performance involves behaviours or actions congruent with organizational goals that can be quantified. Performance indicators serve as vital tools for corporate management, guiding them towards long-term strategies and effective short-term decision-making processes. Financial indicators, derived from current and past performance, are utilized to forecast potential business operations. These indicators are inherently linked with performance metrics from other business functions. Performance management acts as a comprehensive management system that incorporates other mechanisms, forming the basis for effective managerial decision making. This thesis aims to investigate the potential links between an organization's financial and business performance. The organization's success is established by one universally acknowledged method. A review of secondary sources and empirical studies conducted on the industry's most successful firms over a five-year period confirmed the fundamental hypothesis of a relationship between business success and financial performance indicators. The findings reveal that the financial performance indicators of most successful companies concentrate within specific ranges. A statistical analysis of the data demonstrated a significant relationship between certain financial performance indicators, company age, and industry. Consequently, the empirical research determined a substantial difference between certain financial performance indicators' values in more successful and less successful organizations. Based on the research data analysis, a novel managerial concept grounded on financial performance indicators has been proposed.
