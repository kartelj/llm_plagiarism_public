The number of internet-connectable digital multimedia devices within today's households, including smartphones, tablets, digital TVs and set-top boxes, has seen a substantial increase in recent years. These readily accessible, customizable devices have significantly simplified the development of distributed applications. In an integrated environment, these applications can yield innovative human-computer interaction (HCI) scenarios far beyond what a single device could provide. A study of existing HCI systems, especially those integrating digital TV and mobile devices in a living room setting, revealed ad-hoc implementations with limited flexibility and an inability to explore diverse HCI scenario combinations. This dissertation introduces the SHARP development framework, which facilitates efficient creation of distributed systems in an integrated environment comprising digital TV, mobile devices and the internet. The framework seeks to enable HCI researchers to construct innovative applications effortlessly, offering varied combinations of living room HCI scenarios. The dissertation commences with a survey outlining existing HCI systems designed for living room settings. Identified common attributes and potential HCI scenarios that integrated environment applications could offer, including multi-screen content sharing, mobile device-based central screen control, motion sensor detection, supplementary sensory feedback, concurrent TV viewing and interaction, enhanced user experience via multiple info services access, and interaction among locally and remotely situated individuals. The SHARP framework proposal, along with its design and implementation specifics, follows the scenario identification. The framework's design allows developers to incorporate the identified scenarios into their applications. The gaming development field was selected to validate the framework's advantages as games have proven popular and lucrative. Five distinct games were created using the SHARP framework to exhibit its versatility and demonstrate novel applications providing users with new scenario combinations. The acceptance of the identified scenarios by users was evaluated through the experiences of 59 test users interacting with the developed game applications. The SHARP framework's verification came through comparison of the size, complexity, and responsiveness of the applications developed with and without it. Results indicated that the framework decreased both development and testing efforts by shifting complex game implementation logic to reusable framework components. Despite the slight response time increase brought about by the framework's use, all response times remained well within performance acceptability bounds.
