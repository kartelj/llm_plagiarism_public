3D videos are progressively prevalent in both wired and wireless networks, contributing a substantial load due to their high data content. The burden of 3D video on network traffic necessitates enhancement of techniques to manage this kind of data. This thesis features the fractal and multifractal characterization of 3D video formats, aiming to demonstrate their fractal and multifractal traits, describe them, compare these properties across different 3D formats, forecast applications in traffic modeling of 3D video formats, and foster advanced transport methods for video smoothing and statistical multiplexing. Algorithms and software implementations for mathematical methods in the complex systems and chaos domains were created in Matlab and Python to determine fractal properties (using the aggregated variance method, R/S statistical method, and multiscale method) and multifractal properties (through the method of moments for multifractal spectra, estimation of generalized dimensions, and the histogram method for multifractal spectra and inverse multifractal analysis). Based on the findings, fractal and multifractal properties of 3D video formats are affirmed and compared across diverse 3D video formats, video structures, frame types, encoder quantization parameter values, frame aggregations, and video streaming methods.
