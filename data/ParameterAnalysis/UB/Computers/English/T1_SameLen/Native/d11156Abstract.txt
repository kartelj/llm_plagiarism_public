The objective of this dissertation is to show and explain the possibilities of improving decision-making on the selection of economically most acceptable bidder in the public e- procurement. This selection is based on pre-defined criteria that define the purchaser in public e- procurement. The selection is simple in situations where are couple bidders and when established quantitative criteria that can be mutually compared. However, real life and the practice create situations with large number of bidders and selection the most acceptable between them is made on the basis of qualitative and quantitative criteria. The main hypothesis in this dissertation which has been proven in the framework of the doctoral thesis is that the use of multi-criteria decision-making methods and the theory of fuzzy sets can improve the selection of economically most acceptable bidder in the public e- procurement when the selection use quantitative and qualitative criteria, at the same time. In this kind of selection it is possible to determine the values associated with the output variable corresponding to the weights of criteria which belong to a fuzzy set through defuzzification, i.e. selection of one value of output variable with the same quantification. At the same time, the thesis is presented decision support system based on the concept of multi- criteria decision making and the theory of fuzzy sets. This system is an integral part of the web portal for the public e-procurement, which allows the establishment of a collaborative work environment that seamlessly connects purchasers and providers into a single, virtual workspace for e-procurement.
