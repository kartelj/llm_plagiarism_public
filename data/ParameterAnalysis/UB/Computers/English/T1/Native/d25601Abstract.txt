Existing trends in computer design aim to raise the performance of computer systems to the highest possible level in order to meet the needs for processing large amounts of data. Attention isfocusedonthedesignofaprocessorasthemainactorinthedataprocessingprocess. Improvement trends in processor performance predicted by Moore’s Law has been slowing down recently due to physical limitations of semiconductor technology and increasing performance is getting harder and harder. This problem is attempted to be compensated by various techniques aimed at improving performancewithoutincreasingtransistorandpowerconsumption. Inthisthesis,asymmetricmulticoreprocessorswithsupportfortransactionalmemoryareconsid- ered. Two new techniques have been proposed to increase the performance of such processors. One technique aims to reduce transaction congestion due to high parallelism by migrating transactions to afastercore. Thetransactionsthatcontributethemosttoanoccurrenceofcongestionareselectedfor migration. Executing them on a faster core reduces their chances of conflict with other transactions andthusincreasesthechanceofavoidingcongestion. Anothertechniqueadjuststhecachesubsystem to reducecaches’ access latency and toreduce the chances offalse conflicts while reducingthe num- ber of transistors required to implement the cache. This can be achieved by using small and simple caches. Detailed implementation proposals are given for both techniques. Prototypes of these techniques were made in the Gem5 simulator, which models processor’s system in detail. Using prototypes, the proposed techniques were evaluated by simulating a large number of applications from a standard benchmark set for transactional memory. The analysis of the simulation results gave suggestions on howandwhentheproposedtechniquesshouldbeused.
