The literature review unveiled diverse perspectives on the idea of performance. The shared aspect among these perspectives is the measurable execution of activities or behaviors aimed at achieving organizational objectives. Performance indicators are crucial management tools that can aid in guiding management towards the most beneficial long-term strategies and in making effective short-term decisions. These indicators, along with financial indicators based on present and past performance, are used to predict future business operations. They form an integral part with other business function indicators. Performance management serves as a comprehensive management framework that merges other systems and establishes the foundation for suitable managerial decision-making.

This thesis aims to examine the potential linkage between financial performance and the organization’s overall performance. A generally accepted method determines the organization's success. An analysis of secondary sources and empirical studies conducted on the most successful companies over five years substantiates the primary hypothesis that business success correlates with financial performance indicators. The findings reveal a clear accumulation at certain intervals in the financial performance indicators of most successful companies. The data’s statistical analysis indicated a clear correlation between certain financial performance indicators and factors like the company’s age and industry. Hence, the empirical research identified a statistically significant difference in the values of certain financial performance indicators between more and less successful organizations.

Based on the research’s data analysis, a newly theoretical management concept was established, focusing on financial performance indicators.
