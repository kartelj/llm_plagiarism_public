The following thesis presents a model for interoperable e-business statistical systems, grounded in service-oriented architecture and web services, tailored for use in the Republic of Serbia's statistical system. As a vital element in any democratic society's information system, official statistics supply data concerning economic, demographic, societal and environmental conditions. Their primary role is to offer an accurate depiction of socioeconomic trends. Furthermore, they aim to provide a solid foundation for analyzing and decision-making at various levels, from government institutions to businesses and citizens. The Republic of Serbia’s official statistics operate based on the guidelines articulated in the Economic and Social Council of the UN - Basic Principles of Official Statistics and the European Commission’s Practical Code for European Statistics.

Most countries have one or more National Statistical Institutions (NSI) which together form the national statistical system. These institutions are responsible for data collection, storage, analysis, and distribution among different user groups. Within each NSI, statistical production occurs across various production lines, catering to distinctive statistical areas. Their business architecture is typically based on the stove-pipe model whereby an independent production line is set up for each statistical area within the NSI. Consequently, the full production process for each area is self-contained, from research planning to data collection and analysis. Each area has its own data, sources, and users.

Electronic data exchange has become a prevalent form of communication among statistical services. However, this method is consistently hampered by interoperability issues and a constant need for data conversion. This thesis suggests adopting universal standards for statistical data dissemination and exchange with the aim of crafting a universally acceptable set of standards, ensuring swift and efficient access to data and metadata. The service-oriented architecture of the statistical information system facilitates interoperability at both the application and business process levels. The system ensures semantic interoperability through the design of a shared domain ontology and the development of a shared data model based on that domain ontology.
