The introductory section of this thesis explores the analysis of routing protocols within data center infrastructures, concentrating primarily on two-phase routing protocols. These protocols help to prevent congestion, particularly within regular data center structures that offer numerous alternative routes. The thesis proposes a novel two-phase routing algorithm, LB-ECR, which enhances the utilization of data center networks. The LB-ECR algorithm uses linear programming to maximize the congestion-free throughput based on the required traffic of the switches. It is founded on ECMP routing, favorable in data centers due to its use of equal-cost alternative routes. The two-phase balancing procedure simplifies the linear model by removing traffic flows, lowering the likelihood of congestion through dispersion of traffic on less trafficked links. These modifications to the linear model facilitate its resolution within large data centers. The beginning section of this thesis provides a brief scrutiny of network structures, routing in data centers, and a comparative analysis of various routing algorithms' performance in standard data center configurations.

Alongside routing optimization, this thesis delves into the study of the algorithms used to update Internet routers' lookup tables. The second part of the thesis offers a summary of lookup and update algorithms. We evaluate the updating efficiency of two progressive lookup algorithms, create formulas to determine the worst-case memory requirements for two rapid lookup algorithms, and display the memory needs for regular routing tables through simulations. We assess the number of memory accesses to the lookup modules during updates, the complexity of the updates, and the execution duration for typical routing tables.

The final section of this thesis elucidates the implementation process of both two-phase routing algorithms and lookup update algorithms, including their integration within the router.
