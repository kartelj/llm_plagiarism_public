The cultivation of modern network environments, their utilization and their interaction with other contrasting technological aspects, hinges on the compatibility and use of diverse heterogeneous technologies. This complex networking realm is continuously subjected to various practical challenges, with securing services and data being a crucial responsibility. The continuous expansion in user numbers and the rapid creation of new applications demanding high bandwidth has set new standards for security systems. These standards focus on effectively comprehending and monitoring network traffic traits. 

Considering the progressive development of cyberattacks, continuous dynamic alterations in network traffic, and the increased diversity of technologies and devices, establishing solutions in anomaly and attack detection areas is a prerequisite. Although extensive literature recognizes countless papers scrutinizing network traffic flow analyses for network performance and security monitoring needs, only a few are rooted in the generation of network traffic behavior profiles or specific communication patterns. Accordingly, network behavior analysis is dependent on deciphering normal or acceptable behavior patterns, allowing for efficient detection of irregular, anomalous behavior patterns. 

This approach, contrasting from intrusion detection systems based on the packet payload or signature, is extremely beneficial for identifying unknown threats, zero-day attacks, unusual behavior, as well as enhancing overall network performance. This dissertation suggests a new tactic to detect attacks and anomalies, relying on profiling network traffic using only IP addresses and port numbers collected via the NetFlow protocol. 

The proposed solution leans on particular preprocessing of network traffic flows by applying entropy calculation on some traffic flow instance attributes. Then, additional attributes are calculated by aggregation techniques, representing the communication activity of participants in the monitored time interval. The dissertation provides a well-rounded exploration of the challenges in detecting and identifying anomalies and attacks in current network environments, advocating for a systematic approach to these issues. This approach starts from defined hypotheses, progresses to analyzing network traffic flow traits, and proposes a new solution combining different techniques. It incorporates pre-processing network traffic flows, entropy calculation of attribute values, their aggregation, the creation of distinct network traffic profile signatures, and the application of a modified hierarchical agglomerative clustering algorithm. 

At its core, the idea promotes swift and competent processing of real network environment data, even when working with unlabeled, incomplete and varying flow lengths. The proposed solution assumes that each data flow includes certain info and volumetric attributes, and it generates extra attributes or behavior attributes through the use of specific aggregation techniques. In this context, the aggregation is applied to each data flow, and the preprocessed attributes are interpreted as a unique communication flow signature. The primary dissertation goal is to discover a method that would enhance entropy-based techniques with the application of various machine learning algorithms. This goal leans on the proposition of two new approaches.
