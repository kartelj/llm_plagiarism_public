In the introductory section of this paper, we outline our principal areas of study and key objectives, establish important hypotheses and methods for the study, and provide an overview and summary of our dissertation, highlighting crucial aspects. Section two delves into the concept of efficiency and various approaches to its evaluation and measurement. Efficiency, a keystone of modern business decision-making, can be understood as the ability to minimize inputs and maximize outcomes. A central aim of this research was to develop a new statistical model of efficiency that can tackle the challenges of dealing with different types of input/output variables. We will explain the frequently used method, Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA), developed by Charnes, Cooper & Rhodes (1978) for measurement of organizational unit efficiency. Statistics method Stochastic Frontier Analysis (SFA) also forms part of our study. 

In chapter three, our attention shifts to multivariate data analysis, focusing on two key statistical techniques: principal component analysis (PCA) & factor analysis, and cluster analysis. The dissertation's central aim was to develop a novel statistical model based on the I-distance method. The fourth chapter thus focuses on the I-distance metrics in the n-dimensional space, a method developed by Prof. dr Branislav Ivanović (Ivanović 1972, 1973, 1977). This method was created for ranking countries based on a variety of indicators. In our dissertation, we focus on the applications of the I-distance method, including ranking of world's top universities and other case studies ranging from evaluation of national health to sport team rankings.

Chapter five presents our novel statistical efficiency model, the Distance Based Analysis (DBA), and its verification through multiple published examples. DBA was applied to assess the efficiency of university scientific output, banking sector, health sector, and regions in Serbia, providing insightful results confirmed by the DEA method. The study markedly advances both the methods for gauging efficiency and the I-distance method. In closing, we offer conclusions, responses to research issues and hypotheses, an overview of key scientific contributions and prospects for further research, an extensive bibliography and an appendix on the experiment for improving the I-distance method.
