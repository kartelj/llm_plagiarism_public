The thesis introduces a unique system for the visual presentation of cryptographic algorithms, called CryptOgraphic Algorithms visuaL simulAtion or COALA. The primary objective of this system is to facilitate the understanding of cryptographic algorithms for data security students, forming a solid foundation for more advanced topics. At the University of Belgradeâ€™s School of Electrical Engineering, the Data Security course spans from cryptographic algorithms to system security. Exam results indicated difficulties among students in grasping algorithm-related content, adversely affecting their overall exam performance. These findings led to the idea of incorporating a visual representation system for cryptographic algorithms in the course to address this issue. Similar systems are widespread in coursework related to software in the fields of computer engineering and information systems. Prior to its development, existing solutions were reviewed to determine if one already existed that could meet the course's requirements and define its successful implementation as an educational tool. Despite a wealth of algorithm visual representation systems (AV systems), only a few could visually represent cryptographic algorithms, and none catered adequately to the Data Security course. The study offers a systematic structure of such systems, highlighting their suitability for cryptographic algorithm representation, and proposes a method for development. By reviewing eLearning tools literature, an efficient education incorporation method is also defined. The COALA system allows comprehensive examination of all cryptographic algorithms discussed in lectures and practice sessions, showing the execution of supported algorithms in detail. The system accurately reflects the full configurability of algorithm parameters, allowing for easy and quick algorithm execution demonstrations through various examples. The paper also offers an overview of the eLearning tools field, systems for algorithm visual representation (AV systems), and systems for cryptographic algorithm visual representation. The COALA system's functionality and implementation details are further explained, along with descriptions of the supported cryptographic algorithms. The system supports five categories of cryptographic algorithms, with special emphasis on the specifics of the visual representation used in COALA.
