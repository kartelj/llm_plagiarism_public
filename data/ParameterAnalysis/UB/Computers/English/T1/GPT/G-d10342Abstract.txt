Economies reliant on knowledge are greatly dependent on its acquisition and usage to enhance their competitiveness. Large amounts of this necessary knowledge can be found both inside and outside organizations. As the global market becomes more dynamic, organizations are compelled to utilize knowledge flows to meet their needs and gain a competitive edge. They are constantly seeking to gain more knowledge in order to improve their business solutions and products, identify new market opportunities, strengthen their overall knowledge base, and predict the market's future. This highlights the significance of the concept of absorptive capacity, which pertains to the acquisition, assimilation, transformation, and application of knowledge at an organizational level. Though numerous studies have dissected absorptive capacity into various components and analyzed their attributes, this particular research examines the relationship and impact intensity between these components and dimensions of absorptive capacity as it pertains to organizations in technology and knowledge-intensive fields. To this end, a management model for absorptive capacity directing the flow of knowledge from acquisition to application was devised and used. The model is built upon the fragmentation of absorptive capacity into dimensions and components. The analysis of results from applying this model was aimed at determining the capability of assessing the influence of absorptive capacity on an organization's competitiveness. Both quantitative and qualitative research methods were utilized in this study. Collected data was evaluated using the absorptive capacity model and statistical discriminant analysis. The study's findings show it is possible to gauge the level of absorptive capacity through model indicators and that the availability of pertinent knowledge is a significant determinant of absorptive capacity. The impact of absorptive capacity on organizational competitiveness was established by employing the underlying principles of the Balanced Scorecard model. Based on the study's outcome, it is possible to manage the determinants of absorptive capacity within the presented framework. These conclusions will help better comprehend absorptive capacity within sectors that heavily rely on the adoption and application of knowledge, enhancing the competitiveness of knowledge-based economies. This is particularly crucial for developing economies like Serbia, which emphasizes a strategic focus on knowledge. The model designed can offer management support in organizational learning and in managing knowledge and innovation.
