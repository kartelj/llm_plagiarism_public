3D videos are becoming increasingly common in both wired and wireless networks, contributing significantly to network load due to their high data content. This heightened impact of 3D video on network traffic necessitates improvement in handling such data types. The focus of this thesis is on the fractal and multifractal characterization of 3D video formats, with primary objectives to demonstrate and describe the fractal and multifractal properties of 3D video. It also aims to make comparisons of these properties across different 3D formats, assess potential applications in traffic modeling of 3D video formats, and in the development of enhanced transport techniques for smoothing and statistical multiplexing of video. Algorithms and software solutions for mathematical methods in complex systems and chaos were developed using Matlab and Python. These were utilized for determining fractal (using aggregated variance method, R/S statistical method, and the multiscale method) and multifractal properties (using method of moments for multifractal spectra, estimation of generalized dimensions and the histogram method for multifractal spectra and inverse multifractal analysis). The findings confirmed the fractal and multifractal properties of 3D video formats, allowing for comparison across different 3D video formats, video structures, frame types, encoder quantization parameters, frame aggregation, and video streaming methods.
