Managerial control is a critical tool for a company's management, strategy implementation, and business enhancement. The effectiveness of this control is largely dependent on the information available to those making decisions, specifically data on past success and predictions for future organizational growth and earnings. Systems studying the measurement of past performance and future projections are thus critical for successful decision-making.

Managerial accountants and other management experts work tirelessly to develop the principles, concepts, techniques, and procedures required for developing these business performance measurement systems. Despite working on these issues for over a decade, the development and implementation of these systems are still in their early stages.

Nevertheless, they are a hot topic in management circles, sparking lively discussions about the optimal system. The primary objective of this doctoral thesis is to develop a novel business performance measurement system, focusing specifically on determining factors that impact the system's construction and usage.

This dissertation is based primarily on the contingency theory in management accounting, identifying a range of factors that influence the diversity and application of performance measurement systems. Then, the impact of these systems on the organization's financial and non-financial success is assessed.

Empirical data were utilized to validate the theoretical model, which, to the best of the author's knowledge, has not been conducted in Serbia before. While partial tests of contingency factor impact on business performance systems have been carried out outside Serbia, none have been as comprehensive as this doctoral thesis.

The results suggest that Serbian companies use a broad spectrum of performance measures. The theoretical model impacts both the diversity and usage of performance measurement systems, although their importance varies significantly. Furthermore, a balanced utilization of financial and non-financial performance indicators significantly influences business success.

These findings could prove beneficial to other researchers in the areas of performance measurement, management control, and management accounting. Practitioners, including consultants and managers, will also find these results helpful for constructing performance measurement systems within particular companies.
