Conducting business in a contemporary environment necessitates managing relationships with multiple stakeholders. Maintaining favourable relations with them is perceived as one of the primary objectives of business because a steady business network is considered as essential company capital. As interaction is a fundamental component of any relationship, strategic or corporate communications are perceived as crucial to the company-stakeholder relationship. These communications aim to build and position the corporate brand, as affirmed in the dissertation. The role of corporate communications is to coordinate and manage all company communications. Both academics and business practitioners show interest in the concept of corporate branding due to its proven effect on business outcomes. It is viewed as a significant source of sustainable competitive advantage and a critical component of corporate strategy. Within this context, positioning the corporate brand is perceived as a company's overall approach relative to its competitors, or how stakeholders perceive the company and its differentiation from competitors. Following a review of literature on positioning and its application to the corporate brand, this dissertation covers the specific detail, categories, and framework of corporate brand positioning. The author, leveraging scientific and professional literature and analysing empirical research results, creates a strategic framework for the management of corporate communications for the purpose of positioning the corporate brand. Using empirical research, the author developed a corporate brand positioning model and established the CBPS measure (Corporate Brand Positioning Score). The research identifies and measures business aspects influencing corporate brand positioning among six citizens/business community sectors. It determines the impact level of those aspects on corporate brand positioning and the structure of the model, measuring corporate brand positioning within the citizens/business community. The study also explores the effect of citizens' demographic characteristics, or business community traits, on the magnitude of the connection between the perception of particular business aspects and corporate brand positioning. Aspects examined in the research include Perception Position, Attitude Towards the Company, Social Responsibility, Management, and Companies/Products. The research provided evidence that each of these components, to varying degrees, affect the positioning of the corporate brand among Serbian citizens. For business community corporate brand positioning and CBPS determination, the corporate brand characteristics used include Reliability, Neutrality, Efficiency, Independence, Adherence to Principles, Positive Employee Relations, Social Responsibility, Understanding Smaller Companies, Professionalism, and Credibility. For corporate brand positioning, it's key to enhance the identified determinants since their values impact the CBPS. The research uncovers the critical aspects for positioning the corporate brand among the general public and the business community and signals the foundation for strategic stakeholder communications.
