The doctoral dissertation primarily focuses on the area of the information society, including the means to trace and measure its evolution. It comprises a summarization of the existing research and theories about an information society's growth, different forms, accelerating factors and numerous global initiatives intended to guide its worldwide advancement. The dissertation additionally explores the potential methods to quantify the information society as a complex concept, defined by a series of interrelated indicators. It investigates the most suitable metrics for monitoring, measuring and assessing the actual state of the information society.

Furthermore, the study sheds light on the classification and evolution of benchmarking indicators essential for every methodology aimed at quantifying the information society. It also provides an overview of the most commonly applied methodologies for global information society evaluation. However, the focal point of the study is the development of a unique model dedicated to tracing and assessing developments in the Serbian information society.

The assumptions of this model are its theoretical foundation, its consistency with the EU standards, and its compatibility with the particular features of the Serbian information society and Serbia's investment and progression potential. The model's formulation involved the selection of appropriate Information Society Indicators (ISI) aligned with EU standards but adapted to Serbia's unique characteristics and growth prospects. It also involved the transformation of the ISI set to prioritize the importance of monitoring the information society, the extraction of the most relevant ISI, and defining a sub-model to quantify the digital divide degree using the unique compound indicator called the Digital Polarization Index (DPI). 

The model was subsequently verified using Serbia as the test case, analyzing a five-year data period. The verification incorporated statistical tracking, data quantification and analysis, and result interpretation to establish the current state, locate and quantify 'critical points' in Serbian information society development, and predict future progress.

The study contributes professionally by evaluating the development of the Serbian information society from both the population and economic perspective. It also quantifies and evaluates the intensity and trends of the digital divide, targeting the most digitally underdeveloped Serbian population groups.

From a scientific viewpoint, the study contributes through the model's formulation for monitoring and assessing information society development. The model reduces the initial set of indicators to only the most relevant ones after ranking based on their I-distance value and applying cluster analysis. By minimizing the indicator count, the model's practical application is significantly enhanced.

Additionally, the study introduces a model to quantify the individual and total digital divide in various sectors by integrating a digital polarization index. Its primary attributes include its versatility, adaptability, and the ease to add or modify its fundamental elements.

The study's societal contribution includes its broad application potential in monitoring and quantifying the information society and in steering and aligning its development. The formulated model may serve as a strategic decision-making tool facilitating digital divide observation and reduction. It can also support the evaluation of different complex social phenomena outside the information society framework.
