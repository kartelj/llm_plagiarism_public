The study concern in this dissertation pertains to the massive quantity of data and insufficient information in business reporting systems. Despite being saturated with tables and charts, these reports primarily consist of data - often graphically represented - with little to no accompanying information. People using these reports are required to manually interpret this data; as a result, they may overlook significant details due to oversaturation of data, tiredness, lack of focus, inadequate knowledge or experience, subjectivity, or even dishonesty. This study therefore suggests automating the process of converting data into useful information. The suggested method is rooted in the understanding that data transforms into information when given meaning, and this meaning is derived from relevant knowledge. It is proposed that expert system techniques and technologies be used to automate the interpretation of key performance indicators. Specifically, classes are to represent declarative knowledge and rules and fuzzy theory to represent procedural knowledge. The resulting information is obtained via forward chaining and fuzzy inference, and then transformed into sentences akin to natural language using canned text.

The present scenario of business intelligence and expert systems is first reviewed, followed by a detailed theoretical explanation, a deliberation on the pros and cons of the proposed solution, and the plan for its implementation. A prototype - PT (Enterprise Profit Interpretation Tutor) application demonstrates the approach, enabling tests and validation of the hypotheses. The application feeds reports containing data - in the form of graphics and tables - and information rendered as natural-language-like sentences. An evaluative study involving students who use PT as an instructional aid was conducted. The findings reveal that students find PT beneficial and user-friendly. Though the explanations provided in the reports are considered helpful and easy to comprehend, they could be more extensive. A majority of the students polled contend that PT somewhat enhances their knowledge and offers a relatively faster and more engaging approach to mastering profit interpretation. 

A comparative assessment of explanation facilities in contemporary expert system development and business tools is discussed in this paper. JEFF (an explanation facility created for the prototype) is evaluated to assess the success in achieving objectives and its position in relation to similar tools. Almost all targets prove successful and JEFF is nearly parallel to its professional counterpart. Cumulative results support the hypotheses that the proposed methods and techniques would be effective for information creation, but the method was not tested in a corporate context. The prototype validates the feasibility of implementing the method, but its efficacy was only evaluated in terms of student teaching aids, not as a management data interpretation tool. If implemented in a real-world scenario, applications would need to be customized to address managers' needs and operate within a business environment.
