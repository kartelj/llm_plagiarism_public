The thesis research revolves around online, frontier-based strategies for environmental exploration. It utilizes the D* Lite algorithm for robot path planning and leverages multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) procedures to determine their next positions. The decision-making process consists of three criteria: having a collision-free path, the predicted information gain, and base station proximity. The effectiveness of the investigation was measured by the average robot path travel relative to several initial positions, specifically regarding the exploration requirement of 90% of the environment. Matlab simulations demonstrated that under specified conditions, the TOPSIS provides more effective strategic exploration than the other two MCDM methods (SAW and COPRAS), and the four traditional strategies of professional literature. This effectiveness occurs due to the TOPSIS's maximization of Euclidean distance from an assumed worst-case solution, which minimizes decision-making risks in a complex environment. The Gazebo 3D simulator, with its Robot Operating System, confirmed these essential findings.

Additionally, the thesis proposes two methodologies to enhance robot path planning for search and rescue operations. The first method integrates the D* Lite algorithm with fuzzy logic to determine map cell costs for robot path planning without relying on binary values. This approach allows for priority-based object exploration and avoids potential movement interference with other robots. The second method merges D* Lite algorithm with online learning, which results in a reduction in the mapping robot's path and minimizes risky movements. It facilitates pre-emptive obstacle avoidance maneuvers before a potential encounter.
