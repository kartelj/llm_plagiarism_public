The implementation of business intelligence systems, data integration, and decision-making support relies heavily on data warehouses. Constructing a dimensional model is typically necessary to improve data visualization in these warehouses. The structure and connection of basic elements within a data warehouse are characterized by its architecture. There are two leading strategies for data warehouse architecture. The first one, CIF (Corporate Information Factory) architecture, advocated by Bill Inmon, states that data warehouses should be normalized and hold atomic data in third normal form. On the other hand, Ralph Kimball's BUS architecture posits that warehouses should also have a multi-dimensional shape.

Daniel Linstedt developed a middle-ground method, the Data Vault concept, which stresses the importance of preserving historical data and links between normalized tables, each supporting one or more business facets. This strategy combines key features from third normal form (3NF) and star scheme, underscoring the necessity of recording data origin and timing in the database. It also accommodates changes in the data warehouse structure in line with business environment shifts. Despite the variety of methodological approaches employed in constructing data warehouses, the design process and related dimensional model are not automated.

This dissertation examined the issues associated with the data warehouse design process, conducted a comprehensive literature analysis, and explored the feasibility of automating physical data warehouse design through the Data Vault concept, requiring minimal human interaction. We developed a simple algorithm for automated physical data warehouse design using a data model with metadata transactional data sources and set rules.

We have formulated, generalized, and mostly automated the process of physical design for data warehouses using the algorithm, which is applicable to structured, semi-structured and simple non-structured data sources. Both the Data Vault implementation and the original data rely on a relational model, which is incorporated into a meta-model. The Physical Data Vault (PDV) is derived directly from the physical data source model in relational form. Additionally, the work introduces a conceptualization of metadata and a physical data model that, with minor modifications, can be used to design individual data warehouses, this being the core methodological contribution of the work.

Moreover, the work provides a holistic integrated approach to automating data warehouse design, enabling the construction of data marts and associated ETL processes. This type of integration facilitates all necessary activities for the realization of a complete data warehouse. Referring to the findings of the study, a prototype application was developed to support the physical design of data warehouses. Testing the algorithm on a real-world case in healthcare insurance using the prototype application yielded satisfactory results.
