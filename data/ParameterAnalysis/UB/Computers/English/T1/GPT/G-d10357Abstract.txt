Continuous education and training are fundamental aspects of modern societal progress, particularly in regards to technological advancements and global business. In the 21st century, with the rise of IT and technological progression, scientific knowledge and new scientific fields have rapidly evolved, leading to quicker and more efficient methods of education and learning. One key emerging science, known as Educational Data Mining, seeks to analyze and deduce patterns from educational data, enhancing our understanding of student behavior and thus facilitating educational advancement.

This PhD thesis investigates the potential application of business intelligence in the spectrum of education, with the goal of identifying key components contributing to a student's academic success and thereby improving the higher education system. Techniques and tools from various domains are applied to determine crucial variables from a student's background and high school education which may predict their academic success.

The thesis gives an expansive overview of current research in the field of data mining in education, particularly higher education, and proposes a novel approach for predicting academic performance indicators. In addition, the thesis suggests an original software solution for analyzing, tracking, and predicting undergraduate student success within a comprehensive portal connecting the student and the faculty.

Following an introduction of the research objectives and plan, the thesis explores fundamental concepts of business intelligence and data mining in the first four chapters. Various software environments and analytical techniques are used to develop a prediction model from the fifth to eighth chapter. The ninth chapter compares these models and identifies the contributing factors to academic success. 

The thesis ends by summarizing key results and guidelines for future development of predictive models, and provides a bibliography and two appendices. The first appendix presents case studies using the developed system, and the second provides a comprehensive analysis of influential factors impacting student performance.

In summary, the PhD thesis presents an extensive study on the use of business intelligence to analyze and predict academic success in higher education. This research may benefit not only professors and educational institutions for managing higher education, but also students and corporations seeking early identification of potential apprentices or employees. The final contribution of the thesis is the recommendation of 14 high-performing prediction models and the identification of crucial factors determining academic success, which may be implemented by other educational systems with minimal changes to improve and promote academic education.
