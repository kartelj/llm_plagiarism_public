Wireless sensor networks are made up of several tiny computing devices, known as sensor nodes. These nodes, equipped with one or more sensors, gather environmental data and establish radio connections with other network nodes. With the capacity to generate copious amounts of data, these networks are ideal for implementing machine learning processes. The focus of this work is to tweak specific data mining algorithms for distributed performance, enabling them to operate directly on the sensor nodes.

The problem analysis has resulted in three key prerequisites for a distributed data mining algorithm, which will run well on a wireless sensor network. First, minimizing node communication is critical due their high energy consumption. Next, the algorithm should deliver accurate results, and lastly, reliance on centralized computational resources should be minimized.

The significant contribution of this thesis lies in two new distributed machine learning algorithms, specifically adapted for wireless sensor network implementation. The first algorithm involves a two-layer classification scheme, with the primary layer executed on sensor nodes utilizing any classifier type (J48 decision trees were used for testing). The outcomes are then passed on to a central, secondary layer classifier which uses a weighted voting approach. The second algorithm is a Kohonen neural network-based clustering algorithm, custom-made to parse data from sensor nodes in wireless sensor networks. This data includes information about the location and properties of a sensed event. Accordingly, the suggested Kohonen neural network has two layers: one for clustering location data, the other for event type data.

Both proposed algorithms have proven to be energy efficient, while their accuracy has been confirmed through computational simulations. In summary, the algorithms are highly applicable to a variety of practical scenarios, indicating that machine learning techniques are a promising approach to sustaining substantial wireless sensor networks.
