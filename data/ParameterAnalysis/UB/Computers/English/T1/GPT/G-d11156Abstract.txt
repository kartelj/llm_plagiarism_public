This study aims to highlight and expound upon the potential to enhance decision-making processes in the selection of the most economical bidder in public e-procurement by establishing predetermined criteria for the buyer. Despite the simplicity of the selection process in scenarios with fewer bidders and clearly defined quantitative criteria, real-life situations often involve a large number of bidders, necessitating a selection based both on qualitative and quantitative criteria. 

The primary hypothesis of this thesis, verified throughout the doctoral research, posits that the incorporation of multi-criteria decision-making methods and fuzzy set theory can enhance the selection of the most financially viable bidder in situations that require the utilization of both qualitative and quantitative criteria simultaneously. The defuzzification process, or the selection of a single output variable value, allows for the determination of values linked to the output variable that match the criteria weights within a fuzzy set. 

Additionally, the dissertation discusses a decision support system grounded in multi-criteria decision-making and fuzzy set theory. This system, a vital component of the public e-procurement web portal, promotes a cooperative work environment by virtually connecting buyers and suppliers in a unified e-procurement workspace.
