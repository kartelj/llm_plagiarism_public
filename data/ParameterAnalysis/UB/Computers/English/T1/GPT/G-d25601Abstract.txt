Current trends in computer design are dedicated to elevating the performance of computer systems to premium levels to accommodate the need for managing massive data. Emphasis is placed on the design of the processor, the principal component in data processing. However, advancements in processor performance projected by Moore's Law are experiencing a gradual decline due to the physical restrictions of semiconductor technology, making performance enhancement increasingly difficult. To compensate for this issue, various methods are employed with the aim to enhance performance without the need to raise power and transistor consumption. This thesis will look at asymmetric multi-core processors supporting transactional memory. 

Two novel methods have been suggested to boost the performance of these processors. The first technique aims to alleviate transaction congestion from high parallelism by moving transactions to a faster core. The transactions most responsible for congestion are chosen for migration. Running them on a quicker core decreases their propensity to conflict with other transactions, thus raising the likelihood of congestion avoidance. 

The second technique modifies the cache subsystem to cut cache access latency and false conflict risks, while reducing the number of transistors needed for cache implementation. This can be achieved by using cages that are small and uncomplicated. Detailed plans for the implementation of both techniques are provided. 

Prototypes of these methods were created using the Gem5 simulator, accurately modelling the processor's system. These prototypes were reviewed by simulating a wide array of applications using a standard benchmark set for transactional memory. The analysis of the simulation results provided insight on when and how the suggested techniques should be utilized.
