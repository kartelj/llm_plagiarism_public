The process of digital image compression and coding involves reducing the memory resources required for displaying, storing, and transmitting these images, leading to substantial savings when using compression techniques. Effective algorithms and infrastructure for compression and decompression are essential when real-time performance is necessary. Current high-ratio image compression methods are slow, requiring large amounts of high-bandwidth memory and complicated processors while also consuming more power. The processing time and memory capacity increase as the compression rate rises. In this PhD thesis, we tackled the problem of building a codec that is swift, minimizes memory resource requirements, and boasts a high compression ratio. We combined scientific methods to achieve this. We reduced memory requirements using optimized nonstationary filters, a novel two-dimensional subband transformation algorithm, and an efficient probability estimator realization. We enhanced the operation speed via an algorithm for probability estimation and direct image processing, which is not done in stages. We achieved high compression ratio by combining the subband transformer, quantizer, single-pass probability estimator, and entropy encoder. The hardware developed in this thesis passed the image compression system test with a network interface. It demonstrated that it's feasible to contain an entire color image encoder inside an affordable programmable logic device, without reliance on external memory parts.
