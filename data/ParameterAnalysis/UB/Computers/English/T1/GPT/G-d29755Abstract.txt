The field of cloud computing has experienced vast growth over the last ten years. This research analyzes different kinds of cloud settings and the services offered to customers. Numerous issues arise with cloud usage, and these create significant obstacles for users. Before the advent of the cloud, users and managers of relational databases faced many issues. Responsibilities such as updating software for cloud platform-related database services fell to the service provider, leading to a notable reduction in operational costs. However, with the increase in the number of relational databases and the higher abstraction level introduced by the cloud environment, service enhancement and query optimization problems intensified. In the cloud context, detailed service usage information is continuously gathered. This paper introduces a system that, using this data, enables users to comprehend relational database functions better and identify problem origins more easily. Following an in-depth review of related literature, the system is thoughtfully designed and developed, involving two types of statistical data models to ensure recall and precision, and an expert system for final decision making. The necessary infrastructure is built on a microservice architecture. The project team comprised several professionals with varied skills, and the system was carried out within the Microsoft Azure platform. Specific details of this implementation are also outlined. The system was thoroughly tested and evaluated using actual data workload from Azure SQL's relational database production environment over six months. The results indicated a substantial improvement in query execution performance. Customer feedback showed that the user experience had been markedly enhanced. In conclusion, the project is overviewed, recommendations for system enhancement are suggested, and the potential for applying a similar approach in scientific fields is discussed.
