In this research, a pioneering approach for recognizing student attention levels is proposed, leveraging both Internet of Things (IoT) and machine learning technology. The principal argument authenticated in this doctoral dissertation is that the usage of IoT within the educational realm can augment teaching efficacy. This enhancement is made possible through a system designed for student attention detection, which permits environmental parameter examination and processed results' demonstration. To garner extensive comprehension necessary for the execution of aforementioned operations, along with backing up the requisite for conducting the associated study, a comprehensive inspection of pertinent computer and social science researches has been undertaken. The examination embraces a comparative scrutiny of smart classroom podiums, symbolizing a conduit for the emergence and identification of these innovative algorithms within their immediate social contexts. A comprehensive review of sociological sciences, primarily social signals, is included to comprehend the backdrop of sociological processes being observed and grouped, and to finalize the research direction for the proposed system. Furthermore, the examination has outlined potential parameters and algorithms to be used, supplemented with a methodology breakdown for each research phase. This includes an analysis of system needs, necessary features for detection, and socio-cultural factors influencing these elements. Pattern classification utilises machine learning, requiring a classifier reliant on a specific dataset. A system simulation was conducted on a dataset not previously used for training, achieving an average accuracy rate of 92.2%. After simulation, the system was executed and its performance was assessed by aligning real-time student feedback with the system output during lectures. The system's average accuracy evaluated across three distinct student groups was 81.9%.
