The primary goal of this research is to develop and empirically test a model of retail customer loyalty in Serbia. This was preceded by a review of academic literature that discussed key factors influencing service customer loyalty, such as service quality, satisfaction, and perceived value. With 737 convenience-sampled customers from non-specialised, mainly food retail stores, the study used a structured survey and multivariate data analysis techniques, specifically SPSS 18 and LISREL 8.80 software packages. The analysis results unveiled a multi-dimensional service quality in the Serbian retail context. Four retail service quality dimensions were identified as employees' behavior and appearance, store atmospherics, customer communication, and store layout and assortment. Structural equation modeling revealed customer satisfaction to be the key predictor of loyalty, suplemented by perceived value which influenced loyalty both directly and through satisfaction. The research additionally found service quality to indirectly influence customer loyalty via satisfaction and perceived value, despite a lack of significant direct impact. Findings underscore the importance of improving customer satisfaction, perceived values and service quality to maintain a loyal customer base. Future studies should consider improving the service quality scale and measuring customer satisfaction and perceived value with a more representative Serbian retail customer sample, addressing the limitation of this study's convenience sample.
