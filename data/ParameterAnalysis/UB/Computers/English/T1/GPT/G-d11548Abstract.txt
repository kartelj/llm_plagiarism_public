The evolution of today's society largely hinges on superior telecommunication networks. To ensure the reliability of services used by end-users, it's crucial that these networks maintain high availability. Current backbone networks, usually comprised of a significant number of nodes, make it challenging to calculate deliberate availability due to the spiraling time required for algorithms that handle these calculations as the number of nodes and links increases. Hence, the use of estimation algorithms in the designing stage of these networks is highly practical as they aid in outlining the foundational conditions for the network's topology. 

The crux of this doctoral thesis is to propose a new methodology for the estimated calculation of the maximum availability of intricate telecommunication networks. To achieve maximum availability values, a network synthesis method has been crafted, starting with a basic chain network topology. The initial step toward determining maximum network availability is forming a ring structure and progressively adding individual links to the network topology, resulting in increasing overall availability. Each new link added ensures that each step maximizes availability concerning the quantity of nodes, links, and the individual availability of each link. 

The approximation capabilities are analysed through the maximum network availability function based on nodes, links, and individual link availability, facilitated by the results of the network synthesis method for maximum availability networks. It also calculates the limitations of network availability predicated on the approximation functions which stipulate the boundaries necessitated for link augmentation to achieve desired network availability. Research shows that for maximum network availability, all network nodes should have identical connectivity levels varying by at most, one. Following this guideline and keeping in view a predetermined cap on the number of network links, network designs can be accomplished in a few iterations to achieve the desired availability. 

This thesis also revealed that the approximation functions' runtime does not hinge on network size. This enables a vast number of calculations, therefore allowing the analysis of countless unique input parameter combinations. The approximation functions defined in this work have proven to be more precise than those previously published. Lastly, comparison with exact availability values shows that the approximation's relative error is substantially less than 1% for networks with link availability exceeding 0.75.
