Wireless mesh networks (WMNs) are emerging trends in wireless communication renowned for their flexibility, reliability, and superior performance compared to standard wireless local area networks. Given the surging demand for speedy and efficient data transfer, including multimedia transmission (voice and video), there are unique challenges in WMN design. These challenges involve enhancing throughput via the multi-channel multi-interface (MCMI) approach and maintaining high-quality service (QoS).

For optimal network outcomes, it is important to clearly specify the protocols and metrics for routing that help determine the best route between the source and destination node. WMNs, especially in complicated environments (from the perspective of radio coverage), such as indoors, are characterized by high signal dynamics. This dissertation offers routing metrics that can quickly adapt to changes in propagation conditions at each network link. 

The three newly proposed metrics - powerETX (Expected Transmission Count), powerWCETT (Weighted Cumulative Expected Transmission Time), and powerMIC (Metric of Interference and Channel-switching) - also encompass the signal level received as a parameter, in addition to those defined in the existing ETX, WCETT, and MIC metrics. Compared to existing metrics, the new ones offer superior data throughput and minimal end-to-end delay. Additionally, they can be implemented with no additional hardware and minimal software modifications. 

Noting that current channel assignment algorithms neglect QoS support in MCMI-WMNs and multimedia transmission may potentially experience intolerable delays, a fresh QoS-HMCP (QoS Hybrid Multi-Channel Protocol) is proposed in this dissertation. This protocol features QoS support through an EDCA (Enhanced Distributed Channel Access) mechanism and utilizes the advantages of the hybrid CA algorithm defined by HMCP for link layer protocol. Four unique QoS-HMCP protocol versions are suggested, each considering different channel switching criteria and medium competition procedures. 

Compared to the basic HMCP protocol, the proposed versions deliver superior user data throughput and viii protocol optimization and routing metrics for multi-channel wireless mesh networks delay. Implementing QoS support in the MCMI network has been proven to yield positive results. The best version of the QoS-HMCP protocol is concluded upon a thorough side-by-side comparison, considering factors like the maximum throughput with the lowest delay, traffic categories, and network conditions. This dissertation also contributes by offering an extensive, systematic review of existing routing protocols, channel assignment strategies, and routing metrics for multi-channel multi-interface WMNs.
