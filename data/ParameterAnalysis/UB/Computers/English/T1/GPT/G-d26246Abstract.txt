The rising prevalence of biometric technologies in today's society suggest their incorporation into everyday life. Each system, when employing biometric authentication, requires specific protocols based on its application scenario. To determine the right biometric mode and corresponding algorithm, the system's overall performance must be assessed - a process which is not always straightforward for both unimodal and multimodal systems. Even when open biometric databases are accessible for evaluation, the system needs adjusting to suit the testing procedure of the selected database. Evaluating a system that utilizes multiple biometric modes is even more complex due to the wide range of fusion algorithms available. This thesis proposes a unified multimodal biometric systems evaluation model to ease these challenges, seeing as there is no detailed model currently provided in related literature. The proposed model employs the MDA (Model Driven Architecture) paradigm and includes a metamodel of multimodal biometric system evaluation, which embodies a terminology framework used in this field. An experimental framework that tests multimodal biometric system functionality across varied usage cases has been built on this model. Results have shown that the implementation of the framework significantly speeds up the evaluation process. Additionally, a novel analytical procedure for optimizing the biometric system threshold, crafted around pre-specified system behavior, has also been introduced. A training tool, extrapolated from the framework's functionality, demonstrates how this platform can aid in the instruction of engineers studying biometrics, boosting their understanding and efficiency.
