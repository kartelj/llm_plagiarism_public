E-learning constitutes a multi-faceted platform incorporating remote learning, classes, and a variety of electronic classroom resources, along with solitary and cooperative learning methods, guidance, and interactive engagement. The rapid and major rise in users, services, and the educational content and resources needed, presents e-learning systems—run by educational bodies—with new optimization issues related to resource allocation. They also face the challenges of maintaining competitive dynamism and cost management of these platforms. These issues have resulted in escalating demands for the development and implementation of IT structures tailored for e-learning platforms. By capitalizing on contemporary communication and information technologies, the productivity, versatility, and economic efficiency of these platforms can be improved. The reliability, scalability, and cost-effectiveness potential of educational procedures can be augmented through the adoption of IT frameworks for e-learning, based on a current IT principle—Cloud Computing. Despite limited advancement in scientific backing for employing the Cloud Computing principle in designing the IT infrastructure of Serbian higher education, the strategic importance of this principle underscores the need for generating theoretical support for its optimized development and application. The aim of the doctoral study scrutinizes this aspect. It is focused on the outlining and advancement of strategies and actions of higher education bodies concerning the evolution of the IT structure models for e-learning, based on the Cloud Computing principle. The quest for novel methods to deliver services to students and research scholars presents major challenges to these educational institutions, particularly in the realms of digital identity and access control. The most substantial challenge is encouraging the swift adoption and execution of digital identity management systems. This demands a holistic approach addressing identities and their inter-relatedness. The next challenge is sustaining a system capable of utilizing the benefits of federated systems for managing digital identities. Therefore, developing such federated systems among educational bodies enables user, content, and service mobility. The doctoral thesis posits that the application of a developed IT framework model impacts the productivity and economic feasibility of e-learning systems. The empirical aspect of the doctoral thesis involves testing the suggested IT framework model for e-learning. The research was conducted in the E-Business Laboratory of the Faculty of Organizational Sciences, and the results validated the hypothesis. The implemented model of the IT platform allowed the e-learning system to be more efficient, flexible, and economical.
