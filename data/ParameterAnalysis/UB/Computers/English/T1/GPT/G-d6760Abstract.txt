This thesis explores the use of contemporary software engineering methods in open-source software development within the realm of intelligent systems. The primary findings are a comprehensive software framework model and advice for managing open-source projects in this particular domain. The framework model and project management recommendations were devised and thoroughly tested throughout the development of extra features for a chosen software framework for neural networks. The selected neural network framework is among the top open-source Java neural network frameworks. The suggested software development methodologies are also relevant in other intelligent system disciplines, offering solutions to unique challenges and necessities in this field. The majority of these challenges arise from the fact that this software is often intended for research purposes, should be practical, and should maintain a level of simplicity for ease of use and modification while being complex. The suggested development approaches deal with requirements specification, planning, design, implementation, and upkeep. They come in the form of proven and effective recommendations. Along with these theoretical and methodological aspects, this thesis contributes practically by introducing new features to a chosen intelligent systems framework, notably enhancing its practical use.
