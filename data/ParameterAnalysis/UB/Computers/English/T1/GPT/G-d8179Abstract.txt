This thesis explores the creation and use of an interoperable e-Business model of payment systems. Based on ontologies and the Resource-Event-Agent - REA (ISO 15944-4 2007), ontological object system structure. Inspirations for this study are drawn from globally accepted business standards in the financial industry. The study relies on knowledge and experiences acquired from the implementation of the Check Clearing and Direct Debit systems in Serbian banks. It focuses mainly on the practical application of such models in the Serbian local payment systems. The e-Business model interacts with diverse participant business systems, all with unique requirements. A main challenge encountered is the disparity in business processes, data and IT technologies. Therefore, significant resources are used in data transition from one system to another. Given the surge in electronic financial transactions, there is a need for more efficient and adaptable models of e-Business payment systems. Standardization of these models, as posited in this study, should lead to increased efficiency and interoperability in e-business. Each country's payment system consists of an array of banking procedures, payment instruments, and fund transfer systems which circulate money in the economy. Central Banks play a pivotal role in regulating monetary flow and maintaining oversight of payment systems, especially Real-Time Gross Settlement System – RTGS. This system links the banking systems and other financial institutions. Payment agents, processing houses among others are regulated by law and deal with processing and distribution of financial transactions. Payment systems as discussed in this paper have the potential to synchronize elements common to all systems. Finally, ontologies provide a clear understanding for both humans and computers. The ontological approach used in this study allows for uniformity and enrichment of the model design from the knowledge domain. ISO 15944-4:2007 to be considered in this study provides the ontological foundation for the concepts and relations included in the business transactions known as Resource-Event-Agent – REA ontology.
