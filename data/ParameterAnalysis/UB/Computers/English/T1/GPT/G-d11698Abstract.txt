Gamma scintillation cameras (GSC) are medical instruments used in the analysis of intravenously injected, ingested or inhaled radiopharmaceuticals, and their technological evolution has greatly influenced the construction, flexibility, speed, price, and expandability of these devices' systems for image capture, storage, and analysis. Despite the advent of digital GSCs in the 1980s, many nuclear medical facilities continue to rely on fully functional analog or semi-analog GSCs that feature integral mechanics and scintillation crystals — the heart of nuclear imaging. The best approach involves digitizing these GSCs and incorporating them with contemporary computer systems. This ensures prolonged use of older GSCs, postpones the need to purchase new equipment, allows for superior analysis of nuclear-medical studies in line with Evidence Based Medicine (EBM), and facilitates the testing and development of innovative analysis methods to enhance patient treatment, provided the system architecture is open. This doctoral thesis aims to develop a computer system – the GammaKey system – focused on providing functions like acquisition, storage, and image processing to semi-analog GSCs. This system, compatible with contemporary digital systems and featuring an open architecture, will allow for the development and clinical application of new diagnostic techniques. The GammaKey system meets key requirements and includes standard and advanced features for image and study processing, in addition to three unique features: EffSpleen, Submarine analysis, and SalivaryScan analysis. These features aid in predicting the efficacy of splenectomy, locating parathyroid tumors, and conducting a complete quantitative investigation of salivary glands function, respectively. Furthermore, the GammaKey system promotes continuity in both basic clinical practice and research, and allows for the validation of other applications. It has been implemented in daily clinical practice at two leading medical centers in Serbia and has been instrumental in the examination of over 30,000 patients.
