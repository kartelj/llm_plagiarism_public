As global operations become increasingly interconnected, the management of intellectual capital is playing a growing role. The strong, modern belief is that effective intellectual capital management is a crucial contributor to an organization's success. Intellectual capital is not merely a key resource but also the foundation of contemporary organizational operations. The importance of this concept began to be understood in the early 1920s and studying it can significantly boost an organization's market value relative to its book value. As opposed to depreciable tangible assets, the appropriate utilization of intellectual capital amplifies the value of an organization over time. Managers are tasked with identifying and leveraging opportunities and strengths in a rapidly changing environment while simultaneously minimizing or eliminating weaknesses. Only through this kind of strategic action can an organization grow and develop. 

The operational and strategic importance of intellectual capital cannot be overstated and as such, more and more organizations are beginning to take an active interest in its management. Intellectual capital can be thought of as an intangible asset that comprises human capital, structural capital, and relational capital. This includes not just the knowledge contained within the organization, but also the competences of staff, the organizational structure, business processes, intellectual property, and corporate culture. Both internal and external resources, including relationships with stakeholders like customers, suppliers, and distributors, also form a crucial part of intellectual capital. 

This type of capital includes elements that may not be reflected in formal financial statements, yet they are key to the creation of organizational value. The effective management of intellectual capital helps increase the value of the organization, with its qualitative dimensions being more imperative for adding value than merely quantitative ones. As a signal of future trends in a dynamically changing environment, intellectual capital is of utmost importance. 

This thesis aims to explore how organizations identify, evaluate, and report on intellectual capital. It includes both a literature review in the field of intellectual capital and a survey of previous studies related to its practical management within organizations. An empirical study conducted as part of the thesis discusses the concept of intellectual capital in Serbian organizations and its significance for financial reporting. The thesis confirms the hypothesis that having an adequate intellectual capital position is a top indicator of performance in today's world, ensuring the completeness of information. 

The ultimate conclusion emphasizes the necessity of valuing intellectual capital and presenting it in supplementary financial statements for a more accurate and reliable depiction of an organization's value. Traditional financial statements and quantitative indicators fail to capture this accurately, so the introduction of quantified non-financial elements or descriptive forms can bolster a clearer understanding of the value and potential of the organization as a whole.
