The thesis aims to merge the study of information systems and operational research by employing various soft computing and optimization techniques within a service-oriented framework for modern software development. Service-orientation, a novel method to develop distributed applications and automate business processes, is rapidly gaining popularity. It's premised on the flexible and dynamic composition of distributed applications by incorporating independently developed software components or services. These services are independent of particular business processes and can be reapplied in different contexts. 

Web services, in particular, are prominent in implementing service-oriented software solutions, thanks to their internet accessibility and adherence to globally accepted standards. With a multitude of web services with similar functionalities, selection becomes complex, with Quality of Service (QoS) attributes playing an essential role. The complexity is further compounded when a set of services, instead of a single one, is required to deliver desired functionality, leading to service composition. 

This compositional approach enhances application development by reusing existing services, saving costs, and reducing effort. To ensure optimal service selection within a composition, functional requirements and relevant QoS requirements must be met. Calculating the overall QoS for a web service composition presents a challenge as QoS values must be aggregated, and the method of aggregation depends on the chosen QoS attributes and the composition's structure. There are often specific constraints on the required QoS levels of the composition.

There are shortcomings in existing approaches, such as the dependence on quantitative QoS attributes, the prerequisite of linear functions for QoS values aggregation, and the necessity of QoS values normalization. Two solutions are proposed: application of Boolean consistent fuzzy logic for expressing complex preferences, and modeling problems as a discrete multi-objective fractional programming problem (MOFP) when criteria are heterogeneous. Among other proposals, the Analytical Hierarchy Process method (AHP) combined with Boolean consistent fuzzy logic is suggested for service selection based on logical demands related to QoS criteria. 

Different methods for service selection within a composition are also proposed, including adapting an existing method for solving the MOFP problem, and applying heuristic methods for larger, time-critical tasks. Validation of these methods is supported by a custom-developed software solution. The paper concludes with a discussion on the broader applications of the proposed methods.
