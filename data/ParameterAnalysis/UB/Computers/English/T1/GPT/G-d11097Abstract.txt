The concept of market positioning involves active participation in the creation of tourist offers or services, allowing tourism companies to secure the best market position. The original approach to positioning in the 1970s concentrated on the promotional activities of a single company, with marketers tasked with securing a unique position in consumers' minds through targeted marketing efforts. Even though many authors have given their insight and definition to the concept of positioning over time, no universal market coordinates that guarantee an optimal, lasting, and sustainable market position have been established. As the notion of positioning has evolved over the years, so have the methods of attaining positioning goals; from multi-dimensional scaling to discriminant, factor, and conjoint analysis. This dissertation suggests a novel solution to market positioning difficulties by using a combined application of statistical and operational research models. This will allow marketing managers to respond timely and formulate market strategies amidst competition. The proposed model provides a way to predict possible competitive moves and strike a balance between focusing on consumer preferences and the competition, leading to a better formulation of optimal market strategies. Conjoint analysis is used to determine consumer preferences, as it provides an understanding of market heterogeneity and a means for ascertaining the ideal features of a tourist product. If preferences are diverse, cluster analysis can be used to segment the tourist market. However, it's crucial to consider all facets of potential market interactions given the inherently competitive nature of the modern market. This so-called market conflict, though seemingly chaotic, hides rational behaviours that can be modelled using game theory concepts. The combined application of the three models (conjoint analysis, cluster analysis, and game theory) yields a superior method for identifying the optimal market position than previous models which separate these tools. The proposal and efficacy of this new market positioning model are demonstrated through its application on real-life gastronomy events. The value of the proposed model lies in its adaptability, flexibility, and capacity for dynamic decision-making. As market conditions change, such as the launch of a new product, enhancement of an existing product or shifts in consumer preferences, the model can be reused to achieve an optimal market position. This model suggests potential for widespread application across all tourism sectors and broader service sectors, potentially serving as a general paradigm for pinpointing the optimal market position.
