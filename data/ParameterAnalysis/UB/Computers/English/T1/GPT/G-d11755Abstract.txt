Despite significant advancements in artificial intelligence, the human brain still surpasses it in understanding and handling partially known facts. One area where this becomes conspicuous is in question answering, particularly when providing answers that are not explicitly present in the text corpus. The human expert has advantages such as explaining, combining complex answers, and abstract reasoning. Intelligent Question Routing Systems (IQRS) function as a medium for knowledge exchange in any expertise field that requires intense user communication. Advantages of implementing such systems include reducing unnecessary engagement of experts and increased quality of service from the system owners given that questions are answered by the most suitable individuals.

This dissertation presents a methodology for designing IQRS systems, with a review of existing research focusing on the IQRS process phases. An original paradigm for presentation is introduced, generalizing the essence of various sighted approaches. This includes three primary processing stages related to system implementation: question analysis, question forwarding, and usersâ€™ knowledge profiling.

It proposes new solutions after identifying issues. The rest of the dissertation outlines an IQRS prototype, implementing proposed ideas. The question analysis module allows for question visualization offering a clear depiction of specific concept relationships and their significance within the question. It also combines automatic text processing and manual result corrections for increased output accuracy.

An analysis and discussion of determining semantic similarity between two texts are provided, focusing on those applicable to languages with limited electronic linguistic resources like Serbian. Consequently, a new algorithm named LInSTSS is proposed, factoring in word specificity in calculating semantic similarity.

Additionally, a Serbian paraphrase corpus is constructed and evaluated, revealing the algorithm provided better results compared to existing solutions. This evaluation is used to fine-tune algorithm parameters and inform the design of calculating module semantic similarity between a question and user profile.

The proposed P2Q algorithm in the question forwarding phase assesses the highest similarity between question concepts and the user profile. Web portal analysis identifies a suitable portal for creating a questions and answers corpus, which is used to test the initial hypothesis and evaluate the overall system performances.

Finally, the dissertation contributes to software system analysis and synthesis, aiming for intelligent question routing. It concludes that properly assigned weights can enhance system performances, while improper assignment significantly reduces the same. It emphasizes the necessity to consider both best answered questions and those expressing interest in profiling user competency.
