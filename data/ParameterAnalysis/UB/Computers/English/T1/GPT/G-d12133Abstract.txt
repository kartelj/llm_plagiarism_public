Determining the effort required to implement a software system is one of the most challenging yet crucial tasks in software engineering. Often, the projected effort forms a decisive factor in determining the onset, constraints, and eventual success or failure of a project. In reality, these estimates are usually formulated from incomplete requirements using a range of heuristics, assumptions, and experienced insights, where the best possible approximations are sought within a limited timeframe. Despite substantial progress in diverse areas of software engineering over recent decades, most effort estimation methods rely largely on the subjective assessments of the project teams or field experts. Consequently, miscalculations in effort estimates often exceed expectations. Global data indicates that only a third of software projects succeed, another third exceed budget and time limitations, while the rest fail. Misestimated efforts are a predominant cause for these dismal statistics. This thesis seeks to scrutinize existing effort estimation procedures and to propose innovative methods to enhance effort approximation accuracy. The cornerstone of this thesis outlines the adoption of new models and techniques designed to augment current effort estimation practices. It will present suggestions for enhancing existing evaluation methods, along with tangible results achievable through applying these enhancements to actual software projects. The enhancements focus primarily on identifying those project parameters that exert maximum influence on the effort, as well as establishing associations between these parameters and the effort.
