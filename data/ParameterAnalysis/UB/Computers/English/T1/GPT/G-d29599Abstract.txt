This doctoral thesis primarily focuses on assessing the potential uses of virtual worlds in the realms of research and education. It delves into two key aspects: the application of autonomous agents and agent theory within the scope of virtual worlds, and the utilization of virtual worlds in educational scenarios, with particular concentration on virtual laboratories. The dissertation commences with an explanation of basic terminology relevant to the topic. It subsequently provides an exhaustive analysis concerning the function of agents within virtual worlds, incorporating an exploration of the techniques that determine the behavior of these agents. The dissertation also presents the creation of an educational system based on virtual gamified elements, specifically tailored for agents, and provides an in-depth description of it. This culminates in an evaluation and analysis of virtual laboratories' concept in the domains of Science, Technology, and Engineering, and an assessment of existing solutions based on criteria outlined in the dissertation.
