The selection of a routing strategy in a packet network significantly influences the reliability and overall quality of data transmission. It also affects the utilization of various network resources, and ill-informed routing decisions can create network bottlenecks and curtail throughput. Factors such as network latency and cost also hinge on the chosen routing strategy. To pinpoint the optimum routing strategy for a particular network and projected traffic, routing optimization is employed. This process aims to achieve the most favorable value for the selected network performance metric. Depending on the problem in question, optimization can aim to boost network throughput, reduce network cost, minimize latency, etc.

In this study, we delve into the issues of maximizing network throughput and reducing network cost. Our focus will primarily be on non-blocking networks that ensure service for all users who generate and receive traffic within specific boundaries, irrespective of the distribution of current traffic in the network. We will suggest a new routing strategy based on load balancing and shortest path routing, which we will designate as load balanced routing (LBR). This proposed routing protocol can be polished using linear programming to either reduce cost or ramp up network throughput.

The suggested routing strategy can be easily implemented in reality. More specifically, shortest path routing is extensively employed, making the proposed routing a modification that can be executed with relative ease. The dimensions of the linear program are feasible, as is the time required for optimization. The proposed routing guarantees service for more users than the standard shortest path routing and the costs associated with servicing a specific number of users are less when the proposed routing is used instead of the shortest path routing.

Initially, we will present the proposed load balanced routing and the linear program used in its optimization. Subsequently, we will evaluate the performance of the proposed routing strategy, contrasting it with shortest path routing. Two specific scenarios will be targeted: firstly, we will tweak the load balanced routing to accomplish maximum network throughput and demonstrate its potential for significant enhancement of guaranteed network throughput compared to the regular shortest path routing; secondly, we will fine-tune the load balanced routing to achieve the lowest cost network supporting given user demands, demonstrating that the network cost is less with load balanced routing than with shortest path routing.

We will perform analyses for both typical and realistic network topologies, as well as for networks that mandate service reliability in the event of a single resource (link or router) failure. We will demonstrate that the performance of the proposed load balanced routing trumps that of shortest path routing in all these contexts.
