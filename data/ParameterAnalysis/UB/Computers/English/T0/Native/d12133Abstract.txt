Estimating the effort required to implement the software system is one of the most difficult, but also the most important tasks in software engineering. Effort estimate is often a key factor that will indicate whether the project will begin, under which restrictions will be implemented and would it be successfully completed and used. The reality is that the estimates are often made based on the incomplete requirements using various heuristics, assumptions and experience, where best possible estimates are required in a limited timeframe. Besides significant advances in various domains of software engineering in recent decades, effort estimation methods are mostly based on the subjective assessment by the project teams or experts in a certain field, with the effort estimate errors often higher than the expected. Global statistics show that only one third of software projects is successfully concluded, one third is not finished within the budget and deadlines, while the rest of projects fail. One of the main causes for these results are inaccurate effort estimates. The aim of this thesis is to analyze the existing effort estimation methods and propose new methods that can improve effort estimation. The basic idea that will be presented in the thesis is the usage of new models and techniques that will improve the existing effort estimation methods. In the thesis, proposals for the improvement of existing assessment methods and concrete results that can be obtained using these solutions to real software projects will be presented. Improvements are confined to the identification of project parameters describing projects that influence the effort the most, as well as determining dependencies between the parameters and the effort.
