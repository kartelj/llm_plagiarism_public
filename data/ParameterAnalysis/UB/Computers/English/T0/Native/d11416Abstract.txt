Three-dimensional(3D)videosarebecomingincreasingly present in wireland and wireless networks, and due to the high data content they present significant load in the network. This impact of 3D video on network traffic causes a need of improving means to handle this type of data. Subject of this thesis is fractal and multifractal characterization of 3D video formats with the main goals to show that 3D video has fractal and multifractal properties,todescribethem,tocomparethesepropertiesfordifferent3Dformats,for possibleapplicationsintrafficmodelingof3Dvideoformatsandforthedevelopment ofimprovedtransporttechniquesforsmoothingandstatisticalmultiplexingofvideo. Algorithms and software realizations for mathematical methods in the area of complex systems and chaos were developed in Matlab and Python, for determina- tionoffractalproperties(theaggregatedvariancemethod, theR/Sstatisticmethod, and the multiscale method) and multifractal properties (the method of moments for multifractal spectra and estimation of the generalized dimensions and the histogram method for multifractal spectra and inverse multifractal analysis). Based on the ob- tained results, fractal and multifractal properties of 3D video formats are confirmed, their comparison is performed, for various 3D video formats, video structures, frame types, values of the encoder quantization parameters, aggregation of the frames, and streaming method of video.
