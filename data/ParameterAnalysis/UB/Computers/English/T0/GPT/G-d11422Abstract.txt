The number of internet-connected digital multimedia devices in contemporary households, including smartphones, tablets, digital TVs, and set-top boxes, has significantly risen in recent years. This availability and software customization capability simplifies the development of distributed applications. Applications created in an integrated environment can provide unique human-computer interaction (HCI) scenarios compared to single-device scenarios. However, a study of existing HCI systems that merge digital TV and mobile devices in a living room setting revealed that these systems are ad-hoc, lack flexibility, and are unable to explore various HCI scenario combinations. 

This dissertation introduces the SHARP development framework, which facilitates the efficient creation of distributed systems in an integrated environment comprising digital TV, mobile devices, and the internet. The framework aims to help HCI researchers develop innovative applications that offer diverse HCI scenario combinations in the living room with less effort. 

The dissertation begins with a survey of existing HCI systems for living room environments, identifying common characteristics and potential HCI scenarios for integrated environment applications. These include multi-screen content sharing, mobile device control of central screen actions, motion detection, supplemental sensory feedback, parallel interaction with passive TV viewing, user experience enhancement with access to various information services, and interaction between co-located and non-co-located individuals. 

After identifying these scenarios, the SHARP development framework is proposed, with details on its design and implementation. The framework's design enables developers to create applications that combine these identified scenarios. The field of game development was chosen to validate the framework's benefits, as game applications are popular and profitable. Five games were developed using the SHARP framework to demonstrate its flexibility and the potential for novel applications offering new scenario combinations. 

The acceptance of the identified scenarios was evaluated by examining the experiences of 59 test users interacting with the developed game applications. The SHARP framework was validated by comparing the size, complexity, and responsiveness of applications developed with and without the framework. The results indicate that the framework reduces both development and testing effort by shifting complex game implementation logic to reusable framework components. Although the framework's use slightly increased response time, all versions remained within acceptable performance limits.
