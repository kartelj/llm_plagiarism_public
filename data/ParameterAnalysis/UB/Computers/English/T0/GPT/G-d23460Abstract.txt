Content created by users on web forums is more frequently added than it is removed or altered, making its targeting during incremental crawling distinct from that of website page crawling. When new content is added to a forum, it can cause existing content to be relocated to new or existing pages. Incremental forum crawling is a complex task, as neglecting the manner in which content is displayed, distributed, and organized can result in the transfer of posts that have already been indexed in previous crawl cycles. Additionally, there is a broad range of forum technologies that offer various navigational paths to the most recent posts and different methods of displaying and organizing user-generated content.

This paper introduces the Structure-driven Incremental Forum crawler (SInFo), a system that specializes in targeting the most recent content in incremental forum crawling using advanced optimization techniques and machine learning. The primary objective of the system presented is to bypass content that has already been indexed in new crawl cycles, regardless of its technology. To accomplish this, the following web forum features were utilized: (1) the sorting method on the index and thread pages, and (2) the available navigational paths between the pages offered by the current web forum technology. Since the date of content creation is crucial in determining the type of sort, detecting and normalizing it is not a simple task. Machine learning models were employed for this task, as the generated dates can be in various formats and languages. On the other hand, the detection of navigational paths is accomplished by interpreting the URL format and scanning the targeted pages.

The proposed methods and techniques have proven to be effective in targeting pages with the most recent content, resulting in a minimal number of duplicate content downloads and maximizing the use of the navigational structure and paths of the current forum technology. The experiments were conducted on a wide variety of existing popular forum technologies as well as on individual stand-alone forum technologies. SInFo has shown high precision and a minimal number of duplicate content transfers in each new crawl cycle. Most of the duplicates encountered by the proposed system are from pages that had to be visited to accurately determine the navigational path or find the appropriate URL. Furthermore, despite their complexity, machine learning models performed well during crawling and demonstrated high accuracy in date detection and normalization, achieving an F1-measure of 99%.
