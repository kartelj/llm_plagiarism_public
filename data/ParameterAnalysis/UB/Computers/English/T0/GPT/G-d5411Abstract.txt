This dissertation explores the discovery of fuzzy functional dependencies within fuzzy relational database models. The aim is to examine recent findings in this field, and to create a unique algorithm for identifying dependencies between attributes in fuzzy relations, based on fuzzy implication in fuzzy logic. The issue of analyzing fuzzy functional dependencies in fuzzy relational database models is not a new one, with numerous papers and authors addressing this topic over the past twenty years. However, a literature review revealed a lack of algorithms capable of identifying attribute relationships in relational schemas. This gap prompted the development of our methodology for analyzing fuzzy functional dependencies across a given set of attributes. This problem, while not new, presents both theoretical and practical challenges. The implementation of logical database models, as informed by previous theory, and their integration into other areas and fields, are key objectives of this paper. The initial hypothesis was that fuzzy set theory and a specific fragment of fuzzy logic could provide an ideal solution when database managers are unable to clearly define the relationships between data and attributes within a relation. In the realm of artificial intelligence, fuzzy sets and fuzzy logic are examined in the context of fuzzy relational database design within intelligent systems, as they offer powerful tools for handling and representing imprecise and uncertain information. The identification of potential dependencies between attributes in fuzzy relations is a data mining technique related to the discovery of hidden and useful knowledge for decision-making. This dissertation introduces a new technique for identifying existing dependencies between pairs of tuples using various fuzzy implications, as described by the author. Fuzzy implications that meet established acceptance criteria are used to estimate the linguistic strength θ when a fuzzy functional dependency X → Y is satisfied. To demonstrate the proposed methodology and verify the research, we conducted an experiment on real data using two different models: a fuzzy database model based on proximity relation, and a fuzzy database model with possibility distribution. The discovery of potential dependencies between attributes of the observed fuzzy relation represents the uncovering of hidden and useful knowledge, or a data mining technique. To identify a fuzzy functional dependency within the corresponding fuzzy model, the following steps are necessary: data preparation for analysis, finding subrelations on the observed attributes with potentially hidden fuzzy functional dependencies, associating fuzzy functional dependencies with corresponding fuzzy implications, and interpreting search results to obtain the final set of fuzzy dependencies. From a practical standpoint, it is necessary to conduct an efficiency analysis when searching for fuzzy functional dependencies within fuzzy database models using the proposed methodology. The main potential drawback is the total number of transactions (possible pairs of tuples with associated values) that need to be computed, which can be costly for large databases. However, this PhD thesis proposes and demonstrates that it is possible to increase the efficiency of the algorithm and reduce the number of computed transactions. It should be noted that the nature of the problem at hand determines the efficiency of the algorithm. Some databases may not require compression, while others, particularly large databases, may benefit from various reduction techniques such as data summarization based on fuzzification, cluster formation, granulation, and representing multiple similar tuples with a single representative tuple. In general, our research demonstrates how to extract intelligent information from fuzzy relational databases. To identify potential relations between attributes of a fuzzy relation, the data must first be prepared for analysis. This involves creating a table with pairs of tuples and conformance values on all attributes of the original relation. The next step is to find sub-relations where the criteria for the existence of fuzzy dependencies are met. The third step is to associate fuzzy functional dependencies with corresponding fuzzy implications. Finally, the results of the previous steps are interpreted to obtain the final set of fuzzy functional dependencies. The most significant contribution of this dissertation is the characterization of fuzzy set theory and fuzzy implications in the context of developing tools and algorithms that facilitate the identification of relations between attributes in the observed relational schemes. This paper represents an empirical study and a "proof-of-concept", without developed commercial software. We also discuss certain practical cases where this methodology may be applicable. Our experiments suggest that the results provided by the algorithm are acceptable. Future work will involve applying this research in different scenarios and applications that involve this methodology, such as estimating null values in relational databases, text mining, and extracting dependencies from practical knowledge databases.
