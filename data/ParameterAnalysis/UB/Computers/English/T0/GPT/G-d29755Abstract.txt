The field of cloud computing has seen exponential growth over the past ten years. This study assesses a variety of cloud environments and services offered to customers. Numerous issues have been identified in cloud usage, posing significant challenges for users. Even before the advent of the cloud, users and administrators of relational databases faced various problems. Issues like software updates for relational database services on a cloud platform became the service provider's responsibility, leading to a significant reduction in operational costs. However, service improvement and query optimization issues escalated due to the increased number of relational databases and the higher level of abstraction brought about by the cloud environment. Detailed service usage information is continuously gathered in the cloud environment. A system is proposed that uses this data to help users understand how the relational database operates and identify problem sources more easily. After a thorough review of related work, the system is meticulously designed and developed. It incorporates two types of statistical data models for recall and precision, and an expert system for final decision-making. The system is built on a microservice architecture and implemented on the Microsoft Azure platform. The project team comprised several members with diverse skills. Specific implementation details are also shared. The system was thoroughly tested and evaluated using real data workload from the Azure SQL relational database's production environment over six months. The results indicated a significant improvement in query execution performance. Customer feedback revealed a substantial enhancement in user experience. The conclusion provides a project overview, suggests system improvement ideas, and discusses how similar approaches can be applied in scientific fields.
