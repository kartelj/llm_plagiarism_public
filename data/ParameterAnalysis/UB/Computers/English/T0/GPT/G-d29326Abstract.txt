The creation and operation of modern network environments, along with their interaction with other technologically diverse concepts, relies on the use and compatibility of various heterogeneous technologies. These intricate network environments are consistently faced with operational challenges, with the security and safety of services and data being a top priority. The growing number of users and the rapid development of new applications demanding high bandwidth have set new standards for security systems. These systems are based on monitoring and understanding network traffic characteristics effectively. 

Given the escalating development in cyberattacks, constant changes in network traffic, and increased diversity of technologies and devices used, developing solutions for anomaly and attack detection has become crucial. Despite numerous studies on network traffic flow analysis for performance and security monitoring, only a few focus on generating network traffic behavior profiles or specific communication patterns. Network behavior analysis, therefore, depends on understanding normal or acceptable behavior patterns to effectively detect unusual or anomalous behavior patterns. 

This approach, unlike intrusion detection systems based on packet payload or signature, is extremely useful for identifying unknown threats, zero-day attacks, and suspicious behavior, as well as improving overall network performance. This dissertation proposes a new method for detecting attacks and anomalies, based on profiling network traffic using only IP addresses and port numbers collected via the NetFlow protocol. 

The proposed solution involves specific preprocessing of network traffic flows by applying entropy calculation over certain traffic flow attributes. Additional attributes are then calculated using aggregation techniques, reflecting the communication activity of participants in the observed time interval or epoch. These attributes are further transformed to form several characteristic signatures, describing the network traffic profiles. 

The dissertation provides a thorough overview of the issues in detecting and identifying anomalies and attacks in modern network environments and offers a systematic approach to addressing these issues. This includes preprocessing network traffic flows, calculating attribute values' entropy, aggregating them, generating specific network traffic profile signatures, and applying a modified hierarchical agglomerative clustering (HAC) algorithm. 

The main goal is to enable quick and efficient processing of real network environment data, even when dealing with unlabeled, incomplete, and varying flow lengths. The proposed solution assumes that each data flow includes certain information and volumetric attributes, with special aggregation techniques generating additional behavioral attributes. Like entropy-based techniques, aggregation is applied over each data flow, with preprocessed attributes interpreted as a separate communication flow signature. The dissertation aims to find a method that enhances entropy-based techniques by applying different machine learning algorithms, proposing two new approaches.
