This study introduces a unique approach to monitor students' attention using the Internet of Things (IoT) and machine learning algorithms. The primary hypothesis validated in this doctoral thesis is that the application of IoT in education can enhance teaching effectiveness. This is achieved by implementing a system that detects students' attention, allowing for the analysis of environmental parameters and the presentation of processed results. To further understand and justify the need for this study, a review of relevant computer and social science research was conducted. This review included a comparative analysis of smart classroom platforms, which serve as a conduit for these new algorithms to emerge and identify sociological contexts at the time of their appearance. The importance of sociological sciences is emphasized as they provide insight into the sociological processes being monitored and classified. The review also outlined potential parameters and algorithms that could be used, along with a description of the methodology for all research phases. The system's requirements were analyzed, and key features for detection were identified, along with the sociological factors that influence these features. Pattern classification was achieved using a machine learning method that required a classifier based on a specific dataset. Prior to implementation, the system was simulated on a dataset not used in the training process, achieving an average accuracy of 92.2%. Following the simulation, the system was implemented and its performance evaluated by comparing real-time student feedback with the system output during lectures. The system's average accuracy, evaluated across three different student groups, was 81.9%.
