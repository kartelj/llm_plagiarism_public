The research problem in this dissertation pertains to the overwhelming amount of data and the scarcity of information in business reporting systems. Despite being filled with charts and tables, these reports primarily consist of data and minimal information. Users of these reports must manually interpret the data, which can lead to missed crucial information due to factors such as data overload, fatigue, lack of focus, insufficient knowledge or experience, subjectivity, or even malice. This paper suggests automating the process of converting data into information. The suggested method is grounded in the principle that data transforms into information when it is given meaning or interpretation. Additionally, relevant knowledge is necessary to derive meaning from data. The proposed implementation of this method involves using expert system methods, techniques, and technologies to automate the interpretation of key performance indicators. Specifically, classes will present declarative knowledge, while rules and fuzzy theory will present procedural knowledge. The information can be derived using forward chaining and fuzzy inference, and then converted into natural language-like sentences using canned text. After examining the current state of business intelligence systems and expert systems, the proposed method is explained in detail theoretically. This is followed by a discussion on the potential pros and cons of the solution, and then the implementation plan. The approach is demonstrated with a prototype - PT application (PT - Enterprise Profit Interpretation Tutor), which enables the testing and proving of the hypotheses. The application's reports contain data (in graphical and tabular form) and information (in natural language-like sentences). The evaluation involved a study with students using PT as a teaching aid. The results indicate that students find PT useful and relatively easy to use. The report explanations are deemed useful and easy to comprehend, but could be more extensive. The majority of students surveyed believe that using the PT application somewhat enhances their knowledge and offers a quicker and more engaging way to master profit interpretation. This paper also presents a comparative analysis of explanation facilities in modern tools for developing expert systems and business rules. The JEFF explanation facility, created for the prototype to function, is presented and evaluated. The evaluation was twofold, assessing whether objectives were met and how JEFF compares to similar tools. It was found that nearly all objectives were met and that JEFF is almost on par with the professional tool it was compared to. In summary, the hypotheses are proven, indicating that the proposed methods and techniques can be successfully used for information creation. However, the proposed approach was not tested in a business environment. The prototype proves the feasibility of the approach, but its effectiveness was only evaluated as a teaching aid for students, not as a tool to assist managers in data interpretation. If the proposed approach were to be implemented in practice, it would be necessary to develop applications tailored to managers' needs that could function in a business environment.
