This thesis introduces a new system for visually representing cryptographic algorithms, known as CryptOgraphic Algorithms visuaL simulAtion (COALA). The primary aim of COALA is to assist newcomers to data security in comprehending the foundational cryptographic algorithms, which underpin more complex topics. The University of Belgrade's School of Electrical Engineering offers a Data Security course that covers cryptographic algorithms, security protocols, applications, and system security. It was observed that students often struggle with the cryptographic algorithms section, negatively affecting their overall exam performance. The introduction of a visual representation system for cryptographic algorithms in lab exercises was identified as a potential solution after analyzing the situation. Such systems are commonly used in computer engineering and information systems courses that teach software-related areas. Before developing COALA, existing solutions were analyzed to determine if a suitable system already existed and to define the necessary characteristics for an effective educational tool. Despite the abundance of algorithm visual representation systems (AV systems), few cater to cryptographic algorithms, and none fully meet the Data Security course's needs. A development methodology for such a system was proposed after categorizing existing AV systems, particularly those suitable for cryptographic algorithms. The most efficient use of COALA in the educational process was determined through literature analysis on eLearning tools. COALA allows for a detailed analysis of all cryptographic algorithms taught in lectures and problem classes, presenting all execution details of supported algorithms. It works with real-world algorithm parameter lengths, and all input parameters are configurable for easy demonstration of algorithm execution on various examples. The thesis includes overviews of the eLearning tools field, AV systems, and systems for visual representation of cryptographic algorithms. It also describes the cryptographic algorithms supported by COALA, which include five types: substitution, transposition, production, symmetric block, and public-key algorithms. The visual representation used in COALA is explained in detail, and the functional description and software implementation details of COALA are provided.
