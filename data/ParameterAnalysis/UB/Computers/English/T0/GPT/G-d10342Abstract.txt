Economies that rely heavily on knowledge are greatly dependent on the adoption and application of this knowledge to enhance their competitiveness. In such settings, vast amounts of pertinent knowledge can be found both within and outside organizations. The ever-changing global market compels organizations to utilize their knowledge flows to meet their needs and gain a competitive edge. Organizations aim for constant knowledge accumulation to enhance their business solutions and products, create new market opportunities, fortify their knowledge base, and forecast market trends. This increases the significance of the concept of absorptive capacity, which pertains to an organization's ability to acquire, assimilate, transform, and apply knowledge. While numerous studies have dissected absorptive capacity into its components and analyzed their characteristics, this research investigates the relationships between the dimensions and components of absorptive capacity, as well as the intensity of their impact on the absorptive capacity level of organizations in technology and knowledge-intensive industries. To this end, a management model for absorptive capacity that tracks knowledge flow from acquisition to application has been developed and implemented. This model is predicated on the division of absorptive capacity into dimensions and components. The outcomes of the model's application were scrutinized to assess the potential impact of absorptive capacity on an organization's competitive strength, which is the primary hypothesis of this doctoral dissertation. The research employed both quantitative and qualitative methodologies based on a survey. The collected data were analyzed using the absorptive capacity evaluation model, with discriminant analysis serving as the statistical method. The research findings indicate that it is feasible to analyze the level of absorptive capacity using the model's indicators, and that the most influential determinant of absorptive capacity is the availability of relevant knowledge. The impact of absorptive capacity on an organization's competitiveness was determined using the principles of the Balanced Scorecard model. The research results suggest that it is possible to manage the determinants of absorptive capacity within the given framework. These findings will enhance understanding of the absorptive capacity framework in sectors that heavily rely on the adoption and use of knowledge for further development, which is crucial for the competitiveness of knowledge-based economies, including the Republic of Serbia, given its strategic orientation. The developed model can offer management support in the areas of organizational learning, and knowledge and innovation management.
