Typically, statistical methods for natural language processing require a significant amount of labeled data and various auxiliary language tools, which can limit their use in settings with limited resources. This dissertation introduces a method for creating statistical solutions for semantic processing of natural languages that have limited resources. These languages not only have limited existing resources, but also limited capabilities for creating new datasets, tools, and algorithms. The proposed method focuses on short texts due to their commonality in digital communication and the increased complexity of their semantic processing. The method covers all stages of creating statistical solutions, from collecting text, to annotating data, to creating, training, and evaluating machine learning models. The method's application is demonstrated in detail on two semantic tasks â€“ sentiment analysis and semantic textual similarity. The Serbian language is used as an example of a language with limited resources, but the method can also be applied to other languages in this category. Besides the general method, this dissertation's contributions include the creation of a new, flexible short-text sentiment annotation system, a new annotation cost-effectiveness metric, and several new semantic textual similarity models. The dissertation's results also include the creation of the first publicly available annotated datasets of short texts in Serbian for sentiment analysis and semantic textual similarity tasks, the development and evaluation of numerous models on these tasks, and the first comparative evaluation of multiple morphological normalization tools on short texts in Serbian.
