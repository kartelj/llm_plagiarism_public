A literature review revealed multiple perspectives on the notion of performance. The common thread among these perspectives is the measurable performance of behaviors or actions that contribute to the attainment of organizational goals. Performance indicators are crucial management tools that guide management towards beneficial long-term strategies and effective short-term decision-making. These indicators, based on current and past performance, are used to predict future business operations. They are inseparable from performance indicators of other business functions. Performance management is a superior management mechanism that integrates other systems and forms the foundation for appropriate managerial decision-making. This thesis aims to explore the potential interconnection between an organization's financial and business performance. The organization's success is gauged by a widely accepted approach. A review of secondary sources and empirical research conducted on the most successful companies over a five-year period confirmed the basic hypothesis of a correlation between business success and financial performance indicators. The findings indicate that most successful companies' financial performance indicators accumulate at specific intervals. The data's statistical analysis revealed a clear correlation between certain financial performance indicators and the company's age and industry. Consequently, empirical research discovered a statistically significant difference between the values of certain financial performance indicators in more successful and less successful organizations. Based on the research data analysis, a new theoretically established management concept based on financial performance indicators has been defined.
