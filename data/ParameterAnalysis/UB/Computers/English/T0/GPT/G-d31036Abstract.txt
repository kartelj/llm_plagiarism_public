This doctoral thesis primarily focuses on the development of a classification model, utilizing case-based reasoning (CBR) and intelligent selection of similarity measures to enhance the accuracy of new case classifications. The study explores the potential of domain knowledge, expressed through preference functions, to boost the predictive performance of a CBR system. It also investigates if a model that employs specific similarity measures for categorical data, combined with preference functions for numerical data similarity measurement, can outperform the conventional k-NN CBR model. 

In traditional CBR models, the Euclidean metric is used for numerical variable similarity measurement, while the overlap function is used for categorical attributes. Preference theory functions, offering more opportunities to express decision-maker preferences, could also be used for case similarity measurement. 

The thesis presents the results of classification models that use specific similarity measures for categorical attributes, combined with preference functions for numerical attributes. It also includes the optimization of attribute weights and the impact of the number of nearest neighbors considered on the models' predictive power. 

A genetic algorithm is employed to set the parameters of each preference function and attribute weights. The model's effectiveness is evaluated on three distinct benchmark datasets of clients seeking credit application consideration. The accuracy of the models is measured using a 10-fold cross-validation test, with cross-validation folds generated using a seed for data randomization. 

Experimental results indicate that the proposed approaches with preference theory functions consistently outperform the traditional k-NN classifier, irrespective of the similarity measures used for categorical attributes. However, models using preference theory functions and different categorical data similarity measures reveal that each dataset has an optimal technique, which includes an appropriate similarity measure for categorical attributes alongside preference theory functions.
