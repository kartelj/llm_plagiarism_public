The fundamental paradigm of modern society's progress is lifelong education and continuous training, which is driven by technological advancements and global business. The speed of education and learning has increased due to the evolution of IT and technological progress, leading to the emergence of new scientific knowledge, applications, and fields. In the 21st century, a new scientific discipline, business intelligence, emerged to explore data relationships in education. This discipline, known as Educational Data Mining, develops methods for analyzing and determining the legality of educational data and uses these methods to better understand student behavior and teaching progress.

The focus of this PhD thesis is the application of business intelligence in education to identify key factors for student success and improve the higher education process. The thesis examines the most important variables of a student, from their origin and high school success to their first year of undergraduate studies, and their correlation with overall study success. The thesis also proposes a new approach and method for predicting performance indicators in higher education institutions, based on current research and knowledge in the field of data mining in education.

The thesis also proposes an original software solution for analyzing, monitoring, and predicting undergraduate student success. This software is part of an integrated portal for knowledge and information exchange between students and faculty. The developed models for predicting study success were implemented and verified using the student database of the Faculty of Organizational Sciences, University of Belgrade.

The thesis is structured into 12 chapters, starting with an introduction that presents the objectives, hypotheses, and research plan. The next two chapters provide an overview of business intelligence and data mining, followed by a chapter outlining the projected research model. The fifth chapter applies concepts of descriptive and comparative analysis for a detailed definition of data structures and their interdependencies. Chapters six to eight introduce the development of a predictive model using various software environments and techniques. The ninth chapter provides a comparative analysis of the previously developed prediction model performance. The tenth chapter presents the basic structure and functionality of the information system for analyzing and monitoring higher education performance. The eleventh chapter summarizes the key results and provides guidelines for further development and improvement of predictive models. The final chapter provides an overview of the bibliography.

The thesis includes two appendices. The first appendix provides a detailed specification of cases where the developed information system is used. The second appendix presents a detailed presentation of the user interface and an analysis of data about performance and success factors.

The thesis presents a comprehensive research project applying business intelligence methods and techniques to analyze and predict undergraduate student success. The developed models can help professors identify students who need additional training or who have the ambition for continuous training and advanced education. The models can also be useful to students for predicting their university success based on their learning, working, and evaluation habits. Companies can also benefit from these models to identify potential future apprentices or employees. The thesis recommends using 14 models that achieve over 90% accuracy for predicting average study grades, average study length, or professional course assessments in the fourth year of study. The research results can help further introduce systems and models for predicting student success in higher education institutions and determine detailed requirements for future students to achieve more success. The results can also be used by other higher education systems with minimal upgrades and updates. An integrated system for monitoring undergraduate student success is developed, which can help higher education institutions make informed decisions and direct training optimally when creating the curriculum. The research results in the thesis can help bring educational data mining closer to researchers in Serbia and begin the process of introducing systems and models for predicting student success in higher education institutions.
