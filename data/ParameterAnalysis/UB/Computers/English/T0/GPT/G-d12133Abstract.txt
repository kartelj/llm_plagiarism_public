Determining the effort needed to develop a software system is a challenging yet crucial task in software engineering. The effort estimate often dictates whether a project will commence, the constraints under which it will operate, and its likelihood of successful completion and utilization. Unfortunately, these estimates are frequently based on incomplete requirements and rely heavily on heuristics, assumptions, and experience, all within a limited timeframe. Despite significant progress in various software engineering domains, effort estimation methods largely depend on the subjective evaluations of project teams or field experts, often resulting in higher than anticipated errors in effort estimates. Global statistics reveal that only a third of software projects are successfully completed, another third exceed budget and time constraints, while the remaining projects fail, primarily due to inaccurate effort estimates. This thesis aims to scrutinize existing effort estimation methods and suggest new ones to enhance effort estimation. The central concept to be explored in this thesis is the application of novel models and techniques to improve current effort estimation methods. The thesis will present proposals for enhancing existing evaluation methods and the tangible results that can be achieved by applying these solutions to actual software projects. The improvements are focused on identifying project parameters that most significantly impact the effort, as well as establishing the relationships between these parameters and the effort.
