The initial section of this thesis provides an examination of routing protocols within data center topologies, with a particular focus on two-phase routing protocols. These protocols are crucial for avoiding congestion in regular data center topologies that offer numerous alternative paths. A new two-phase routing algorithm, LB-ECR, is proposed in this thesis, which enhances the efficiency of data center networks. By employing linear programming, LB-ECR optimizes loss-free throughput based on the traffic requirements of the switches. LB-ECR is grounded in ECMP routing, a common feature in data centers due to its ability to utilize alternative equal-cost paths. Two-phase balancing simplifies the linear model by removing traffic flows and reducing congestion risks by spreading traffic across less busy links. This simplification makes it easier to solve the linear model for large data centers. The initial section of this thesis also provides a comparison of the performance of various routing algorithms in typical data center topologies.

In addition to optimizing routing, this thesis also investigates the algorithms used to update Internet routers' lookup tables. The second section of this thesis offers an overview of these lookup and update algorithms. The updating performance of two advanced lookup algorithms is scrutinized. Formulas for the worst-case memory requirements for two fast lookup algorithms are developed, and simulations are used to demonstrate the memory requirements for typical routing tables. The number of memory accesses to the lookup modules during updates, the complexity of the updating algorithms, and their execution time for typical routing tables are also evaluated.

The final section of this thesis details the implementation of the two-phase routing algorithms and the lookup update algorithms. It also discusses how these components are integrated within the router.
