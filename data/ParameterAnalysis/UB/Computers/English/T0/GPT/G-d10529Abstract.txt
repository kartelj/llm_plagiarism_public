Human resource development is heavily reliant on knowledge. For both individuals and companies to remain competitive and relevant in the market, the application of modern knowledge is essential. This knowledge can be gained through formal and informal education in schools, colleges, and workplaces, both traditional and online. Currently, there is a significant focus on e-learning and e-education, utilizing modern information-communication technologies, in the field of science. This PhD study examines the informal aspects of e-learning using Web 2.0 tools and the advantages of incorporating them into formal education processes. Despite the relative familiarity with e-learning methods, their implementation is still lacking, particularly in our context. This research investigates the effects of implementing informal e-learning methods using Web 2.0 tools (e-learning 2.0) on enhancing human resource potential. The concept of a personal learning environment is used to structure informal e-learning 2.0. This involves a shift from traditional pedagogy to pedagogy 2.0, moving from a teacher-controlled environment with a rigid learning regime to a more social, collaborative, and participatory approach that centers on the learner. To practically test these concepts, a pedagogical model for designing a personal e-learning 2.0 environment was created and applied through an action research study. A survey was conducted to assess knowledge of Web 2.0 tools and analyze their usage for learning among students of the Faculty of Organizational Sciences. The study concluded that the use of informal e-learning 2.0 in colleges is significantly influenced by individual student characteristics, potentials, field of study, and the organization of their courses. Fourth-year students studying information systems and technologies were identified as the ideal population to test the model. An action research study was conducted on the E-Learning course at the Faculty of Organizational Sciences to explore the potential of using personal learning environments (PLE) in formal education as a way of structuring informal e-learning 2.0. A pedagogical PLE model for e-learning 2.0 was created for this purpose. The model represents a new approach to designing a personal learning environment for e-learning 2.0. An activity algorithm was also designed as part of the model to guide its implementation through the teaching process. The study demonstrated the feasibility of applying the pedagogical PLE model for e-learning 2.0 in formal education. Most students responded positively to this learning organization, finding it creative and interesting. The overall conclusion is that formal education can be innovated using a pedagogical PLE model for e-learning 2.0 based on an informal learning concept. This could potentially influence the development of future employees' skills needed to work in a 2.0 environment, better preparing them for the modern working environment.
