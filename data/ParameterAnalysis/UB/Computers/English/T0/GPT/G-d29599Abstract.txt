This doctoral thesis primarily investigates the potential uses of virtual worlds in research and education. It delves into two main areas. The first area examines the idea of autonomous agents and agent theory within the realm of virtual worlds. The second area pertains to the educational uses of virtual worlds, with a particular emphasis on virtual laboratories. The thesis begins with a glossary of key terms related to the topic. It then provides an in-depth analysis of the role of agents in virtual worlds, including a study of the techniques that influence agent behavior. The thesis also presents the creation of a virtual gamified educational system specifically designed for agents, complete with a detailed description. Lastly, it analyzes the concept of virtual laboratories in Science, Technology, and Engineering (STE) disciplines, and assesses existing solutions based on the criteria outlined in the thesis.
