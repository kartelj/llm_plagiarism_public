The use of biometric technologies is becoming increasingly common in our modern society, to the point where they are now a part of our daily lives. Each biometric authentication system has its own unique requirements and constraints, depending on the specific context in which it is used. Choosing the right biometric modality and corresponding algorithm requires a thorough evaluation of the system's performance, which can be a complex task. This is true for both unimodal and multimodal biometric systems. Even when open biometric databases are available for evaluation, the system must be adapted to the testing protocol of the selected database. The evaluation process becomes even more complex if the system uses multiple biometric modalities due to the variety of fusion algorithms available. To address these challenges, this thesis introduces a unified evaluation model for multimodal biometric systems, as there is no detailed model currently available in the literature. This model is based on the Model Driven Architecture (MDA) paradigm and includes a metamodel of multimodal biometric system evaluation, which provides an ontology of terms used in this field. A prototype framework for evaluating multimodal biometric systems has been developed based on this model. This framework allows for the evaluation of multimodal biometric system performance in various use cases. Experimental results show that using this framework reduces the time needed for evaluation by 75%. Additionally, a new analytical method for optimizing the biometric system threshold, based on predefined system behavior, has been developed. Finally, a learning tool based on some of the framework's functionalities demonstrates how the framework can enhance the efficiency of training engineers in the field of biometrics.
