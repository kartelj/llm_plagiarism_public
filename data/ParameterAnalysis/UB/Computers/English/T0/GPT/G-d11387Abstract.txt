Wireless mesh networks (WMNs) are an emerging trend in wireless communications, offering more flexibility, reliability, and superior network performance compared to traditional wireless local area networks. The primary challenges in WMN design are enhancing throughput by incorporating a multi-channel multi-interface (MCMI) approach and considering the quality of service (QoS). To optimize network performance, it's crucial to establish protocols and routing metrics that identify the best path between the source and destination node. 

This dissertation proposes routing metrics that can quickly adapt to changes in signal dynamics, especially in complex environments like indoor settings. The three new metrics, powerETX, powerWCETT, and powerMIC, include a parameter dependent on the received signal level, in addition to the parameters defined in the existing ETX, WCETT, and MIC metrics. These new metrics offer higher data throughput, reduced average end-to-end delay, and can be implemented with minimal hardware and software modifications.

The dissertation also proposes a new protocol, QoS-HMCP, which introduces QoS support through the EDCA mechanism and leverages the benefits of the hybrid CA algorithm defined by the HMCP protocol. Four versions of the QoS-HMCP protocols are proposed, each considering different channel switching criteria and medium competition procedures. These versions are compared to the basic HMCP protocol in terms of user data throughput and network delay, and the results justify the introduction of QoS support into the MCMI network.

The dissertation concludes by identifying the best version of the QoS-HMCP protocol based on a comparison of throughput and delay for various traffic categories and network conditions. Additionally, it provides a comprehensive review of existing routing protocols, channel assignment strategies, and routing metrics for multi-channel multi-interface WMNs.
