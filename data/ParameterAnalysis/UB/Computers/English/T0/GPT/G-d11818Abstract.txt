This dissertation suggests merging the study of information systems and operational research by applying various soft computing and optimization techniques in a service-oriented approach to contemporary software development. Service-orientation, a new generation approach for creating distributed applications and automating business processes, can enhance business efficiency, agility, and productivity, and has thus become widely accepted. It is premised on the idea that distributed applications can be dynamically and flexibly composed by integrating independently developed software components or services, which can be developed on different platforms and in different programming languages. 

The application of service-oriented paradigm principles results in the development of services that are not tied to any specific business process and can thus be used in various applications in different ways. Web services are physically independent software components, accessible on the internet, which provide certain functionality. They are the predominant approach for implementing modern service-oriented software solutions due to their adherence to a set of widely adopted standards. 

With the proliferation of web services offering similar functionality, the problem of selecting the best one from a vast collection of suitable services is becoming increasingly important. The non-functional properties of services, or Quality of Service (QoS), play a significant role in this process. The selection is usually based on multiple non-functional characteristics, which are very heterogeneous in nature. 

When the desired functionality cannot be provided by a single service but might be achieved by executing a set of services, each providing part of the desired functionality, the task becomes even more complex. A service composition represents an aggregation of services collaborating collectively to automate a specific task or business process. The main advantage of this approach to application development is that existing services can be used to meet new business demands or automate new business processes with less effort and in a more cost-effective way. 

The web service selection problem for a composition involves choosing actual services for each component of the established composition in such a way that the resulting composition not only meets the desired functional requirements but is also optimal in terms of the relevant QoS requirements. 

This thesis critically reviews existing approaches for modeling these problems and discusses their drawbacks. To address these issues, two new models are proposed which do not require the assignment of arbitrary preferences or the normalization QoS values. The aim is also to allow users to more adequately specify the trade-offs they might be willing to make, which can usually only be formulated as complex verbal statements. 

For the selection of services for a particular functionality, an innovative approach based on the combination of the Analytical Hierarchy Process method (AHP) and Boolean consistent fuzzy logic is proposed. For the selection of services for a composition, several methods are proposed, including an adaptation of an existing exact method for solving the posed MOFP problem and the use of heuristic methods for larger, time-critical problems. 

The validation of the proposed approaches is supported by a specially developed software solution. Finally, the possibility of a wider application of the proposed approaches is discussed.
