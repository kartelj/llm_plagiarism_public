The prevalence of three-dimensional (3D) videos in both wired and wireless networks is increasing, leading to a significant network load due to their high data content. This necessitates the improvement of methods to manage this type of data. This thesis focuses on the fractal and multifractal characterization of 3D video formats. The primary objectives are to demonstrate that 3D video possesses fractal and multifractal properties, describe these properties, compare them across different 3D formats, and explore potential applications in traffic modeling of 3D video formats and the development of enhanced transport techniques for video smoothing and statistical multiplexing. 

Mathematical methods for complex systems and chaos, including algorithms and software realizations, were developed in Matlab and Python. These were used to determine fractal properties (using the aggregated variance method, the R/S statistic method, and the multiscale method) and multifractal properties (using the method of moments for multifractal spectra and estimation of the generalized dimensions and the histogram method for multifractal spectra and inverse multifractal analysis). 

The results confirm the fractal and multifractal properties of 3D video formats. Comparisons were made across various 3D video formats, video structures, frame types, encoder quantization parameters, frame aggregations, and video streaming methods.
