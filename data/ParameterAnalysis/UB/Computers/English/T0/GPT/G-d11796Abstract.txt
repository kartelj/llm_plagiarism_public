Wireless sensor networks are systems composed of numerous small computing devices, known as sensor nodes. These nodes are equipped with one or more sensors to collect environmental data and can establish radio communications with other nodes in the network. These networks can generate vast amounts of data, making them ideal for implementing machine learning techniques. The objective of this work is to adapt certain data mining algorithms for distributed execution, enabling them to run directly on the sensor nodes.

The analysis of the problem has led to three fundamental requirements for a distributed data mining algorithm suitable for execution in a wireless sensor network. Firstly, it is crucial to minimize the communication between the nodes as it consumes substantial energy. Secondly, the algorithm should produce accurate results. Lastly, the use of centralized computational resources should be minimized as much as possible.

The primary contribution of this thesis is the development of two innovative algorithms for distributed machine learning, tailored to meet the needs of execution in a wireless sensor network. The first algorithm is a two-layer classification scheme. The first layer runs on the sensor nodes and can employ any classifier (tested using J48 decision trees). The results are then forwarded to a centralized, second layer classifier based on a weighted voting scheme. The second algorithm is a clustering algorithm, based on Kohonen neural networks, adapted to the nature of the data obtained from sensor nodes in wireless sensor networks. This data contains two sources of variability: the location information of a sensed event and the properties of the event. Accordingly, the proposed Kohonen neural network is designed with two layers, the first layer clusters data according to the location of origin, and the second layer clusters data based on the event type.

Calculations indicate that both proposed algorithms significantly reduce energy consumption. The accuracy of the algorithms was confirmed through computational simulations. In conclusion, the proposed algorithms are suitable for various practical applications, and the machine learning techniques provide a feasible approach to constructing sustainable large wireless sensor networks.
