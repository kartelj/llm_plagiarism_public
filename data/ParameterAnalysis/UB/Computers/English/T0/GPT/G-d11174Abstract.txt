Managerial control is a crucial tool for managing, implementing corporate strategies, and enhancing a company's business performance. The effectiveness of this control is largely dependent on the information available to decision-makers, including past performance data and future projections. These aspects are studied within business performance measurement systems, making the development or implementation of such systems vital for successful decision-making. 

To meet managerial information needs, managerial accountants and other experts have worked to establish principles, concepts, techniques, and procedures for developing business performance measurement systems. Current research also tackles the challenges of developing specific systems. Despite over a decade of work on these issues, the development and use of these systems are still in their early stages, making them a hot topic in both academic and practical management circles. 

This doctoral thesis aims to develop a new business performance measurement system, focusing on determining the factors that influence the system's construction, including the number of performance measures to be included and how the system should be used. The contingency theory in management accounting forms the basis of this dissertation, leading to the identification of a set of factors that influence the diversity and use of the performance measurement system. 

The study also examined the impact of performance measurement systems on an organization's financial and non-financial success, using primary data from an empirical study to validate the theoretical model. This type of study has not been conducted in Serbia before, and only partially outside Serbia, making this a comprehensive and unique contribution. 

The findings show that Serbian companies use a wide range of performance measures, and the factors identified in the theoretical model influence both the diversity and use of performance measurement systems. However, their importance varies significantly. The balanced use of financial and non-financial performance indicators significantly impacts business success. These findings could be beneficial to other researchers in performance measurement, management control, and management accounting, as well as to practitioners, consultants, and managers in developing performance measurement systems in specific companies.
