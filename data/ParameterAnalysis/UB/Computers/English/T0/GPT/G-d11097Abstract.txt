Market positioning is a concept that involves active participation in creating tourist offers or services, allowing tourism companies to secure an optimal market position. The initial approach to positioning, which began in the 1970s, focused on a single company's promotional activities. The main challenge for marketers was to secure a unique place in consumers' minds through marketing efforts. Despite various interpretations and definitions of the positioning concept, no universal market coordinates have been established to ensure an optimal, stable, and sustainable market position. As the positioning concept evolved, the methods to achieve positioning goals have varied, from multidimensional scaling to discriminant, factor, and conjoint analysis. 

This dissertation proposes a new approach to market positioning problems, combining statistical models and operational research models. This approach allows marketing managers to respond promptly and formulate market positioning strategies in a competitive environment. The proposed model offers the potential to anticipate competitors' moves, balance the focus on consumer preferences and competition, and better formulate the optimal market strategy. 

Conjoint analysis is used to assess consumer preferences, providing insight into market heterogeneity and the potential to determine the optimal features of a tourist product. In the case of heterogeneous preferences, market segmentation can be achieved using cluster analysis. However, considering the competitive nature of the modern market, all possible market interactions must be considered. This seemingly chaotic market conflict conceals rationalities that can be modeled using game theory concepts. 

The combined application of these three models (conjoint analysis, cluster analysis, and game theory) offers a better way to determine the optimal market position than previous methods that used these models separately. The effectiveness of this unique market positioning model is demonstrated through its application to real-world gastronomy events. 

The proposed model's adaptability, flexibility, and potential for dynamic decision-making are particularly significant. It can be reused in response to changes in market conditions, such as the launch of a new product, improvements to an existing product, or changes in consumer preferences, to achieve an optimal market position. In the future, this model could be widely applied across all sectors of tourism and services, serving as a general paradigm for determining the optimal market position.
