This doctoral thesis primarily focuses on the creation and empirical application of an internal credit rating model for medium and large Serbian companies. The primary objective is to quantify the credit risk of these companies using a newly developed credit scoring model and assess their credit quality using the developed internal credit rating model. The research is based on seven years of financial statements, including balance sheets and income statements, from Serbian companies from 2006 to 2012. This data allows for the quantification of the default probability of Serbian companies, taking into account the specific characteristics of the market and business environment. 

The thesis covers three broad areas using a novel methodology developed by the author. The first involves analyzing a large number of financial ratios and identifying the most predictive financial ratio in Serbia based on historical data. The transformation of financial ratio data was used to develop the credit scoring model. The resulting new credit scoring model, which quantifies default probability, has greater predictive power than models like the Altman Z-score model used in foreign markets. 

The final product is an internal credit rating model developed using an original approach that incorporates results from the previously developed credit scoring model. The final models and their results underwent a validation process based on relevant academic literature and new Basel Capital Accord standards. Credit risk weights were calculated based on Basel II and III principles, and the results confirmed the initial hypothesis of the doctoral dissertation.
