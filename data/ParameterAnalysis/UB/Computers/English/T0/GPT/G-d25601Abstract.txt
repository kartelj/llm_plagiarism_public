Current trends in computer design are focused on enhancing the performance of computer systems to the maximum extent possible to cater to the need for processing vast amounts of data. The design of the processor, being the primary player in the data processing process, is the main focus. However, the growth trends in processor performance, as predicted by Moore's Law, have been slowing down due to the physical constraints of semiconductor technology, making it increasingly difficult to boost performance. Various techniques are being explored to counter this issue, aiming to enhance performance without increasing transistor and power consumption. This thesis considers asymmetric multicore processors with support for transactional memory. Two novel techniques are proposed to boost the performance of such processors. One technique aims to mitigate transaction congestion due to high parallelism by moving transactions to a faster core. The transactions that are most likely to cause congestion are chosen for migration. Running them on a faster core decreases their likelihood of conflict with other transactions, thereby increasing the chances of avoiding congestion. Another technique modifies the cache subsystem to decrease cache access latency and the likelihood of false conflicts while reducing the number of transistors needed for cache implementation. This can be achieved by using small, simple caches. Detailed proposals for implementing both techniques are provided. Prototypes of these techniques were created in the Gem5 simulator, which accurately models a processor's system. Using these prototypes, the proposed techniques were evaluated by simulating a large number of applications from a standard benchmark set for transactional memory. The analysis of the simulation results provided insights into when and how the proposed techniques should be utilized.
