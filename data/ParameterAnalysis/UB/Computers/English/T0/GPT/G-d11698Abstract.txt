Gamma scintillation cameras (GSC) are used in the medical field to analyze the distribution of radiopharmaceuticals that have been injected, inhaled, or ingested. The evolution of integrated circuit technology has impacted the construction of GSCâ€™s head and the flexibility, speed, cost, and expandability of its supported systems for image acquisition, storage, and analysis. Despite the digital GSC era starting in the 1980s, many nuclear medical centers still use analogue or semi-analogue GSCs with fully operational mechanics and scintillation crystals, which are essential for nuclear imaging. The ideal solution is to digitize GSC and integrate it with modern computer systems. 

This doctoral thesis presents the development of a computer system, the GammaKey system, that provides functionality to semi-analogue GSCs, is compatible with modern digital systems, and has an open architecture that allows for the development and clinical application of new diagnostic techniques. The GammaKey system meets several requirements, including simple replacement of the original computer system, reliability, compatibility with other systems, easy and affordable upgrades, and the development and implementation of novel non-standard acquisition protocols and tools for study processing. 

The GammaKey system includes standard functions for image processing and manipulation, as well as standard functions for scintigraphic study processing. It also includes three non-standard features: EffSpleen acquisition and analysis, Submarine analysis, and SalivaryScan analysis. 

The GammaKey system has been used in daily clinical practice in two leading medical centers in Serbia and has been used to examine more than 30,000 patients. It enables the continuity of basic clinical practice, as well as following modern trends, continuity in research, defining valid reference values, and the possibility of validation of other applications. This system fully supports the Evidence Based Medicine (EBM) concept.
