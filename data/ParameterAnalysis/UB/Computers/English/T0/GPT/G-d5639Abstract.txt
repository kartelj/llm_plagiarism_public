The introductory section of this research outlines the area of study, main objectives, key hypotheses, research methods, and provides a detailed overview of the dissertation, highlighting the essential aspects of the work. The second section delves into the concept of efficiency and the methods used to evaluate and measure it, a crucial component in modern business decision-making. Efficiency is defined as the ability to minimize input to achieve maximum results. The challenge arises when measuring the efficiency of organizations that utilize various types of inputs to produce different outputs. The research aims to develop a new statistical model of efficiency that can handle different types of input/output variables by integrating all indicators into a single value. The Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) method, a popular method for measuring efficiency, is explained. The DEA method was developed to measure the efficiency of organizational units, particularly non-profit ones, by integrating multiple inputs and outputs into one virtual input and output. The Stochastic Frontier Analysis (SFA) method, an alternative approach to measuring efficiency using econometric models, is also discussed. 

The third chapter shifts focus to multivariate data analysis, which involves collecting many observations on a large number of variables. This allows for the analysis of complex data sets with many interdependent and independent variables. The chapter primarily focuses on two key statistical methods: principal component analysis (PCA) and factor analysis, and cluster analysis. The main difference between these two methods is the way data is examined. Factor analysis focuses on covariance, while PCA examines variances. 

The fourth chapter focuses on the I-distance method, a method developed by Prof. Branislav IvanoviÄ‡ for ranking countries based on a large number of variables. The method involves creating a fictitious entity with the minimum values for each indicator/variable and measuring the distance of other entities from this fictitious entity. The I-distance method is capable of integrating a large number of different measured variables into a single value. 

The fifth chapter presents a new statistical efficiency model based on the I-distance method, named Distance Based Analysis (DBA). The DBA method was applied to various sectors including university scientific output, banking, health, and regional efficiency in Serbia. The dissertation significantly enhances the methods for measuring efficiency and makes significant progress in the I-distance method. 

The conclusion provides responses to each research issue and hypothesis, systematizes the scientific contributions, and outlines possibilities for further research. An extensive bibliography is provided, and the appendix includes results from the I-distance method improvement experiment.
