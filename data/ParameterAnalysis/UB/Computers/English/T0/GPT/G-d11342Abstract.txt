Conducting business in today's world involves managing relationships with a multitude of stakeholders. Establishing good relations with these stakeholders is considered a primary objective for businesses, as a stable business network is viewed as a crucial asset for any company. Communication plays a vital role in these relationships, making strategic or corporate communications an essential part of the company-stakeholder relationship. These communications focus on building and positioning the corporate brand, a concept that is of interest to both academics and practitioners due to its proven impact on business outcomes. It is seen as a significant source of sustainable competitiveness and a key component of corporate strategy. The positioning of a corporate brand is viewed as the company's overall approach in relation to its competitors, and how stakeholders perceive the company in comparison to these competitors. This dissertation explores the specifics, types, and framework of corporate brand positioning, based on a review of existing literature on the subject. Using scientific and professional literature and empirical research results, a strategic framework for managing corporate communications is established for the purpose of positioning the corporate brand. The author has developed a model of corporate brand positioning and determined a measure known as the Corporate Brand Positioning Score (CBPS). The research identifies and measures business aspects that affect corporate brand positioning among six citizens/business communities, and determines the structure of the model and measure of corporate brand positioning among these communities. It also identifies how demographic characteristics of citizens or business community characteristics influence the connection between the perception of certain business aspects and corporate brand positioning. The research shows that the perception of all defined components, including perception position, attitude towards the company, social responsibility, management, and companies/products, influences the positioning of the corporate brand among Serbian citizens to varying degrees. In determining the CBPS for the business community, characteristics of the corporate brand, referred to as determinants, are used. These include reliability, neutrality, efficiency, independence, adherence to principles, good employee relations, social responsibility, understanding of smaller companies, professionalism, and credibility. From a corporate brand positioning perspective, nurturing these determinants is crucial as their values impact the CBPS. The research findings highlight aspects that are important for positioning the corporate brand among citizens and the business community, and provide a foundation for strategic communications with stakeholders.
