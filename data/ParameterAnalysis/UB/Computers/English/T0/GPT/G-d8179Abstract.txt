This thesis explores the creation and use of a model for interoperable e-Business payment systems, utilizing ontologies and the Resource-Event-Agent - REA (ISO/IEC 15944-4:2007) ontological object system structure. The research is grounded in referential models for information exchange based on global financial industry standards. It will draw on insights gained from the implementation of the Check Clearing and Direct Debit systems within the Association of Serbian Banks, which were developed using Enterprise Integration Patterns (EIP) and standardized messaging systems. The study will be tailored to the implementation of interoperable payment systems in Serbia.

The research addresses the challenge of disparate business processes, data, and IT technologies in various payment systems and participants' business systems, which interact during electronic transactions. These systems support numerous users and business processes, each with unique requirements. The inefficiencies in data transfer between systems result in wasted time, financial, and informatics resources.

The increasing prevalence of electronic financial transactions necessitates the development of models for interoperable e-Business payment systems for transaction exchange and processing. The standardization of payment system modeling, as discussed in this study, should enhance the efficiency of other electronic business systems and improve the interoperability of participants' electronic businesses.

In every country, the payment system includes various payment instruments, banking procedures, and fund transfer systems between financial institutions, facilitating money circulation. The Central Bank directly controls and regulates the money flow and oversees the payment systems. The Real Time Gross Settlement System - RTGS, under the Central Bank's supervision, is particularly significant. It connects the systems of banks and other financial institutions, including clearing houses, payment agents, processing houses, and others, as defined by law.

This study describes how payment systems unify various elements, such as message-based systems, technological elements of supervising institutions, standard message format requirements, environmental conditions imposed by the location with the implemented payment system, necessary communication interactions, and required information technologies.

Ontologies, which are formal descriptions of objects, their characteristics, and relationships in a specific domain, are explicitly understandable for humans and computers. In this study, the ontological approach ensures interoperability and consistency in the model and enhances the model's design from the knowledge domain. The ISO 15944-4:2007 standard, which will be examined in this study, provides the ontological foundation for specifying the concepts and relations involved in business transactions and scenarios, known as the Resource-Event-Agent â€“ REA ontology.
