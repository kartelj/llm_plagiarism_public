The aim of this thesis is to explore and elucidate the potential for enhancing decision-making in the process of choosing the most economically viable bidder in public e-procurement. This choice is guided by predetermined criteria set by the buyer in public e-procurement. The selection process is straightforward when there are only a few bidders and when there are established quantitative criteria for comparison. However, real-world scenarios often involve a large number of bidders, and the most suitable one is chosen based on both qualitative and quantitative criteria. The central hypothesis of this thesis, which has been validated within the context of the doctoral research, is that the application of multi-criteria decision-making methods and fuzzy set theory can enhance the selection of the most economically viable bidder in public e-procurement when both quantitative and qualitative criteria are used. In such a selection process, it is feasible to ascertain the values linked to the output variable that corresponds to the weights of criteria belonging to a fuzzy set through defuzzification, or the selection of a single output variable value with the same quantification. Concurrently, the thesis introduces a decision support system based on multi-criteria decision-making and fuzzy set theory. This system is a crucial component of the public e-procurement web portal, facilitating a collaborative workspace that seamlessly integrates buyers and suppliers into a unified virtual platform for e-procurement.
