This thesis introduces a novel solution to the well-documented performance issue of accessing pixels in memory for SIMD (Single-Instruction Multiple-Data) processors used in image and video processing. The proposed solution is a parallel on-chip memory subsystem with new functionalities and an innovative architecture, which results in higher processing throughput and less energy consumption per processed pixel compared to existing subsystems.

The thesis first outlines the new functionalities of the parallel memory subsystem, including new block and row access modes. These modes are more suited to the requirements of image and video processing algorithms than those of current parallel memory subsystems. The new access modes significantly decrease the number of on-chip memory read and write accesses, thereby speeding up the imaging/video kernels that are the focus of this work. The new access modes also reduce the energy consumed by the parallel memory subsystem for the same amount of processed pixels, by decreasing the number of repeated accesses of the same pixels.

The thesis also presents a parametric, scalable, and cost-efficient architecture that supports the new access modes, as well as access modes of existing parallel memory subsystems. The architecture is based on a previously proposed set of memory banks with multiple pixels per addressable word of a bank, a previously proposed shifted scheme for arranging pixels in the banks that enables parallel access to all pixels of a block/row, and control logic that implements the shifted scheme in the memory banks and the access modes.

The benefits of the proposed parallel memory subsystem are demonstrated both analytically and experimentally on a case study of the well-known 3DRS sub-pixel block-matching motion estimation algorithm. The implemented block-matcher, based on the proposed parallel memory subsystem, can process 3840*2160 video at the rate of 60 frames per second, while clocked at 600 MHz. Compared to block-matcher implementations based on six state-of-the-art subsystems and the same SIMD datapath, this work enables 40 – 70% higher throughput, consumes 17 – 44% less energy, and has similar silicon area and off-chip memory bandwidth costs.

The proposed parallel memory subsystem is used in the most recent and most advanced Intel processors and systems-on-chip for imaging and video processing on mobile devices due to its proven efficiency. It is also being continuously improved for use in future generations of Intel processors.
