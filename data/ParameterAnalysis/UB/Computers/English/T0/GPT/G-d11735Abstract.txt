The process of digital image compression and coding involves reducing the memory resources necessary for displaying, storing, and transmitting digital images. Utilizing compression techniques can result in significant savings. Quick algorithms and structures for compression and decompression are crucial in applications that require real-time performance. Current methods for digital image compression with a high compression ratio are slow and necessitate complex processors and large amounts of high bandwidth memory, which also increases power usage. As the compression ratio increases, so do the processing time and memory capacity. In this doctoral thesis, we tackled the issue of creating a codec hardware that minimizes the necessary memory resources, operates quickly, and has a high compression ratio. This was achieved through the use of combined scientific methods. Optimized nonstationary filters and a new two-dimensional subband transformation algorithm, as well as a one-pass probability estimator realization, were used to minimize the required memory resources. The operation speed was achieved through a one-pass algorithm for probability estimation and the fact that the input image is not partially processed. The high compression ratio was achieved through the combined effects of all subsystems in the realization: subband transformer, quantizer, one-pass probability estimator, and entropy encoder. The hardware realization from this thesis was verified through an image compression system with a network interface. It was demonstrated that it is feasible to implement a complete color image encoder within a low-cost programmable logic device, without the need for external memory components.
