The selection of a routing strategy in a packet network significantly influences the reliability and overall data transmission quality. It also affects the utilization of various network resources, with poor routing decisions potentially leading to network bottlenecks and reduced throughput. Network latency and cost are also dependent on the selected routing strategy. To identify the optimal routing strategy for a specific network and anticipated traffic, routing optimization is carried out. The aim of routing optimization is to achieve the best possible value for the selected network performance metric. Optimization can be performed to maximize network throughput, minimize network cost, reduce latency, etc.

This paper will discuss the issues of maximizing network throughput and minimizing network cost. We will concentrate on non-blocking networks, which ensure service to all users generating and receiving traffic within set boundaries, irrespective of the current traffic distribution in the network. We will introduce a new routing scheme based on load balancing and shortest path routing, referred to as load balanced routing (LBR). This proposed routing protocol can be optimized using linear programming to either minimize cost or maximize network throughput.

The proposed routing scheme can be easily implemented in practice. Shortest path routing is commonly used, and our proposed routing is a modification that can be implemented relatively easily. The linear program's dimension is manageable, and the optimization time is reasonable. With our proposed routing, we can guarantee service to a larger number of users than with regular shortest path routing. Additionally, the cost of servicing a specific number of users is lower if our proposed routing is used instead of the shortest path routing.

We will first present the proposed load balanced routing and the linear program for its optimization. We will then evaluate the performance of the proposed routing scheme and compare it to the performance of the shortest path routing. Specifically, we will focus on two scenarios. In the first, we will optimize the load balanced routing to achieve maximum network throughput. We will demonstrate that the proposed load balanced routing can significantly increase the guaranteed network throughput compared to regular shortest path routing. In the second scenario, we will optimize the load balanced routing to achieve the minimum network cost that can support given user demands. We will demonstrate that the network cost with load balanced routing is lower than the network cost using shortest path routing.

We will conduct analyses for both standard and realistic network topologies. We will also analyze networks where service reliability is required in the event of a single resource (link or router) failure. We will demonstrate that the performance of the proposed load balanced routing is superior to the performance of shortest path routing in all these scenarios.
