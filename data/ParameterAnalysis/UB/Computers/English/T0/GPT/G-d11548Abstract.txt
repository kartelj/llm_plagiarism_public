The progression of contemporary society is heavily reliant on superior telecommunication networks. Ensuring these networks have high availability is crucial for the seamless functioning of services used by end users. Presently, backbone networks are typically comprised of a large number of nodes, making the direct calculation of network availability challenging due to the exponential increase in algorithm execution time with the increase in nodes and links. Hence, the use of approximation algorithms during network design is practically significant for defining initial conditions for network topology design. 

This PhD thesis introduces a new method for the approximate calculation of maximum availability of complex telecommunication networks. A network synthesis method was developed to obtain maximum availability values. The initial network topology for this method is a chain. The first step in determining maximum network availability is to form a ring, then continue adding links one-by-one to the network topology to maximize all-terminal availability. 

The synthesis of the network is performed by adding one link at a time, where all links have the same availability, ensuring each step has maximum availability for a given number of nodes, links, and link availability. The approximation functions of maximum network availability for a given number of nodes, links, and link availability are derived from the analysis of the network synthesis method results for networks with maximum availability. 

The network's availability limits, which depend on the network topology, can be calculated using the approximation functions. These functions can also define the boundaries for the number of links needed to achieve the desired availability with the appropriate network topology choice. It has been demonstrated that for maximum network availability, all nodes should have the same connectivity, differing by at most one. 

Knowing the predetermined limit on the number of links in the network, the network design process can be completed in a few iterations to achieve the requested availability. The running time of the approximation functions defined in this dissertation does not depend on network size, allowing for a large number of calculations and analysis of numerous combinations of input parameters. 

The approximation functions defined in this thesis have been shown to be more accurate than those published in existing literature. The calculated approximate values were compared with the exact availability values, showing that the relative error of approximation is significantly less than 1% for networks whose links have an availability greater than 0.75.
