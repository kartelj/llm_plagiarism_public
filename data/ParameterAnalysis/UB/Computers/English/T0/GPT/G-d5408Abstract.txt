E-learning is a multifaceted system that encompasses distance learning, lectures, and classroom materials in various digital formats, as well as individual and group learning processes, tutoring, and interactive work. The rapid and significant growth in users, services, educational content, and necessary resources presents new optimization challenges for educational institutions and their e-learning systems, along with the need for dynamic competitiveness and cost control. This results in increasingly complex demands for the development and implementation of IT infrastructure for e-learning systems. By utilizing modern information and communication technologies, the efficiency, flexibility, and cost-effectiveness of e-learning systems can be enhanced. The introduction of IT infrastructure models for e-learning based on the modern IT concept of Cloud Computing can improve the reliability, scalability, and cost-effectiveness of educational processes. The lack of scientific support for the application of the Cloud Computing concept in modeling the IT infrastructure of higher education in the Republic of Serbia and the strategic importance of this concept highlights the need for theoretical support for its more efficient development and application. This dissertation research focuses on defining and developing plans and activities for higher education institutions related to the development of an IT infrastructure model for e-learning using the Cloud Computing concept. Higher education institutions face numerous challenges, primarily related to digital identity and access management, as they explore existing and new ways to provide services to students and research staff. The most significant challenge is the prompt adoption and implementation of digital identity management systems. A successful IT infrastructure for digital identity management requires a systematic approach to identities and the interdependencies between them. Another challenge is to support a system that can fully utilize the benefits of federation systems for digital identity management. The development of such federations among educational institutions facilitates the mobility of users, content, and services. The primary hypothesis formulated and validated in this doctoral thesis is that the application of a developed IT infrastructure model can enhance the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of e-learning systems. The experimental portion of the doctoral thesis includes research aimed at validating the proposed IT infrastructure model for e-learning, conducted in the E-Business Laboratory at the Faculty of Organizational Sciences. The research results indicate that the implemented IT infrastructure model enhances the efficiency, flexibility, and cost-effectiveness of the e-learning system.
