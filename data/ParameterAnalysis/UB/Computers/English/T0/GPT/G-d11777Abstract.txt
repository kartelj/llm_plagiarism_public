The data warehouse serves as the foundation for the execution of business intelligence systems, data amalgamation, and decision support. Typically, a dimensional model is constructed for the data warehouse to enhance data visualization. The architecture of a data warehouse outlines the basic elements of a data warehouse and illustrates the relationship and structure of these elements. 

Two primary approaches exist in data warehouse architecture. The first, known as Corporate Information Factory (CIF) architecture, is advocated by Bill Inmon, who asserts that a data warehouse should be normalized and contain atomic data in the third normal form. The second approach, referred to as BUS architecture, is championed by Ralph Kimball, who argues that a warehouse should also possess a multi-dimensional structure. 

The Data Vault concept, designed by Daniel Linstedt, is a detail-oriented, historically tracked, and uniquely linked group of normalized tables that support one or more business functional areas. This hybrid approach combines the best features of the third normal form (3NF) and star scheme. The Data Vault concept underscores the importance of tracking the source and timing of data entry into the database and allows for easy modifications in the data warehouse structure to align with changes in the business environment. 

Despite the various methodological approaches to building data warehouses, the process of designing a data warehouse and the associated dimensional model is not automated. This dissertation examines the issue of the data warehouse design process, based on an extensive literature review, and explores the potential for automating the physical design of a data warehouse using the Data Vault concept, with minimal user interaction. 

The study presents a straightforward algorithm for automating the physical design of a data warehouse, using a data model with metadata transactional data sources and rules. This algorithm simplifies, generalizes, and largely automates the physical design process for data warehouses based on structured, semi-structured, and simple non-structured data sources. 

The relational model is a shared factor for both Data Vault implementation and original data, hence all types are abstracted with a meta-model. The direct approach implies that the Physical Data Vault (PDV) is directly realized based on the physical data source model in relational form. 

The conceptualization of metadata is demonstrated with a physical data model that, with minor modifications, can be utilized in the design of individual data warehouses, representing the fundamental methodological contribution of this study. Furthermore, this study provides a comprehensive integrated approach to automating data warehouse design, as it enables the design of data marts and related ETL processes. 

This integration facilitates the realization of the entire data warehouse. Based on the research findings, a prototype application supporting the physical design of a data warehouse was developed. Experiments with the algorithm, using the prototype application on a real-world case in healthcare insurance, yielded satisfactory results.
