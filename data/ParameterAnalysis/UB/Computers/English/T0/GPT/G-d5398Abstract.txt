This dissertation presents a model for interoperable e-business statistical systems, utilizing service-oriented architecture and web services. The research is tailored for use in the statistical system of the Republic of Serbia. Official statistics, a crucial component in the information system of any democratic society, provides data on economic, demographic, social, and environmental conditions. The primary role of official statistics is to accurately depict social and economic trends within a country, providing a reliable foundation for analysis and decision-making at various levels, from government and institutions to businesses and individuals. The Republic of Serbia's official statistics operate based on principles outlined in the UN Economic-Social Council's document on basic principles of official statistics, and the European Commission's Practical Codex of European Statistics. Most countries have one or more National Statistical Institutions (NSIs) that collectively form the country's national statistical system. These systems' main responsibilities include collecting, storing, and analyzing statistical data, and distributing this data to various user groups. Within each NSI, statistical production is carried out through different production lines and processes for various statistical areas. Typically, NSIs' business architecture is based on the so-called stove-pipe model, where each statistical area within an NSI forms an independent production line. Each domain carries out the full production process, from research planning to data collection and analysis, independently of other domains, and has its own data, sources, and users. Electronic data exchange is a common method of communication among statistical services, but it often faces issues with interoperability and data conversion. This dissertation suggests adopting universal standards for statistical data sharing and exchange, with the primary objective of establishing widely accepted standards to facilitate quick and easy access to data and metadata. The service-oriented architecture of the statistical information system allows for interoperability at both the application and business process levels. Semantic level interoperability is achieved by designing a common domain ontology and developing a common data model based on domain ontology.
