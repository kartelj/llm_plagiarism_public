Despite significant advancements in artificial intelligence, the human brain remains superior in understanding and manipulating partially known facts. This is particularly evident in the field of question answering, where human experts excel in explaining, combining complex answers, and abstract reasoning. Intelligent Question Routing Systems (IQRS) act as a medium for knowledge exchange in any field requiring intensive user communication. The benefits of these systems include reducing unnecessary engagement of experts and improving the quality of service for system owners, as users are more satisfied with answers provided by the right individuals. 

This dissertation presents a methodology for designing IQRS systems, beginning with a review of existing research, focusing on the implementation of IQRS process phases. It introduces a unique presentation paradigm that encapsulates the essence of approaches found in existing literature. This paradigm includes three basic processing stages related to system implementation: question analysis, question forwarding, and usersâ€™ knowledge profiling. 

The dissertation then proposes a new approach to address identified problems and describes an IQRS prototype implementing these ideas. The question analysis module enables question visualization and combines automatic text processing with manual correction, allowing users to enhance output accuracy. The text processing module is also used for answer analysis. 

The dissertation discusses existing methods for determining semantic similarity between two short texts, focusing on those suitable for languages with limited electronic linguistic resources, like Serbian. A new algorithm, LInSTSS, is proposed, which considers the specificity of words in the texts. A Serbian paraphrase corpus is constructed and the results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms existing solutions. 

The dissertation also proposes a new algorithm, P2Q, for comparing questions and user profiles. An analysis of available web portals is conducted to find one suitable for creating a questions and answers corpus. The corpus is used to test the initial hypothesis and evaluate overall system performance. The results show that the P2Q approach significantly outperforms other evaluated approaches and that semantic information extraction from text can improve results. 

The dissertation concludes that properly assigned weights can enhance system performance, but incorrect assignment can significantly decrease performance. It also emphasizes the importance of considering both the questions that express interests and the answers that the user best answered when profiling user competence.
