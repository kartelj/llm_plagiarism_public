This study aims to develop and empirically test a comprehensive model of retail customer loyalty in Serbia. It began with a literature review on the main factors influencing service customer loyalty, such as service quality, satisfaction, and perceived value. The research was conducted using a structured questionnaire on a convenience sample of 737 customers from non-specialized, food-focused retail stores. Multivariate data analysis techniques were used, utilizing SPSS 18 and LISREL 8.80 software packages. 

The results from the exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis revealed a multidimensional aspect of service quality in the Serbian retail context. Four dimensions of retail service quality were identified: (F1) Employee behavior and appearance, (F2) Atmospherics, (F3) Customer communication, and (F4) Spatial layout and assortment. 

Structural equation modeling showed that customer satisfaction was the most significant factor influencing customer loyalty, followed by perceived value. The latter had both a direct and indirect effect on loyalty, mediated through satisfaction. The study also found that service quality significantly impacts customer loyalty. Although it did not have a statistically significant direct effect on loyalty, it indirectly influenced it through satisfaction and perceived value. 

The findings highlight the need to measure and enhance customer satisfaction, perceived value, and service quality to build a loyal customer base. Future studies should focus on developing a service quality scale and measuring customer satisfaction and perceived value using a representative sample of Serbian retail customers, as this study was based on a convenience sample.
