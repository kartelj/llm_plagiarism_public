This thesis explores the use of contemporary software engineering techniques in the development of open source software for intelligent systems. The primary outcomes include a universal software framework model and guidelines for managing open source projects within this domain. The framework model and project management recommendations were established and tested in a real-world setting through the enhancement of a chosen software framework for neural networks. This selected neural network framework is a prominent Java open source neural network framework. The proposed software development techniques can also be applied to other areas of intelligent systems, addressing specific challenges and requirements in this field. These challenges primarily stem from the need for research-oriented software to also be practical and user-friendly, despite its inherent complexity. The suggested development methods encompass requirements specification, planning, design, implementation, and maintenance, and are presented as proven best practices. Besides its theoretical and methodological contributions, this thesis also offers practical value by introducing new features to a chosen framework in the field of intelligent systems, significantly improving its practical use.
