The surge in data and devices has spurred the swift advancement of technology and machine learning algorithms utilized in data analysis and processing systems. The performance of these systems relies entirely on the quality of the data, the chosen algorithm, and its parameters. Data anomalies, which deviate from data distribution and impact data quality, can be identified through machine learning algorithms. The choice of algorithm and parameters for anomaly detection is entirely dependent on the system creator or domain expert's expertise. In situations where there are no labeled anomalies in the sample data, a common occurrence in the real world, selecting the appropriate algorithm for anomaly detection is not a straightforward task. The process of choosing an algorithm for anomaly detection tasks can be automated using an automated machine learning system (AutoML) that suggests an algorithm for anomaly detection based on data and meta-features. An increasing number of research papers are highlighting AutoML frameworks, which are emerging as a promising solution for constructing complex machine learning models without the need for human expertise or assistance. The primary challenge in enabling AutoML frameworks to construct an efficient model for anomaly detection tasks is to identify the most suitable underlying model for a given task and optimization metric. Meta-learning approaches based on a set of meta-features that describe data properties can facilitate efficient model selection in AutoML frameworks. Existing meta-learning approaches that rely on statistical and information-theoretic meta-features necessitate large amounts of data and computational resources to extract data properties. This doctoral dissertation focuses on the development of a flexible system for extracting meta-features based on domain-specific knowledge. The aim is to evaluate the proposed set of meta-features by comparing existing solutions through various complexity aspects against the proposed solution. Additionally, the aim is to design experiments and obtain results that can be utilized in future automated machine learning research. Based on the evaluation of experimental results, the proposed meta-features have been shown to achieve an accuracy of 87% and fulfill the critical requirements for application in AutoML systems, while existing solutions have an accuracy of 73%. In situations where there is a lack of significant datasets available for evaluation, the proposed solution performs 25% worse than existing solutions. The research's significance lies in the potential to implement AutoML systems based on the proposed set of meta-features. In situations where there is no sample data with labeled anomalies, or data is absent, the data creator or domain expert will be able to effectively characterize the anomalies in the data, based on domain-specific knowledge.
