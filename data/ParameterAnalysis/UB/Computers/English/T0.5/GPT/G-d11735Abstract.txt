The field of digital image compression and coding is primarily concerned with reducing the memory resources necessary for displaying, storing, and transmitting digital images. The utilization of compression techniques can lead to significant resource savings. The creation of rapid algorithms and architectural designs for compression and decompression is crucial in applications that demand real-time performance. However, current high compression ratio techniques for digital image compression are slow, necessitating complex processors and large amounts of high bandwidth memory, while also increasing power consumption. As the compression ratio increases, so do the processing time and memory capacity. In this doctoral thesis, we tackled the challenge of developing a codec hardware that minimizes the memory resources needed, operates quickly, and achieves a high compression ratio. This was achieved through the use of combined scientific methods. Optimized nonstationary filters and a novel two-dimensional subband transformation algorithm were used to minimize the required memory resources, along with a single-pass realization of probability estimators. The operation speed was achieved through a single-pass algorithm for probability estimation, and by ensuring the input image was not partially processed. The high compression ratio was achieved through the combined effects of all subsystems in the realization: the subband transformer, quantizer, single-pass probability estimator, and entropy encoder. The hardware realization from this dissertation was confirmed through an image compression system with a network interface. The research demonstrates that it is feasible to implement a complete color image encoder within an affordable programmable logic device, without the need for external memory components.
