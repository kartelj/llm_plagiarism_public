Three-dimensional (3D) videos are becoming more prevalent in both wired and wireless networks, leading to a significant increase in network load due to their high data content. This effect of 3D video on network traffic necessitates the development of improved methods to manage this type of data. The focus of this thesis is the fractal and multifractal analysis of 3D video formats. The primary objectives are to demonstrate that 3D video possesses fractal and multifractal characteristics, describe these characteristics, compare them across different 3D formats, and explore potential applications in traffic modeling of 3D video formats and the advancement of enhanced transport techniques for video smoothing and statistical multiplexing. Algorithms and software implementations for mathematical methods in the field of complex systems and chaos were created in Matlab and Python to determine fractal properties (using the aggregated variance method, the R/S statistic method, and the multiscale method) and multifractal properties (using the method of moments for multifractal spectra and estimation of the generalized dimensions and the histogram method for multifractal spectra and inverse multifractal analysis). The findings confirm the fractal and multifractal properties of 3D video formats and provide a comparison for various 3D video formats, video structures, frame types, encoder quantization parameter values, frame aggregation, and video streaming methods.
