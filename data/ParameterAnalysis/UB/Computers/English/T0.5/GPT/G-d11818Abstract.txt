This dissertation suggests merging two distinct study areas, information systems and operational research, by utilizing various soft computing and optimization methods in the service-oriented approach to contemporary software development. Service-orientation is a new generation strategy for creating distributed applications and automating business processes, proven to enhance business efficiency, agility, and productivity, and thus widely accepted. It operates on the principle that independently developed software components or services (which may be created on diverse platforms and in different programming languages) can be combined flexibly and dynamically to compose distributed applications. This service-oriented paradigm results in services that can be used in a variety of applications as their functionality is not tied to a specific business process. Web services, which are independent software components available on the internet providing certain functionality, are the leading approach for implementing modern service-oriented software solutions due to their adherence to widely accepted standards. As web services offering similar functionality proliferate (since they are independently developed and published on the internet), the challenge of selecting the best one from a vast collection grows increasingly crucial. Non-functional properties of services (Quality of Service - QoS) thus become vital in the selection process. Moreover, the selection usually considers multiple non-functional characteristics that are highly heterogeneous. The task becomes even more complex when the desired functionality cannot be achieved by a single service but requires a combination of services, each contributing a portion of the desired functionality. A service composition, which is an aggregation of services working together to automate a specific task or business process, can utilize existing services to meet new business demands or automate new business processes in a more cost-effective and less effortful way. The web service selection problem for a composition involves choosing actual services for each component of the composition so that the resulting composition meets the desired functional requirements and is optimal in terms of relevant QoS requirements. The overall performance of the composite service should be the basis for service selection for a composition. Aggregating QoS values to compute the overall QoS for a web service composition is a main challenge, as the nature of the aggregation depends on the selected QoS attributes and the actual composition structure. In addition, there are often given constraints regarding the required QoS levels of the composition. This thesis critically reviews existing modeling approaches and discusses their shortcomings. To address these issues, two new models are proposed that do not require the assignment of arbitrary preferences or the normalization of QoS values. The aim is also to allow users to more adequately specify the trade-offs they might be willing to make, which can usually only be formulated as complex verbal statements. Therefore, the application of Boolean consistent fuzzy logic is first proposed, as it allows for the expression of complex verbal statements in the form of logical demands defined in the Boolean frame. A second novel approach is proposed for situations when there are no logical demands regarding the relevant criteria but the criteria are heterogeneous and expressed using several measurement units. In such cases, the problem can be modeled as a discrete multi-objective fractional programming problem (MOFP). An innovative approach combining the Analytical Hierarchy Process method (AHP) and Boolean consistent fuzzy logic is proposed for selecting services for a particular functionality based on logical demands regarding the QoS criteria. Given that certain criteria may influence or be influenced by other criteria, and that the importance of the criteria may vary based on the demonstrated level of other criteria, it is proposed that logical functions could be used to account for these relationships. The illustrative examples indicate that the conventional and consistent fuzzy approaches can lead to the choice of different alternatives. For the selection of services for a composition, several methods are proposed. First, an adaptation of an existing exact method for solving the posed MOFP problem is presented. For larger, time-critical problems, such as the dynamic selection of services, the use of heuristic methods is advocated. The well-known Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS) metaheuristic is applied for the first time for the selection of services. A novel metaheuristic based on tabu search and VNS is also presented. Both methods can be used for solving both the MMKP (Multi-dimensional Multiple-choice 0-1 Knapsack Problem) model and the proposed model based on consistent fuzzy logic. A novel method for generating an initial feasible solution of the MMKP problem is also proposed. The validation of the proposed approaches is supported by a specially developed software solution. Finally, the possibility of a broader application of the proposed approaches is discussed.
