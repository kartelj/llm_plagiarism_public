The known issue of accessing pixels in memory, which slows down the performance of Single-Instruction Multiple-Data (SIMD) processors used in image and video processing, is addressed in this dissertation. A new parallel on-chip memory subsystem is suggested, which includes innovative features and a supportive architecture. This subsystem allows for greater processing speed and uses less energy per pixel compared to other current subsystems.

The dissertation initially presents innovative features of a parallel memory subsystem, such as new block and row access modes, which are more suited to the requirements of image and video processing algorithms than existing subsystems. These new modes significantly decrease the number of on-chip memory read and write accesses, thus speeding up the imaging/video kernels in focus: sub-pixel block-matching motion estimation, pixel interpolation for motion compensation, and spatial window-based filtering. The primary concept of these new modes is to take advantage of spatial overlaps in the memory subsystem, known at the design stage, and combine multiple accesses into one by accessing slightly more pixels at a time than with other parallel memories. To avoid the need for a wider, more expensive SIMD datapath, this work suggests new memory read operations that split all accessed pixels into multiple SIMD-wide blocks/rows, which is more convenient for further processing. The new modes also decrease the energy consumed by the parallel memory subsystem for the same amount of processed pixels by reducing repeated access of the same pixels.

The dissertation also provides a proof of concept and completes the proposed solution by describing a parametric, scalable and cost-efficient architecture that supports the new access modes and existing parallel memory subsystem modes. The architecture is based on a previously proposed set of memory banks with multiple pixels per addressable word of a bank, a shifted scheme for arranging pixels in the banks enabling parallel access to all pixels of a block/row, and control logic that implements the shifted scheme in the memory banks and the access modes, providing a convenient and efficient programming interface.

The benefits of the proposed parallel memory subsystem are demonstrated both analytically and experimentally through a case study of the well-known 3DRS sub-pixel block-matching motion estimation algorithm, commonly used for real-time frame-rate conversion during video playback. The block-matcher developed using the proposed parallel memory subsystem can process 3840*2160 video at 60 frames per second, while clocked at 600 MHz. Compared to block-matcher implementations based on six current subsystems and the same SIMD datapath, this work results in 40 – 70% higher throughput, 17 – 44% less energy consumption, and similar silicon area and off-chip memory bandwidth costs. This equates to 1.8 – 2.9 times more efficiency than the previous state-of-the-art, calculated as the ratio between the achieved processing throughput and the product of all costs: energy consumption, silicon area, and off-chip memory bandwidth. This high level of efficiency is due to the new access modes and the cost-effective architecture, which reduced the number of on-chip memory accesses by 1.6 – 2.1 times.

Due to its demonstrated efficiency, the proposed parallel memory subsystem is utilized in the most recent and advanced Intel processors and systems-on-chip for image and video processing on mobile devices. It is also continuously being improved for use in future generations of Intel processors.
