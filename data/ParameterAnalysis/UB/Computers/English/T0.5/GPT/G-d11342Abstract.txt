Conducting business in the contemporary setting involves managing relationships with a multitude of stakeholders. Establishing positive relationships with these stakeholders is considered a primary objective for businesses, as a stable network of business relationships is viewed as a vital asset for any company. Communication plays a crucial role in these relationships, making strategic or corporate communications an essential component of the company-stakeholder relationship. These communications aim to build and position the corporate brand, as confirmed in the dissertation.

The role of corporate communications in relationship management is to coordinate and manage all company communications. The concept of corporate branding is of great interest to both academics and industry professionals, as it has been demonstrated to influence business outcomes. It is viewed as a significant source of sustained competitiveness and a critical component of corporate strategy.

In this context, the positioning of the corporate brand is seen as the company's overall approach relative to its competitors, or how stakeholders perceive the company in comparison to its competitors. After examining the existing literature on positioning and its application to the corporate brand, this dissertation explores the specifics, types, and framework of corporate brand positioning.

Utilizing scientific and professional literature and analyzing empirical research results, a strategic framework for managing corporate communications is established for the purpose of positioning the corporate brand. The author's empirical research has led to the creation of a model of corporate brand positioning and the establishment of a measure called the Corporate Brand Positioning Score (CBPS).

The research identified and measured business aspects that impact corporate brand positioning among six citizens/business communities, the level of impact of certain business aspects on corporate brand positioning, and determined the model and measure of corporate brand positioning among citizens/business communities. It also identified how demographic characteristics of citizens, or business community characteristics, influence the strength of the connection between the perception of certain business aspects and corporate brand positioning.

The research revealed that the perception of all defined components like perception position, attitude towards the company, social responsibility, management, and companies/products, influence the positioning of the corporate brand among Serbian citizens to varying degrees. In modeling the corporate brand positioning and determining the CBPS for the business community, characteristics of the corporate brand were used, which due to terminology consistency with previous research are referred to as determinants. These include reliability, neutrality, efficiency, independence, adherence to principles, good employee relations, social responsibility, understanding smaller companies, professionalism, and credibility.

From the perspective of corporate brand positioning, nurturing these identified determinants is crucial as their values impact the CBPS. The research findings highlight aspects that are important for positioning the corporate brand among citizens and the business community and provide a foundation for strategic communications with stakeholders.
