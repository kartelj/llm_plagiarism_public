In the introductory section, we establish our research area and primary objectives, highlight key hypotheses and research methods, and give an overview and detailed description of the dissertation, focusing on significant elements of our work. The second section is devoted to the concept of efficiency and methods for assessing and measuring it. The efficiency principle is a crucial component of modern business decision-making (Savić, 2011). Efficiency is defined as the ability to reduce inputs to achieve maximum results (Amado et al., 2011). For organizations using one input to define one output, efficiency is measured as the output divided by the input. However, the challenge arises when measuring the efficiency of organizational systems that use various types of inputs to produce different outputs (Thanassoulis et al., 2012). The main aim of this research was to develop a new statistical model of efficiency that can address issues with different types of input/output variables. Therefore, it is necessary to consolidate all indicators into a single value. The problem is how to overcome the fact that variables are measured in different units and how to provide appropriate weighting factors. One of the commonly used methods, Data Envelopment Analysis – DEA, developed by Charnes, Cooper & Rhodes (1978), will be explained. This method was designed to measure the efficiency of organizational units, particularly non-profit ones. The creator of this method suggested a nonparametric approach to efficiency evaluation. The approach was based on the idea of integrating multiple inputs and outputs into one virtual input and output. The issue of weighting was solved by allowing each Decision Making Unit (DMU) to determine its own weights, all with the aim of maximizing its efficiency. The only constraint was that weights had to be positive and that the quotient of virtual outputs and virtual inputs could not exceed 1 (Martić, 1999). Besides the DEA method for measuring efficiency, the dissertation also elaborates on Stochastic Frontier Analysis (SFA). This is an alternative approach to measuring efficiency with an extended application of econometrics models. In the third chapter, the focus shifts to the concept of multivariate data analysis. This term refers to the multivariate aspect of data analysis, where many observations are collected on a large number of variables. Multivariate data analysis allows us to analyze complex data sets, with many interdependent and independent variables. The third chapter of the dissertation is primarily focused on two key statistical methods: principal component analysis (PCA) & factor analysis, and cluster analysis. Factor analysis and PCA are most commonly used to identify a relatively small number of factors that represent complex interrelationships between all variables. These methods are very useful in identifying hidden dimensions of the observed phenomenon. The main difference between these two methods is their approach to data examination. Factor analysis is mostly concerned with covariance, while PCA examines variances. Both have similar goals and procedures, so factor analysis can be seen as a special case of PCA (Bulajić, 2002). Also, significant attention is given to cluster analysis as a method of multivariate data analysis. It is frequently used to group objects, so similar objects form a group that differs from other groups. Objects are clustered based on similarity, which is defined in many different ways. The basic idea of the dissertation was to create a new statistical efficiency model based on the I-distance method. Therefore, the fourth chapter focuses on the I-distance metrics in the n-dimensional space, proposed and defined by prof. dr Branislav Ivanović (Ivanović 1972, 1973, 1977; Ivanović & Fanchette, 1973). As one of the leading experts in the Statistical department of the United Nations (UN) and its agencies such as UNCTAD and FAO (United Nations Conference on Trade and Development – UNCTAD; Food and Agriculture Agency - FAO), prof. Ivanović created this method with the aim of ranking countries according to a large number of variables. Several different socio-economic indicators were considered, and the key issue was how to use all of them to create a single synthesized indicator that would represent the rank. The proposed solution was based on the creation of a fictitious entity, one with the minimum values for each indicator/variable, and measuring the distance of other entities in the observed data set from the fictitious entity. With the help of the coefficient of partial correlation, a rank list is formed. I-distance fulfills all 13 conditions to be declared as a metric. A key argument for the use of the I-distance method is its ability to integrate a large number of different measure variables into a single value. In the dissertation, special attention was paid to the applications of the I-distance method. Probably the most significant one was the use of the I-distance method in the issue of ranking the world's best universities according to the Academic Ranking of World Universities – ARWU and SCImago methodologies (Scopus Journal Ranking). The improved I-distance method was highlighted as a major contribution to the issue, as it easily overcomes the problem of subjectively given weighting factors for variables/indicators. In addition to these applications, the dissertation presents the issue of evaluating the socio-economic development of countries, the evaluation of the health of nations, and the ranking of sports teams. All of these case studies have been verified in leading scientific journals. The fifth chapter is based on the new statistical efficiency model based on the I-distance method. In the dissertation, this model is called Distance Based Analysis – DBA, and is validated through many examples published in leading journals. The DBA method was applied to the issue of university scientific output efficiency, banking sector efficiency, health sector efficiency, and the efficiency of regions in Serbia. The proposed method provided us with interesting results and insights, which were later checked with the DEA method. The dissertation significantly improved the corpus of methods for measuring efficiency. Also, the dissertation made significant progress regarding the I-distance method, as the algorithm for selecting the first solution of the method and the order of variable inclusion was significantly improved. Since the idea of the I-distance method is to integrate many different types of measurement variables into a single value, it is essential that the maximum amount of information is covered by the I-distance. In the dissertation, we showed that the initial solution based on the sum of absolute correlations converges to the final solution fairly quickly. The suggested improved method provides us with better results, as the obtained solution incorporates the maximum amount of input variables/indicators. The improvement of the method is reflected in the fewer steps needed for the final solution to appear. Finally, a conclusion with responses to each research issue and hypothesis was provided. The scientific contributions were systematically arranged, and possibilities for further research were also elaborated. Extensive literature is provided and in the Appendix results concerning the I-distance method improvement experiment were provided.
