The initial portion of this thesis delves into an examination of routing protocols within data center topologies, with a particular focus on two-phase routing protocols. These protocols are instrumental in preventing congestion within regular data center topologies that offer a multitude of alternative paths. This thesis introduces a new two-phase routing algorithm, LB-ECR, which optimizes the use of data center networks. Through the application of linear programming, LB-ECR enhances the loss-free throughput in relation to the specified traffic requirements of the switches. LB-ECR is grounded in ECMP routing, a common feature in data centers due to its capacity to utilize alternative equal-cost paths. The two-phase balancing simplifies the linear model by eradicating traffic flows and reducing congestion risks by spreading traffic across less busy links. This simplification makes the linear model easier to solve for larger data centers. The opening segment of this thesis offers a summary of network topologies and data center routing, as well as a performance comparison of various routing algorithms within typical data center topologies.

Furthermore, this thesis explores algorithms used to update Internet routers' lookup tables. The second segment of this thesis provides a summary of the lookup and update algorithms. It scrutinizes the updating performance of two sophisticated lookup algorithms. We establish formulas for the maximum memory requirements for two quick lookup algorithms and demonstrate the memory requirements for typical routing tables through simulations. We also assess the number of memory accesses to the lookup modules during updates, the complexity of the updating algorithms, and their execution time for typical routing tables.

The final segment of this thesis entails a description of the implementation of the two-phase routing algorithms and the lookup update algorithms. It also discusses the integration of these components within the router.
