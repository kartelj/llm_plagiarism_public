The thesis focuses on online frontier-based strategies for environmental exploration, utilizing the D* Lite algorithm for robotic path planning and employing multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) methods to determine the next position. The decision-making process uses criteria such as collision-free path length, anticipated information gain, and distance from the base station. The average robot path traveled was used to gauge exploration efficiency, in relation to various starting positions, for 90% environmental exploration. Matlab simulations demonstrated that under specified conditions, the TOPSIS method outperforms the other two MCDM methods (SAW and COPRAS), and four conventional strategies from literature, in exploring complex environments. This advantage is attributed to TOPSIS' ability to maximize Euclidean distance from the worst hypothetical solution, thereby minimizing decision-making risk in complex environments. These key findings were validated using the Gazebo 3D simulator and the Robot Operating System. The thesis also suggests two strategies to enhance robotic path planning in search and rescue missions. The first uses the D* Lite algorithm with fuzzy logic to dictate map cell cost for robot path planning, avoiding binary values. This enables prioritized object coverage and prevents mapping robots from interfering with others. The second strategy combines the D* Lite algorithm with online learning to shorten the mapping robot's path and minimize risky movements, as obstacle avoidance maneuvers are executed before a potential encounter.
