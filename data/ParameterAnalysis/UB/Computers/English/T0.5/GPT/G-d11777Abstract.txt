A data warehouse serves as the foundation for the execution of business intelligence systems, data amalgamation, and decision support. Typically, a dimensional model is constructed for the data warehouse to enhance data visualization. The architecture of a data warehouse outlines the basic elements of a data warehouse and illustrates the connection and structure of these elements. 

There are two predominant approaches in data warehouse architecture. The first, known as Corporate Information Factory (CIF) architecture, is advocated by Bill Inmon who asserts that a data warehouse should be normalized and contain atomic data in the third normal form. The second approach, known as BUS architecture, is supported by Ralph Kimball who believes that a warehouse should also possess a multi-dimensional structure. 

Daniel Linstedt designed the Data Vault concept of a data warehouse, which is a detail-oriented, historically tracked, and uniquely connected group of normalized tables that support one or more functional areas of a business. This hybrid approach combines the best features from the third normal form (3NF) and the star scheme. The Data Vault concept highlights the importance of tracking the source and timing of data entry into the database and allows for easy modifications in the data warehouse structure in response to changes in the business environment. 

Data warehouses are constructed using various methodological approaches. However, there is a challenge with the fact that the process of data warehouse design and the associated dimensional model is not automated. This dissertation addressed the issue of data warehouse design process based on a comprehensive analysis of literature and explored the potential for automating the physical data warehouse design based on the Data Vault concept, with minimal user interaction. 

The study presents a simple algorithm for automating the physical design of a data warehouse, using the Data Vault concept, and a data model with metadata transactional data sources and rules. The algorithm formalizes, generalizes, and largely automates the process of physical design for data warehouses based on a physical model of structured, semi-structured, and simple non-structured data sources. 

The relational model is a common factor for both Data Vault implementation and original data, which is why all types are abstracted with a meta-model. The direct approach implies that the Physical Data Vault (PDV) is directly realized based on the physical data source model in a relational form. 

The conceptualization of metadata is presented with a physical data model that, with minor adjustments, can be utilized in the design of individual data warehouses, representing the fundamental methodological contribution of this study. Furthermore, this study provides a comprehensive integrated approach to the automation of data warehouse design as it enables the design of data marts and related ETL processes. This approach facilitates the integration of all activities necessary for the complete realization of a data warehouse. 

Based on the research findings, a prototype application for supporting the physical design of a data warehouse was developed. Experiments with the algorithm, using a prototype of the design automation application, in a real-world healthcare insurance scenario yielded satisfactory results.
