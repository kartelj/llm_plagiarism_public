E-learning is a multifaceted system that encompasses remote learning, lectures, and various electronic classroom materials. It incorporates both individual and group learning processes, tutoring, and interactive work. The rapid and substantial growth in users, services, educational content, and necessary resources presents new optimization challenges for educational institutions and their e-learning systems. These challenges include managing dynamic competitiveness and controlling system expenses. Consequently, the demands for the development and implementation of IT infrastructure for e-learning systems have become increasingly complex. By utilizing modern information and communication technologies, the efficiency, flexibility, and cost-effectiveness of these e-learning systems can be enhanced. The introduction of IT infrastructure models for e-learning based on the contemporary IT concept of Cloud Computing can improve the reliability, scalability, and cost-effectiveness of the educational process system. However, the lack of scientific support in applying the Cloud Computing concept in modeling the IT infrastructure of higher education in the Republic of Serbia, coupled with the strategic importance of this concept, highlights the need for theoretical support for its more efficient development and application. The dissertation research presented here focuses on defining and developing plans for higher education institutions related to the development of an IT infrastructure model for e-learning using the Cloud Computing concept. Higher education institutions face many challenges in providing services to students and research staff, particularly in the areas of digital identity and access management. The primary challenge is encouraging the adoption and implementation of digital identity management systems. A successful IT infrastructure for managing digital identities requires a systematic approach to identities and their interdependence. The next challenge is supporting a system capable of leveraging the benefits of federated digital identity management systems. Developing such federations among educational institutions facilitates user, content, and service mobility. The central hypothesis formulated and substantiated in the doctoral thesis is that the application of a developed IT infrastructure model can enhance the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of e-learning systems. The experimental portion of the doctoral thesis involves research aimed at validating the proposed IT infrastructure model for e-learning. This research was conducted at the E-Business Laboratory at the Faculty of Organizational Sciences. The research results indicate that the implemented IT infrastructure model has made the e-learning system more efficient, flexible, and economical.
