Current trends in computer design aim to elevate the performance of computer systems to the utmost level to cater to the demand for processing vast data volumes. The design of the processor, being the key player in the data processing process, is the main focus. However, the anticipated improvements in processor performance, as per Moore's Law, have been witnessing a slowdown due to the physical constraints of semiconductor technology, making it increasingly challenging to enhance performance. Various techniques are being explored to offset this issue, focusing on performance improvement without escalating transistor and power usage. 

This thesis explores asymmetric multicore processors with transactional memory support. Two novel techniques have been proposed to enhance the performance of these processors. The first technique aims to mitigate transaction congestion resulting from high parallelism by shifting transactions to a faster core. The transactions that significantly contribute to congestion are selected for this migration. Running them on a faster core reduces their conflict potential with other transactions, thereby increasing the likelihood of avoiding congestion. 

The second technique modifies the cache subsystem to cut down on cache access latency and the chances of false conflicts, while also reducing the number of transistors needed for cache implementation. This can be achieved by employing small and straightforward caches. Detailed proposals for implementing both techniques are provided. 

Prototypes of these techniques were created using the Gem5 simulator, which provides a detailed model of the processor's system. These prototypes were evaluated by simulating a wide range of applications from a standard benchmark set for transactional memory using these prototypes. The simulation results analysis provided insights into how and when the proposed techniques should be utilized.
