This doctoral thesis delves into the potential applications of virtual worlds in research and education. It specifically explores two key aspects. The first aspect reviews the idea of autonomous agents and the general agent theory in the context of virtual worlds. The second aspect investigates the educational applications of virtual worlds, with a particular emphasis on virtual laboratories. The thesis begins with an introduction to the fundamental terminology related to the subject. It then proceeds to a comprehensive analysis of the role of agents in virtual worlds, including the techniques that influence the agent's behavior. The thesis also presents the development of a virtual gamified educational system dedicated to agents, providing a detailed description. Lastly, it analyzes the concept of virtual laboratories in Science, Technology, and Engineering (STE) disciplines, assessing existing solutions based on the criteria defined in the thesis.
