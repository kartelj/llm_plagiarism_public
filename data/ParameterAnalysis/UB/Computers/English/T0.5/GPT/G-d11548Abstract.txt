High-quality telecommunication networks are fundamental to the advancement of modern society, necessitating their high availability for user services. Presently, these backbone networks comprise numerous nodes, making it challenging to directly compute network availability due to the exponential increase in algorithm execution time with the rise in nodes and links. Hence, approximation algorithms are practically significant in defining initial conditions for network topology design.

This PhD thesis introduces a new method for approximating the maximum availability of intricate telecommunication networks. To derive maximum availability values, a network synthesis method was developed, with a chain serving as the starting network topology. The first synthesis step involves forming a ring, followed by the sequential addition of links to the network topology to achieve maximum all-terminal availability.

The network is synthesized by adding one link at a time, where all links have identical availability, ensuring maximum availability at each step given the number of nodes, links, and link availability. Approximation functions for maximum network availability are derived through an analysis of the network synthesis method results for networks with maximum availability.

The network's availability limits, which are dependent on its topology, can be calculated using the approximation functions. These functions can also define the boundaries for the number of links required to achieve the desired network availability. It is demonstrated that for maximum network availability, all nodes should have equal connectivity, varying by one at most. With a predetermined limit on the number of network links, the network design process can be completed in several iterations to achieve the required availability.

The runtime of the approximation functions defined in this dissertation is independent of network size, allowing for extensive calculations and analysis of numerous combinations of input parameters. The approximation functions defined in this thesis have proven to be more accurate than previously published functions. A comparison of calculated approximate values with exact availability values shows that the relative approximation error is significantly less than 1% for networks with link availability exceeding 0.75.
