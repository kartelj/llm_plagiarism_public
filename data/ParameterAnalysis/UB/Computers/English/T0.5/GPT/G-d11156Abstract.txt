The aim of this thesis is to demonstrate and elucidate how decision-making can be enhanced in choosing the most economically viable bidder in public e-procurement. This choice is guided by specific criteria set by the buyer in public e-procurement. The selection process is straightforward when there are only a few bidders and when there are established quantitative criteria for comparison. Nevertheless, real-world scenarios often involve a large number of bidders, and the choice of the most suitable among them is based on both qualitative and quantitative criteria. The primary hypothesis of this thesis, which has been validated within the doctoral research framework, is that the application of multi-criteria decision-making methods and fuzzy set theory can enhance the selection of the most economically viable bidder in public e-procurement, especially when both qualitative and quantitative criteria are used. In such a selection process, it is feasible to ascertain the values linked to the output variable that corresponds to the criteria weights belonging to a fuzzy set through a process called defuzzification. This involves choosing a single output variable value with the same quantification. Simultaneously, the thesis introduces a decision support system grounded in multi-criteria decision-making and fuzzy set theory. This system forms an integral part of the public e-procurement web portal, facilitating a collaborative work environment that seamlessly integrates buyers and providers into a unified virtual workspace for e-procurement.
