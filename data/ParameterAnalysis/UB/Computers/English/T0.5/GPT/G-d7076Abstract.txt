The research problem in this dissertation pertains to the overwhelming amount of data and dearth of information in business reporting systems. Despite being abundant in charts and tables, these reports merely contain data and its graphical representations, with little to no information. Users of these reports have to manually decipher the data, which can lead to missed crucial information due to excessive data, fatigue, lack of focus, insufficient knowledge or experience, subjectivity, or intentional neglect. This paper suggests automating the process of converting data into information, based on the concept that data becomes information when meaning is applied. This requires relevant knowledge to derive meaning from data. The proposed method involves using expert system techniques to automate the interpretation of key performance indicators. The information can be derived using forward chaining and fuzzy inference, and then translated into natural language sentences using canned text. The paper discusses the current situation in business intelligence and expert systems, and elaborates on the proposed approach, its potential pros and cons, and its implementation plan. The approach is demonstrated through a prototype application, PT (Enterprise Profit Interpretation Tutor), which allows for testing and validating the hypotheses. The application provides reports containing data and information in a comprehensible manner. An evaluation study involving students using PT as a teaching tool showed that the students found PT useful and relatively easy to use. However, they felt that the explanations in the reports could be more detailed. Most students felt that the PT application enhanced their knowledge and provided a quicker and more engaging way to learn profit interpretation. The paper also presents a comparative analysis of explanation facilities in modern tools for expert system and business rule development, and evaluates the JEFF explanation facility created for the prototype. The evaluation showed that almost all objectives were met and that JEFF is nearly as effective as the professional tool it was compared to. In conclusion, the hypotheses were validated, demonstrating that the proposed methods can be used successfully to create information. However, the approach has not been tested in a business environment. The prototype proves the feasibility of the approach, but its effectiveness was only evaluated as a teaching tool for students, not as a managerial tool for data interpretation. For practical application, it would be necessary to develop applications that cater to managers' needs in a business environment.
