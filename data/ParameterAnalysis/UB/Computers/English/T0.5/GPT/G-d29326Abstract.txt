The evolution of modern network environments, their uses, and their interplay with diverse technological concepts, hinge on the application and compatibility of various heterogeneous technologies. These intricate network environments are perpetually confronted with operational challenges, with the protection and security of services and data being a top priority. The continual growth in user numbers and the rapid development of new applications demanding high bandwidth have set new standards for security systems. These are rooted in monitoring and effectively comprehending network traffic characteristics. 

Given the escalating advancements in cyberattacks, continuous dynamic changes in network traffic, and the growing diversity of technologies and devices used, devising solutions for anomaly and attack detection has become essential. Despite numerous studies on network traffic flow analysis for performance and security monitoring purposes, only a few focus on creating network traffic behavior profiles or specific communication patterns. Network behavior analysis thus depends on understanding normal or acceptable behavior patterns, facilitating the effective detection of abnormal, anomalous behavior patterns. 

Contrary to intrusion detection systems based on packet payload or signature, this approach is not only beneficial for identifying unknown threats, zero-day attacks, and suspicious behavior, but also for enhancing overall network performance. This dissertation suggests a new method for detecting attacks and anomalies, which relies on profiling network traffic using only IP addresses and port numbers collected through the NetFlow protocol. 

The proposed solution involves a specific preprocessing of network traffic flows by applying entropy calculation to certain traffic flow attributes. Additional attributes are then calculated using aggregation techniques, reflecting the communication activity of participants in the observed time period. Further transformation of these attributes results in several characteristic signatures that describe network traffic profiles. 

Applying an enhanced hierarchical clustering algorithm, traffic instances are grouped according to these defined profiles. The dissertation offers a thorough review of the challenges in detecting and identifying anomalies and attacks in modern network environments and proposes a systematic solution, starting from defined hypotheses, analyzing network traffic flow characteristics, and suggesting a new solution combining different techniques. 

This includes preprocessing network traffic flows, calculating attribute value entropy, aggregating these values, generating specific network traffic profile signatures, and applying a modified hierarchical agglomerative clustering algorithm. The primary goal is to enable swift and efficient processing of real network environment data, especially when dealing with unlabeled, incomplete, and varying flow lengths. 

The proposed solution assumes that each data flow includes certain informational and volumetric attributes, while applying special aggregation techniques generates additional behavioral attributes. Like entropy-based techniques, aggregation is applied to each data flow, with preprocessed attributes interpreted as a unique signature of the communication flow. The dissertation aims to find a method to enhance entropy-based techniques using various machine learning algorithms, proposing two new approaches.
