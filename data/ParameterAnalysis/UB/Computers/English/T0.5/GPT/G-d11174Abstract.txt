Managerial control is viewed as a crucial tool for management, executing corporate strategies, and enhancing a company's business performance. The effectiveness of this control largely hinges on the information available to decision-makers, including past performance data and future projections of an organization's position and earnings. Systems for business performance measurement study these aspects. Thus, developing a new or implementing an existing business performance measurement system is vital for successful decision-making. 

To meet management's information needs, managerial accountants and experts from various managerial fields have worked to establish principles, concepts, techniques, and procedures for developing business performance measurement systems. Current research also tackles the challenges of creating specific business performance measurement systems. Despite over a decade of focus on these issues, the development and use of business performance measurement systems are still in their early stages. Therefore, both academia and management practice view them as a hot topic, sparking lively debate on the optimal system for business performance measurement. 

This doctoral thesis aims to build a new system for business performance measurement. The specific goal is to identify the factors that influence the system's construction, including the number of performance measures to be included in the system and how the system should be used. The dissertation is grounded in the contingency theory of management accounting, identifying a series of factors that determine the diversity and usage of the performance measurement system. 

The study then examined the impact of performance measurement systems on organizational success, both financial and non-financial. Primary data from empirical research were used to validate the theoretical model. As far as the author is aware, this type of study has never been conducted in Serbia before. Outside Serbia, only partial tests of a contingency factor's influence on business performance systems have been conducted, but never so comprehensively and in the format presented in this doctoral thesis. 

The results suggest that Serbian companies use a relatively broad range of performance measures. The factors defined in the theoretical model impact both the diversity and usage of performance measurement systems, although their significance varies greatly. Also, a balanced use of financial and non-financial performance indicators significantly influences business success. These findings could benefit other researchers in the fields of performance measurement, management control, and management accounting. Furthermore, the results are highly valuable for practitioners, such as consultants and managers, when building performance measurement systems in specific companies.
