Wireless mesh networks (WMNs) are an emerging trend in wireless communications, offering enhanced flexibility, reliability, and superior network performance compared to conventional wireless local area networks. Given the escalating demand for swift and efficient data transfer, along with multimedia transmission (voice and video), the primary challenges in developing WMN include enhancing throughput (by incorporating a multi-channel multi-interface (MCMI) approach to the WMN), while considering the quality of service (QoS). To optimize network performance, it's crucial to establish protocols and routing metrics that identify the best path between the source and destination node. Considering the high signal dynamics of the WMN, particularly in complex environments such as indoors, this dissertation proposes routing metrics that can quickly adapt to changes in propagation conditions at each network link. The three new metrics, powerETX, powerWCETT, and powerMIC, incorporate a parameter dependent on the received signal level, in addition to the parameters defined in the existing metrics. Compared to existing metrics, these new ones offer increased data throughput, reduced average end-to-end delay, and can be implemented without additional hardware and minimal software modifications. Acknowledging that existing channel assignment (CA) algorithms lack QoS support in MCMI-WMNs and that multimedia transmission may experience unacceptable delays, this dissertation proposes a new QoS-HMCP protocol for link layer. This protocol introduces QoS support via the EDCA mechanism and leverages the benefits of the hybrid CA algorithm defined by the HMCP protocol for link layer. Four versions of the QoS-HMCP protocols are proposed, each considering different criteria for channel switching and medium competition procedure. These versions are compared to the basic HMCP protocol in terms of user data throughput and network delay, justifying the inclusion of QoS support in the MCMI network. Finally, the dissertation determines the best version of the QoS-HMCP protocol based on a comparative analysis, considering the highest throughput with the least delay, and the traffic categories and network conditions it is best suited for. Additionally, this dissertation offers a comprehensive review of existing routing protocols, channel assignment strategies, and routing metrics for multi-channel multi-interface WMNs.
