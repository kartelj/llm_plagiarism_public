The rise of international operations due to globalization has led to an increased emphasis on the management of intellectual capital. It is widely believed that effective management of intellectual capital is crucial to an organization's success. Intellectual capital has become a key resource and foundation for modern organizations. The concept of intellectual capital gained prominence in the early 20th century, and its study has significantly boosted an organization's market value compared to its book value. Unlike tangible assets, which depreciate over time, the proper utilization of intellectual capital can enhance an organization's value. 

Management is expected to identify and capitalize on opportunities and strengths in the face of significant environmental changes, while minimizing or eliminating weaknesses. This approach fosters organizational growth and development. Intellectual capital, which includes human capital, structural and relational capital, has both operational and strategic implications for an organization. 

Today, organizations are increasingly interested in managing intellectual capital, which encompasses not only organizational knowledge but also staff competencies, organizational structure, business processes, intellectual property, and corporate culture. Both internal and external resources, such as relationships with customers, suppliers, distributors, and other stakeholders, are also crucial. Intellectual capital includes factors not accounted for in official financial statements, but which contribute to the creation of organizational value. The qualitative aspect of intellectual capital is more important than the quantitative, as it creates added value. 

Intellectual capital serves as a guide for future dynamic environmental changes. This thesis aims to investigate how organizations identify, evaluate, and report intellectual capital. It includes a review of relevant literature on intellectual capital and previous studies on its management in organizations. The empirical research within the thesis discusses the concept of intellectual capital in Serbian organizations and its importance for financial reporting. The study confirms the thesis hypothesis that providing an adequate intellectual capital position is a leading performance indicator in the modern age, with the goal of ensuring comprehensive information. 

The final conclusion emphasizes the need for intellectual capital valuation and its inclusion in an additional financial statement for the most accurate representation of an organization's value. The current set of financial statements and quantitative indicators do not provide a sufficiently precise scope for presenting necessary information, so quantified non-financial elements or descriptive forms can contribute to a clearer understanding of an organization's value and potential.
