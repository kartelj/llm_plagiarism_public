This dissertation outlines a model for interoperable e-business statistical systems, leveraging service-oriented architecture and web services. The research is tailored for implementation within the statistical system of the Republic of Serbia. Official statistics, a crucial component of any democratic society's information system, provides data on economic, demographic, social, and environmental conditions. The primary objective of official statistics is to accurately depict socio-economic trends within a country, thereby providing a reliable foundation for analysis and decision-making across various sectors, including government, institutions, businesses, and citizens. The Republic of Serbia's official statistics operate on principles outlined in the UN Economic-Social Council's document on basic principles of official statistics, as well as the European Commission's Practical Codex of European Statistics. Most countries have one or more National Statistical Institutes (NSIs) that collectively form the country's national statistical system. These systems primarily collect, store, analyze and provide statistical data to various user groups. Within each NSI, statistical production is carried out across different production lines and processes for various statistical areas. Typically, NSIs' business architecture is based on the stove-pipe model, where each statistical area within the NSI has an independent production line. Each domain undergoes its own production process, from research planning to data collection and analysis, independently of other domains, possessing its own data, sources, and users. The electronic exchange of statistical data is a prevalent communication method amongst statistical services, but often encounters issues of interoperability and data conversion. This dissertation suggests the adoption of universal standards for statistical data sharing and exchange, with the primary objective of establishing widely acceptable standards to facilitate rapid and immediate access to data and metadata. The service-oriented architecture of the statistical information system promotes interoperability at both the application and business process levels. Semantic level interoperability is achieved through the design of a common domain ontology and the development of a common data model based on this domain ontology.
