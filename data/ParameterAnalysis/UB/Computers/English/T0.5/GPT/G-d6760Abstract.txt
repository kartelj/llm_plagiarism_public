This thesis explores the use of contemporary software engineering techniques in the development of open-source software for intelligent systems. The primary outcomes include a universal model for software frameworks and guidelines for managing open-source projects within this domain. These framework models and project management recommendations were established and tested in a real-world setting through the enhancement of a chosen software framework for neural networks. The selected neural network framework is a leading open-source framework in Java. The proposed software development techniques can also be applied in other areas of intelligent systems. They address challenges and unique needs in this field, primarily arising from the fact that the software is often research-oriented but should also be practical and user-friendly despite its complexity. The suggested development techniques encompass requirements specification, planning, design, implementation, and maintenance. They are presented as proven best-practice recommendations. Besides these theoretical and methodological inputs, this thesis also offers a practical contribution by introducing new features for a selected framework in the field of intelligent systems, significantly improving its practical use.
