This research primarily aims to present and empirically analyze a comprehensive model of retail consumer loyalty in Serbia. The study began with a literature review of crucial factors influencing service customer loyalty, such as service quality, satisfaction, and perceived value. The research was conducted using a structured questionnaire on a convenience sample of 737 retail customers in non-specialized, predominantly food stores. Multivariate data analysis techniques were utilized, performed using SPSS 18 and LISREL 8.80 software packages. 

The results of exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis reveal the multi-faceted nature of the service quality construct in Serbian retail. Four dimensions of retail service quality were identified: (F1) Employee behavior and appearance, (F2) Atmospherics, (F3) Customer communication, and (F4) Spatial layout and assortment. 

Structural equation modeling revealed customer satisfaction as the most crucial determinant of customer loyalty, followed by perceived value, which had both a direct and indirect impact on loyalty, mediated via satisfaction. The findings also highlight the significant influence of service quality on customer loyalty. While this latent variable did not have a statistically significant direct impact on customer loyalty, it indirectly affected loyalty through the mediating variables of satisfaction and perceived value. 

The study underscores the need to measure and enhance customer satisfaction and perceived value, as well as service quality, to cultivate a loyal customer base. Future studies should focus on developing a service quality scale and measuring customer satisfaction and perceived value on a representative sample of Serbian retail customers, as this study was conducted on a convenience sample of retail customers.
