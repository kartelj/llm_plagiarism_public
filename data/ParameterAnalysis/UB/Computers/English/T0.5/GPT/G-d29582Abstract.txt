The expansion of data and devices has contributed to the swift advancement of technology and machine learning algorithms employed in data analysis and processing systems. The performance of these systems, which handle vast amounts of data, is determined by the quality of the data, the chosen algorithm, and the parameters of that algorithm. Data anomalies, which deviate from data distribution and impact data quality, can be identified through machine learning algorithms. The algorithm and parameters selected for anomaly detection are reliant on the expertise of the system developer or domain expert. 

Selecting the appropriate algorithm for anomaly detection can be a complex issue when there is no sample data with labeled anomalies, a common occurrence in real-world scenarios. This selection process can be automated using an automated machine learning system (AutoML), which suggests an algorithm for anomaly detection based on data and meta-features. A rising number of research papers highlight AutoML frameworks as a promising avenue for constructing intricate machine learning models without the need for human expertise or intervention. 

However, a significant challenge in utilizing AutoML frameworks to build an efficient model for anomaly detection tasks is determining the optimal underlying model for a given task and optimization metric. Meta-learning approaches, which rely on a set of meta-features that describe data properties, can facilitate efficient model selection in AutoML frameworks. Existing meta-learning approaches, which utilize statistical and information-theoretic meta-features, demand extensive data and computational resources to extract data properties. 

The focus of this doctoral dissertation is the creation of a flexible system to extract meta-features using domain-specific knowledge. The objective is to evaluate the suggested set of meta-features by comparing existing solutions in terms of complexity with the proposed solution. The aim is also to design experiments and obtain results that can inform future research in the area of automated machine learning. 

Experimental results indicate that the proposed meta-features achieve an accuracy of 87% and satisfy the crucial requirements for implementation in AutoML systems, while existing solutions reach an accuracy of 73%. In instances where there is a lack of substantial datasets for evaluation, the proposed solution's performance is 25% lower than that of existing solutions. 

The significance of this research lies in the potential to implement AutoML systems using the proposed set of meta-features. In situations where there is no sample data with labeled anomalies or no data present, the data creator or domain expert will be able to effectively characterize the anomalies in the data using domain-specific knowledge.
