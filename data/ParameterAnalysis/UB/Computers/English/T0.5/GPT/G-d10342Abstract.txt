Economies built on knowledge heavily rely on the adoption and application of knowledge to enhance their competitiveness. In such contexts, vast amounts of pertinent knowledge can be found both within and outside organizations. The ever-changing global market compels organizations to utilize their knowledge flows to meet their needs and gain a competitive edge. Organizations aim for continuous knowledge accumulation to enhance their business solutions and products, create new market opportunities, fortify their knowledge base, and anticipate market trends. This increases the significance of the concept of absorptive capacity, which pertains to an organization's ability to acquire, assimilate, transform and apply knowledge. Despite numerous studies examining the different aspects of absorptive capacity and their characteristics, this research focuses on the relationships between the dimensions and components of absorptive capacity and their impact on the absorptive capacity level of organizations in technology and knowledge-intensive industries. To this end, an absorptive capacity management model that tracks knowledge flow from acquisition to application has been developed and implemented. This model is centered on the division of absorptive capacity into dimensions and components. The outcomes of the model's application were scrutinized to investigate the potential impact of absorptive capacity on an organization's competitive power, the main hypothesis of this doctoral dissertation. The research employed both quantitative and qualitative methodologies based on a survey. The data collected were analyzed using the absorptive capacity evaluation model, with discriminant analysis serving as the statistical method. The research findings indicate the feasibility of analyzing the level of absorptive capacity through the model's indicators, and that the most influential determinant of absorptive capacity is the availability of relevant knowledge. The impact of absorptive capacity on an organization's competitiveness was determined using the principles of the Balanced Scorecard model. The research results suggest that it is possible to manage the determinants of absorptive capacity within the provided framework. This research's findings will enhance the understanding of the absorptive capacity framework in sectors heavily dependent on knowledge adoption and utilization for future growth, which is crucial for the competitiveness of knowledge-based economies, including Serbia, as per its strategic orientation. The developed model can assist management in the areas of organizational learning, and knowledge and innovation management.
