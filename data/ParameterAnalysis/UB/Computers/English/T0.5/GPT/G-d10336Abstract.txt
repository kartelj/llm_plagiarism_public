This paper introduces a unique approach for monitoring student engagement by leveraging Internet of Things (IoT) and machine learning algorithms. The key hypothesis validated in this doctoral thesis is that incorporating IoT in education can enhance teaching effectiveness. This is achieved by implementing a system that detects student engagement, which allows for the analysis of environmental parameters and the display of processed results. To provide additional understanding necessary for the execution of these processes and to justify the need for further study, a review of relevant computer and social science research has been conducted. This review includes a comparative analysis of smart classroom platforms, which serve as a conduit for these new algorithms to emerge and identify sociological contexts at the moment they arise. Sociological sciences play a crucial role in helping us comprehend the background of the sociological processes being observed and categorized. Therefore, a review of sociological sciences and social signals, in particular, is presented to wrap up the review of significant research and to guide the future execution of the proposed system. Furthermore, the review also outlines potential parameters and algorithms that could be employed, along with a description of the methodology for all research phases. Subsequently, the requirements of such a system are analyzed, and crucial features necessary for detection are identified, along with the sociological factors that impact these features. Pattern classification is performed using a machine learning method that necessitates a classifier based on a specific dataset. Prior to implementation, a system simulation is conducted on a dataset not used in the training process. The system demonstrated an average accuracy of 92.2% during the simulation. After the simulation, the system was implemented and its performance was evaluated by comparing real-time annotations (i.e., student feedback) with the system output during lectures. The system's average accuracy, evaluated across three different student groups, was 81.9%.
