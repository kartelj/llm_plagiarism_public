The routing strategy selected for a packet network greatly influences the reliability and overall data transmission quality. It also affects the utilization of various network resources, with poor routing decisions potentially causing network bottlenecks and limiting throughput. Network latency and cost are also dependent on the selected routing strategy. To determine the optimal routing strategy for a given network and anticipated traffic, routing optimization is conducted. The objective of this optimization is to achieve the best outcome for the selected network performance metric. The optimization could aim to maximize network throughput, minimize network cost, minimize latency, etc.

This paper aims to address the issues of maximizing network throughput and minimizing network cost. It focuses on non-blocking networks that ensure service to all traffic generating and receiving users within set boundaries, irrespective of the current traffic distribution. We propose a new routing scheme based on load balancing and shortest path routing, referred to as load balanced routing (LBR). This routing protocol can be optimized using linear programming to either minimize cost or maximize network throughput.

The proposed routing scheme is easily implementable as it modifies the widely used shortest path routing. The linear program's dimension and the optimization time are acceptable. The proposed routing guarantees service to a larger number of users than the regular shortest path routing and at a lower cost for servicing a given number of users.

We will first present the proposed load balanced routing and its optimization linear program. We will then evaluate the performance of the proposed routing scheme and compare it to the shortest path routing. Specifically, we will focus on two scenarios. In the first, we will optimize the load balanced routing to maximize network throughput. We will demonstrate that the proposed load balanced routing significantly enhances the guaranteed network throughput compared to the regular shortest path routing. In the second scenario, we will optimize the load balanced routing to achieve the network's minimum cost that can support given user demands. We will show that the network cost with load balanced routing is lower than that using shortest path routing.

We will conduct the analysis for both regular and realistic network topologies and networks requiring service reliability in the event of a single resource (link or router) failure. We will demonstrate that the proposed load balanced routing outperforms the shortest path routing in all these scenarios.
