The field of cloud computing has seen significant growth over the past ten years. This study assesses a variety of cloud environments and the services they offer to clients. Multiple issues have been identified in cloud usage, posing substantial challenges for users. Even before the advent of the cloud, users and administrators of relational databases faced numerous problems. With the advent of the cloud, issues like software updates for relational database services became the provider's responsibility, leading to reduced operational costs. However, the cloud environment's higher abstraction level and the increased number of relational databases led to escalated issues with service improvement and query optimizations. The cloud environment continuously collects detailed service usage data. A system is proposed that utilizes this data to help users understand the workings of the relational database and identify problem sources more easily. After a comprehensive analysis of related work, the system is meticulously designed and developed, featuring two types of statistical data models for recall and precision and an expert system for final decision-making. The system is built on a microservice architecture and implemented on the Microsoft Azure platform. The project team comprised various professionals with diverse skills. Specific details of the implementation are also shared. The system underwent thorough testing and evaluation using real data workload from the Azure SQL relational database's production environment over six months. The results indicated a significant improvement in query execution performance. Customer feedback revealed a considerable enhancement in user experience. The conclusion provides a project overview, suggests system improvement ideas, and discusses the potential application of a similar approach in scientific fields.
