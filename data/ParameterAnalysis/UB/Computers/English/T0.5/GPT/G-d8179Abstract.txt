The focus of this thesis is the evolution and utilization of an interoperable e-Business model for payment systems, founded on ontologies and the Resource-Event-Agent (REA) ontological framework (ISO/IEC 15944-4:2007). The research is grounded on referential models in the realm of global business standards for the financial sector. The study will leverage insights and expertise garnered from the deployment of the Check Clearing and Direct Debit systems within the Association of Serbian Banks, developed using Enterprise Integration Patterns (EIP) and standardized messaging systems. The research will be tailored towards the installation of interoperable payment systems in Serbia.

Multiple payment systems interact with various business systems during electronic transactions. These business systems cater to a vast user base and numerous business processes with unique requirements. A key challenge is the disparity between business processes, data, and IT technologies, leading to wasted resources in transferring data between systems. With the electronic exchange of financial transactions becoming the norm, there's a need for developing interoperable e-Business models for payment systems to facilitate these exchanges and their processing.

The standardization of payment system modeling, as explored in this study, should enhance the efficiency of other e-Business systems and improve the interoperability of participants' e-Businesses. In every country, the payment system includes a variety of payment methods, banking procedures, and systems for transferring funds between financial institutions, enabling money circulation. The Central Bank directly controls and guides the money flow, acting as the regulator of financial flows by overseeing the payment systems. The Real Time Gross Settlement System (RTGS) is of utmost importance and is primarily supervised by the Central Bank. The RTGS system connects the systems of banks and other financial institutions.

The thesis describes how payment systems unify various elements, such as those found in every message-based system, technological aspects of supervisory institutions, conditions imposed by the locale with the implemented payment system, required communication interaction, and necessary IT for accomplishing general and specific tasks. Ontologies, being explicit descriptions of objects, their attributes, and relationships in a specific domain, are comprehensible to both humans and computers. In this study, the ontological approach ensures interoperability and consistency in the model and enhances the model's design from the knowledge domain. The ISO 15944-4:2007 standard, which will be examined in this study, establishes the ontological foundation for specifying the concepts and relations involved in business transactions and scenarios, known as the Resource-Event-Agent (REA) ontology.
