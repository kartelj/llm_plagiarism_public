Content contributed by users on web forums tends to increase more frequently than it is altered or removed, thus its approach in incremental crawling differs from standard website page crawling. The addition of new content can result in shifting existing content to new or already existing pages. Incremental forum crawling is a complex task, as disregarding the manner in which the content is displayed, distributed, and organized could result in the relocation of posts that have already been indexed in previous crawl cycles. Furthermore, there are numerous forum technologies that offer varying navigational routes to the latest posts and different methods of displaying and organizing user-generated content.

This dissertation introduces the Structure-driven Incremental Forum crawler (SInFo), a tool designed to target the most recent content in incremental forum crawling using sophisticated optimization techniques and machine learning. The primary objective of the proposed system is to bypass content that has already been indexed in new crawl cycles, irrespective of the technology used. To accomplish this, the following web forum characteristics were utilized: (1) the sorting method on the index and thread pages, and (2) the available navigation routes between the pages provided by the current web forum technology. As the date of content creation is crucial in determining the type of sort, identifying and normalizing it is not a simple task. Machine learning models were employed for this task, as the generated dates can vary in format and language. Meanwhile, navigational path detection is accomplished by decoding the URL format and scanning the targeted pages.

It has been proven that using the suggested methods and techniques to target pages with the most recent content can minimize the number of duplicate content downloads and maximize the use of the navigational structure and routes of the current forum technology. The experiments were conducted on a broad range of existing popular forum technologies as well as on individual standalone forum technologies. SInFo has proven to be highly precise and minimizes the number of duplicate content transfers in each new crawl cycle. Most of the duplicates encountered by the proposed system are from pages that needed to be visited to accurately determine the navigational path or find the appropriate URL. Additionally, despite their complexity, machine learning models performed well during crawling and demonstrated high accuracy in date detection and normalization, achieving an F1-measure of 99%.
