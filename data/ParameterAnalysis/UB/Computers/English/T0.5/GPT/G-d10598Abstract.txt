A literature review revealed various perspectives on the concept of performance. Most approaches agree that performance is the execution of behaviors or actions that contribute to achieving organizational goals and can be quantified. Performance indicators are crucial management tools that guide management towards beneficial long-term strategies and effective short-term decision-making. Financial indicators, based on current and past performance, are used to predict future business operations and are integral to performance indicators in other business functions. Performance management is a comprehensive management system that incorporates other systems and forms the foundation for sound managerial decision-making. This thesis aims to examine the potential link between an organization's financial and business performance. The organization's success is defined by a widely accepted approach. The fundamental hypothesis that business success correlates with financial performance indicators has been confirmed through a review of secondary sources and empirical research conducted on the most successful companies over a five-year period. The results reveal that most successful companies' financial performance indicators tend to cluster at specific intervals. The data's statistical analysis demonstrated a distinct correlation between certain financial performance indicators and the company's age and industry. Consequently, empirical research found a statistically significant difference between the values of certain financial performance indicators in more and less successful organizations. Based on the research data analysis, a new theoretically established management concept based on financial performance indicators has been defined.
