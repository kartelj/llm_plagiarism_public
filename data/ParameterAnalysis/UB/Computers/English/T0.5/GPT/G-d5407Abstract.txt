This study outlines a methodological strategy for constructing a telecommunication company's information system utilizing models. This is achieved by merging general IS development methods with a specific initiative in the telecommunications field. The approach employs MDA (Model Driven Architecture), a software development strategy standardized and endorsed by OMG (Object Management Group), and EA (Enterprise Architecture), a method for concurrent development of a company's Business and IT Architecture. The most prevalent and well-known architecture framework for EA development is TOGAF (The Open Group Architectural Framework). 

The study also utilizes NGOSS (New Generation Operations Systems and Software), a program under development by the Telemanagement Forum that provides a framework for developing and implementing "Operation and Business Support Systems â€“ OSS/BSS" within the telecommunications industry. Additionally, SPL (Software Product Line), a development of IS over Software Product Lines, represents a modern approach to domain-specific model-driven software development, where a software product family, rather than a single software product, is developed through domain engineering. 

The methodological approach is based on a software product line specific to the telecommunications domain, which is based on NGOSS frameworks and models and allows for the efficient construction of a Telecommunication Company IS through three distinct processes: General domain engineering for the telecommunications domain, domain engineering for a type of telecommunications service, and application engineering. 

To define a methodological framework for the development of a model-driven telecom operator IS, it is crucial to understand the various dimensions of complexity in telecommunications domains: Functional Domains, Areas of Integrated Processes, Types of Telecommunication Services, IS Development Life-Cycles Phases, and Specific Telecom Operators IS being developed for. It is then necessary to define both mutual relationships and dimension-shifting sequences. 

The study concludes with a comparison of the advantages and disadvantages of the existing approaches and methods used in the thesis and discusses the benefits brought by the approach proposed in the thesis. The automation of the presented methodological approach results in more efficient IS development, particularly considering the potential of this approach to become the general methodology of IS development.
