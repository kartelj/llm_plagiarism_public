This doctoral thesis primarily focuses on a classification model, aiming to develop a model using case-based reasoning (CBR) and intelligent selection of similarity measures for more accurate classification of new cases. The study explores the potential of domain knowledge, expressed through preference functions, in enhancing the predictive performance of a CBR system. The thesis also examines whether a model that employs specific similarity measures for categorical data and preference functions for numerical data could outperform the conventional k-NN CBR model. 

In all CBR models, similarity measure between cases is crucial. Conventionally, Euclidean metric and overlap function are used for measuring similarity between numerical variables and categorical attributes respectively. However, the thesis proposes the use of preference theory functions for similarity measure, as they offer more flexibility in expressing decision-makers' preferences. 

The thesis presents the results of classification models that use specific similarity measures for categorical attributes along with preference functions for numerical attributes. It also includes the optimization of attribute weights and the effects of varying the number of nearest neighbors considered on the models' predictive power. 

A genetic algorithm is employed to set the parameters of each preference function and the attribute weights. The model is tested on three different benchmark datasets of clients applying for credit. The accuracy of the models is evaluated using a 10-fold cross-validation test, with cross-validation folds generated using a seed for data randomization. 

The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed models with preference theory functions consistently outperform the traditional k-NN classifier, irrespective of the similarity measures used for categorical attributes. Conversely, models using preference theory functions and different similarity measures for categorical data indicate that each dataset has a best-suited technique that uses an appropriate similarity measure for categorical attributes alongside preference theory functions.
