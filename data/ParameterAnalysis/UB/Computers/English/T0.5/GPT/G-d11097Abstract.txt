Market positioning is a concept that involves actively shaping tourist offerings or services, which allows tourism companies to secure an optimal position in the market. The initial approach to positioning, developed in the 1970s, focused on a single company's promotional activities. The main challenge for marketers was to establish a unique place in the consumer's mind through marketing efforts. Since then, many authors have explored and defined the positioning concept from various angles, but no universal market coordinates have been established to ensure an optimal, stable, and sustainable market position. As the positioning concept has evolved, the methods used to achieve positioning goals have varied, including multidimensional scaling and discriminant, factor, and conjoint analysis. 

This dissertation suggests a new approach to market positioning problems, which combines statistical models and operational research models. This approach allows marketing managers to respond quickly and formulate market positioning strategies in a competitive environment. The proposed model allows for predicting potential competitive moves, balancing focus on consumer preferences and competition, and better formulating an optimal market strategy. Conjoint analysis is used to assess consumer preferences, offering insight into market heterogeneity and the opportunity to determine the optimal features of a tourist product. In cases of heterogeneous preferences, market segmentation can be achieved using cluster analysis. 

Given the intensely competitive nature of modern markets, all potential market interactions must be considered. This seemingly chaotic market conflict conceals rationalities, which can be modeled using game theory concepts. The combined application of these three models (conjoint analysis, cluster analysis, and game theory) allows for a more effective determination of the optimal market position than previous methods, which typically used these models separately. The application and validity of this unique market positioning model is demonstrated through a real-world example of gastronomy events.

The proposed model's adaptability, flexibility, and capacity for dynamic decision-making make it particularly valuable. It can be reapplied as market conditions change, such as the launch of a new product, improvements to an existing product, or shifts in consumer preferences, to maintain an optimal market position. In the future, this model could be widely implemented across all sectors of tourism and other service sectors, serving as a general paradigm for determining the optimal market position.
