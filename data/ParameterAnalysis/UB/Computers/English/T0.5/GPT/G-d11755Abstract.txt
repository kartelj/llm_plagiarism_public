Despite significant advancements in artificial intelligence, the human brain remains superior in understanding and manipulating partially known facts. This is particularly evident in the area of question answering. When providing answers, especially those not explicitly found in a text corpus, human experts excel in explaining, combining complex responses, and abstract reasoning. Intelligent Question Routing Systems (IQRS) act as a conduit for knowledge exchange in any field requiring intensive user communication. Benefits of these systems include reducing unnecessary expert engagement and enhancing the quality of service by ensuring questions are answered by the appropriate individuals. 

This dissertation presents a methodology for designing IQRS systems. It begins with a review of existing research, focusing on the implementation of IQRS process phases. This review introduces a novel presentation paradigm that encapsulates the essence of approaches found in existing literature. This paradigm includes three core processing stages related to system implementation: question analysis, question forwarding, and user knowledge profiling. 

The dissertation then describes an IQRS prototype that embodies the proposed ideas. The question analysis module implements an approach that allows for question visualization, providing an intuitive representation of the relations between concepts and their importance in the question. 

The dissertation also discusses current methods for determining the semantic similarity of two short texts, focusing on those suitable for languages with limited electronic linguistic resources. Based on these discussions, a new algorithm, LInSTSS, is proposed. This algorithm calculates the semantic similarity of two short texts considering the specificity of the words they contain. 

The dissertation proposes a new algorithm called P2Q for the question forwarding phase. This algorithm identifies the highest similarity between the concepts in a question and those in a user profile. The dissertation concludes with an analysis of web portals to identify one suitable for creating a questions and answers corpus. The corpus is then used to test the initial hypothesis and evaluate the system's overall performance. 

The dissertation's scientific contribution lies in the analysis and synthesis of a software system designed to intelligently route questions. It concludes that properly assigned weights can improve the system's overall performance, but incorrect weights can significantly decrease performance. It also emphasizes the importance of considering both the user's knowledge and interests when profiling their competence to answer a given question.
