Determining the effort needed to execute a software system is a challenging yet crucial task in software engineering. The effort estimate often determines if a project will commence, its constraints, and its likelihood of successful completion and utilization. Unfortunately, these estimates are frequently made using incomplete requirements, various heuristics, assumptions, and experience, where the best possible estimates are needed within a restricted timeframe. Despite significant advancements in several software engineering areas, effort estimation methods primarily rely on the subjective evaluation by project teams or subject matter experts, often resulting in higher than anticipated effort estimate errors. Global statistics reveal that only a third of software projects succeed, another third exceed budget and time limits, while the rest fail, primarily due to inaccurate effort estimates. This thesis aims to evaluate current effort estimation methods and suggest new ones to enhance effort estimation. The central concept to be discussed in the thesis is the application of novel models and techniques to improve existing effort estimation methods. The thesis will present suggestions to enhance current evaluation methods and the tangible results achievable using these solutions in real software projects. Improvements are limited to identifying project parameters that most impact the effort and establishing the relationships between these parameters and the effort.
