The proliferation of internet-capable digital multimedia devices in modern households, including mobile devices like smartphones and tablets, as well as digital TVs and set-top boxes, has seen a significant upsurge in recent years. The ready availability and customizable nature of these devices have greatly streamlined the development of distributed applications. Applications developed within an integrated environment can present users with innovative human-computer interaction (HCI) scenarios that single-device scenarios cannot offer.

A study of existing HCI systems that merge digital TV and mobile devices in a living room setting revealed that current systems have ad-hoc implementations with limited flexibility and are unable to explore various HCI scenario combinations. This dissertation introduces the SHARP development framework, designed to facilitate efficient implementation of distributed systems in an integrated environment encompassing digital TV, mobile devices, and the internet. The framework aims to aid HCI researchers in developing innovative applications that provide different HCI scenario combinations in the living room with less effort.

The dissertation begins with survey results that provide an overview of existing HCI systems designed for a living room setting. Common attributes of these systems are identified, and a list of potential HCI scenarios that applications developed for an integrated environment can offer is compiled. These scenarios include content sharing on multiple screens, mobile device control of central screen actions, motion detection via sensors, supplementary sensory feedback, passive TV viewing combined with parallel interaction, enhanced user experience via access to various information services, and interaction between both co-located and non-co-located individuals.

After identifying these scenarios, a proposal for the SHARP development framework is detailed, including its design and implementation. The framework's design enables developers to create applications that incorporate the identified scenarios. The field of game development was chosen to test the framework's benefits, as game applications have proven to be both popular and profitable. Five different games were developed using the SHARP framework to demonstrate its flexibility and showcase innovative applications that offer new scenario combinations to users. The acceptance of the identified scenarios by users was assessed by examining the experiences of 59 test users interacting with the developed game applications.

The SHARP framework's efficacy was validated by comparing the size, complexity, and responsiveness of applications developed with and without the framework. The results indicate that the framework significantly reduced both development and testing effort by shifting complex game implementation logic to reusable framework components. Responsiveness measurements from applications developed with and without the framework revealed that, despite the framework introducing a slight overhead resulting in marginally longer response times, all versions remained well within acceptable performance parameters.
