The use of biometric technologies is becoming increasingly common in our modern society, to the point where it could be said they are now a part of daily life. Each biometric authentication system is unique, with specific needs and limitations depending on its usage context. Selecting the right biometric modality and corresponding algorithm requires a thorough evaluation of the system's performance, which can be a complex task. This is true for both unimodal and multimodal biometric systems. Even when open biometric databases are available for evaluation, the system must be adapted to the testing protocol of the chosen database. The evaluation process becomes even more complex when the biometric system uses multiple modalities due to the variety of fusion algorithms available. To address these challenges, this thesis proposes a unified model for evaluating multimodal biometric systems, as current literature lacks a detailed model. This model is based on the Model Driven Architecture (MDA) paradigm and includes a metamodel representing the ontology of terms used in this field. Utilizing this model, a prototype framework has been developed to evaluate multimodal biometric systems in various use cases. Experimental results demonstrate that this framework reduces the time required for evaluation by 75%. Additionally, a new analytical method for optimizing the biometric system threshold, based on predefined system behavior, has been developed. Lastly, a learning tool utilizing some of the framework's functionalities demonstrates how it can enhance the efficiency of training engineers in the field of biometrics.
