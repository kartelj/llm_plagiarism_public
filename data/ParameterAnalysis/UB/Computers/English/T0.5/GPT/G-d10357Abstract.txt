The importance of continuous education and training as a fundamental principle for the development of modern society, which is heavily reliant on technological advancements and global business, cannot be overstated. The pace of education and learning has significantly increased due to the evolution of IT and technological progress, giving rise to new scientific knowledge and fields. 

In the early 21st century, a new scientific field emerged known as business intelligence. This discipline focuses on discovering data relationships in education through Educational Data Mining. This involves developing methods to analyze and determine the validity of data from the education sector to better understand student behavior and enhance teaching progress. 

The focus of this PhD thesis is the application of business intelligence in education to identify key factors for student success and improve the higher education process. The thesis explores the most critical variables for a student's success, from their background and high school performance to their first-year undergraduate success and its correlation with their overall academic achievement. The thesis also proposes a software solution for analyzing, monitoring, and forecasting undergraduate student success as part of an integrated knowledge and information exchange portal for students and faculty.

The dissertation is organized into 12 chapters, starting with an introduction that outlines the objectives, hypotheses, and research plan. The next two chapters delve into the fundamental concepts of business intelligence and data mining, including a comprehensive review of related literature. The fourth chapter outlines the proposed research model, particularly the software support used for implementation and the data structures employed. The fifth chapter applies descriptive and comparative analysis for a detailed definition of data structures and their interdependencies and correlations.

Chapters six to eight introduce the development of a predictive model using regression, decision trees, support vector machines, and artificial neural networks in RapidMiner, Clementine, and Matlab software environments. The ninth chapter provides a comparative analysis of the predictive model's performance and identifies the attributes influencing study success. 

The tenth chapter presents the basic structure and functionality of the information system for analyzing and monitoring higher education performance. The eleventh chapter offers concluding remarks, summarizes key results, and provides guidelines for future development and improvement of predictive models. The final chapter provides a bibliography.

The thesis includes two appendices. The first provides a detailed specification of cases where the developed information system is used. The second presents a detailed analysis of influential factors on performance and success.

The research project presents a comprehensive application of business intelligence methods and techniques to analyze and predict undergraduate student success. The developed models can aid professors in identifying students who need additional training or those who are highly ambitious. The models can also provide students with insights into their potential success based on their learning and work habits and can be beneficial for companies seeking future apprentices or employees. 

The thesis concludes with the recommendation of 14 models that predict academic success with over 90% accuracy. The research results will contribute to the further development of systems and models for predicting student success in higher education institutions. The results can also be applied to other higher education systems with minimal modifications, ultimately improving the entire academic education process. 

An integrated system for monitoring undergraduate student success has been developed, which can assist higher education institutions in making informed decisions and directing curriculum development optimally. The research conducted in this thesis will help bring educational data mining closer to researchers in Serbia and initiate the process of introducing systems and models for predicting student success in higher education institutions.
