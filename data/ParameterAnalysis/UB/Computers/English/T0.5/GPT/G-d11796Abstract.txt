Wireless sensor networks comprise multiple small computing devices, known as sensor nodes. These nodes are equipped with one or more sensors to collect environmental data and can establish radio communications with other nodes within the network. Due to their ability to generate vast amounts of data, wireless sensor networks are ideal for implementing machine learning techniques. The work discussed here aims to adapt specific data mining algorithms for distributed execution, enabling them to operate directly on the sensor nodes.

Analyzing the problem resulted in three fundamental requirements for a distributed data mining algorithm suitable for execution in a wireless sensor network. First, it's crucial to minimize node communication as it uses considerable energy. Second, the algorithm must produce accurate results. Third, reliance on centralized computational resources should be minimized.

The significant contribution of this thesis is the development of two unique algorithms for distributed machine learning, tailored to meet the needs of execution in a wireless sensor network. The first algorithm is a two-layer classification scheme. The first layer operates on the sensor nodes and can use any classifier (tested using J48 decision trees). The outcomes of this step are then forwarded to a centralized, second-layer classifier based on a weighted voting scheme. The second algorithm is a clustering algorithm based on Kohonen neural networks. The network's architecture is adjusted to the nature of the data obtained from sensor nodes in wireless sensor networks. This data consists of two variability sources: the location information of a sensed event and the event's properties. Accordingly, the proposed Kohonen neural network is designed with two layers, the first clusters data according to the event's location, and the second clusters data based on the event type.

Calculations indicate that both proposed algorithms significantly reduce energy consumption. The algorithms' accuracy was confirmed through computational simulations. In conclusion, the proposed algorithms are suitable for various practical applications, and the machine learning techniques provide a feasible solution for constructing sustainable large wireless sensor networks.
