Gamma Scintillation Cameras (GSC) are devices used in the medical field to analyze the distribution of radiopharmaceuticals that have been injected, inhaled, or ingested. The progress of integrated circuit technology has impacted the design of the GSC's head and the flexibility, speed, cost and scalability of the systems that support image acquisition, storage, and analysis. Despite the advent of digital GSCs in the 1980s, many nuclear medical centers still operate with analogue or semi-analogue GSCs, which are fully functional and fundamental to nuclear imaging. The ideal approach is to digitize the GSC and integrate it with contemporary computer systems.

Digitizing analogue and semi-analogue GSCs offers several benefits: it extends the lifespan of older GSCs and delays the need for new equipment; it allows for the most effective analysis of nuclear-medical studies following the principles of Evidence-Based Medicine (EBM); and it facilitates the testing and development of new analysis techniques to enhance patient treatment, provided the system architecture is open.

The research discussed in this doctoral thesis aims to develop a computer system, known as the GammaKey system, that provides semi-analogue GSCs with functionality (acquisition, storage, and image processing) that is compatible with modern digital systems and has an open architecture. This open architecture allows for the development and clinical application of new diagnostic techniques.

The GammaKey system is designed to meet several requirements: it can easily replace the original computer system with minimal training necessary due to its intuitive Windows graphical interface; it is reliable, meeting the quality standards set by the National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA), and ensures no loss of patient or study information and accurate results; it is compatible with other medical and non-medical systems using standard data formats and allows for data synchronization between two workstations; it allows for a quick, simple, and affordable upgrade to newer generations of computers and analog-to-digital converters (ADC) using the LabVIEW software environment and commercial National Instruments ADC; and it supports the development and implementation of new, non-standard acquisition protocols and study processing tools.

The GammaKey system has been used in daily clinical practice at two leading medical centers in Serbia and has examined more than 30,000 patients. It allows for continuity in basic clinical practice and research, the establishment of valid reference values, and the validation of other applications, fully supporting the EBM concept.
