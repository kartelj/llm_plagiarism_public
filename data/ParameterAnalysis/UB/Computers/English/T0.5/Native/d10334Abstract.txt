The main objective of this study is to propose and empirically examine an integrative model of retail customer loyalty in Serbia. A review of literature addressing key determinants of service customer loyalty, such as service quality, satisfaction and perceived value, preceded primary research. The study was performed by means of a structured questionnaire, on a convenience sample of 737 customers of retail trade in non-specialised, food predominating stores, using techniques of multivariate data analysis, performed by means of software packages SPSS 18 and LISREL 8.80. Results of exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis indicate multidimensional nature of service quality construct in the context of Serbian retailing. Four dimensions of retail service quality were discovered which can be identified as follows: (F1) Behavior and appearance of employees, (F2) Atmospherics, (F3) Communication with customers and (F4) Spatial layout and assortment. Structural equation modelling indicated customer satisfaction as the most significant determinant of customer loyalty, followed by perceived value, which total effect consisted of both direct and indirect impact on loyalty, mediated via satisfaction. This studyâ€˜s findings also indicate significant impact of service quality on customer loyalty. Althoug this latent variable did not exert statistically significant direct impact on customer loyalty, it however indirectly affected customer loyalty, by the mediating variables of satisfaction and perceived value. Results of the study indicate the necessity of measurement and improvement of customer satisfaction and perceived value, as well as service quality, with the aim of creating loyal customer base. Since the study was performed on a convenience sample of retail customers, in future studies attention should be paid to the development of service quality scale and measurement of customer satisfaction and perceived value on a representative sample of Serbian retail customers.
