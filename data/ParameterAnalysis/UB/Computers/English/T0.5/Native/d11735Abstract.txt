Digital image compression and coding deal with minimization of the memory resources needed for presentation, storage and transmission of digital image. Use of compression techniques leads to substantial savings. Fast algorithms and architectures for compression and decompression are of a primary importance in the applications where real time performance is required. Existing techniques for digital image compression with high compression ratio are slow and require complex processors and large amounts of high bandwidth memory, at the same time increasing power consumption. Both processing time and memory capacity increase as the compression ratio increases. In this doctoral dissertation, we approached the problem of hardware realization of a codec which minimizes the required memory resources, is fast and has a high compression ratio. The task has been accomplished by means of combined scientific methods. The minimization of the required memory resources is achieved by means of optimized nonstationary filters and a new algorithm of two-dimensional subband transformation, as well as a one pass realization of probability estimators. The speed of operation is achieved by means of one pass algorithm for probabilities estimation and the fact that the input image is not processed partially. The high compression ratio is achieved by joint effects of all the subsystems in the realization: subband transformer, quantizer, one pass probabilities estimator and entropy encoder. The hardware realization from this dissertation has been verified by means of image compression system with network interface. It is shown that it is possible to implement entire color image encoder within a low cost programmable logic device, with no external memory components.
