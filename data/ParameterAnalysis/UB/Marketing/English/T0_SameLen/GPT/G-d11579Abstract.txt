Fundamentally, this PhD thesis, apart from the introduction and overall conclusions with suggestions for future studies, consists of three distinct yet deeply interconnected and intertwined sections, each offering its own conclusion. The initial section (chapters 2 to 5) encompasses definitions of quality indicators, human capital and social capital, as well as an examination of their relationships. The conceptualization of human capital is used to articulate the worth of our human abilities. Despite numerous attempts to standardize the definition and categorize human capital, it appears that none have succeeded in forming a global agreement on a human capital model that could be utilized for all necessary measurements and computations. This issue impacts all major fields, including science. Moreover, it has become clear that any current analysis of human capital is virtually pointless without the application of the concept of social capital, as avoiding their overlap is unfeasible. While human capital includes an individual's knowledge, skills, competencies, experience, intellect, talents, know-how, expertise, etc., social capital is even more elusive, as it is inherent in the structure of relationships among individuals. It could be perceived as the only type of capital that increases only when shared, originating from family connections, friendships, professional and other bonds. Lastly, quality indicators are the qualitative and/or quantitative data on a studied phenomenon, enabling its evolution to be analyzed and to verify whether quality objectives are achieved, set directions, and make suitable decisions and actions. In addition to indicating process performances, they can also be helpful in identifying areas that need more in-depth studies and investigations: They monitor changes over time, thereby highlighting potential quality issues, being associated with a specific stakeholder or an interested party. Therefore, to connect quality indicators with critical success factors, they should always be centered around the needs and expectations of the main stakeholders and interested parties. The second section aims to present and elucidate concepts with increasing potential to influence approaches to human and social capital management in the future. It questions traditional views on management issues by allowing theories from other fields (virtual, technical, history, nature) to transition to the realm of social complexity and offer a new paradigm, based on the complexity theory which provides vivid metaphors for understanding both the world's nature and human sense making: the worldview. This approach transcends mere linearity and is socially responsible: in the long term, it contributes to sustainable development, while at the organizational level this model could serve as a strategic alignment umbrella for employee behavior. In this context, throughout this section, innovative solutions are provided for various governance and management systems (environmental, HR, marketing, social responsibility, etc.) beyond their direct actions to conclude how policy makers can utilize this paradigm shift to achieve stronger stakeholder engagement, particularly in science, education, and overall knowledge production. This process facilitated the emergence of quality indicators for the human and social capital of the scientific community. The third section begins with a description of how the quality indicators model for this research was developed. To ensure the success of this process, it was necessary to uncover entirely new data sources, as using new indicators with outdated data formats will not result in a new breakthrough: The new data should inform policy makers about changes in understandings, behaviors, beliefs, and attitudes. This also necessitated a shift from aggregated, macro statistics to smaller details, tailored to the circumstances of the scientific community. The research methodology (model implementation) involved data collection in two directions: The questionnaire was sent to Serbian-origin scientists both in the Homeland and Diaspora, followed by an analysis of their CVs, and a broader search of their data in all publicly accessible sources (from Google to social network profiles). The research sample included 444 PhDs (202 in the Homeland and 242 in the Diaspora) and it allowed all three basic hypotheses to be confirmed. Among the most significant findings are the facts that Serbian PhDs in the Diaspora, compared to those in the Homeland, publish over 4 times more papers, around 6 times more papers in journals with IF, are cited above 15 times more, in 14 times more documents, have 13 times higher value of overall IF, over 5 times higher ResearchGate score and around 5.5 times higher value of the h-index. In doing so, they are more likely to use a strategy of more co-authors - on average, they have 4 times more coauthors than PhDs in the Homeland. Also, the study has shown that the Serbian scientific Diaspora have an advantage in the ways they perceive work in science and research, the position and role of management for it, lifelong learning in the context of international mobility, and languages they speak. Along with that, Serbian PhDs worldwide also more strongly believe that people's consciousness evolves faster than ever before, due to the impact of science and technology. On the other hand, members of the scientific community in the Homeland, according to this sample, are characterized by a higher devotion to the interests of the broader community they identify with, including greater respect for traditions and heritage. PhDs in Serbia, compared to those in its Diaspora, consider "succession planning" as a more important factor in their work, are more willing to take into account the experiences of their ancestors when making crucial decisions, and generally feel more fearful of the possibility that current trends of our civilization - especially regarding the level of consumption, and despite all capacities of science we have developed, may lead the entire humanity towards some form of collapse.
