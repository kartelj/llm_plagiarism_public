Information technologies (IT) are the catalysts for contemporary societal and business growth. In the current business landscape, IT instigates alterations in business systems and organizational operations. The increasing use of expertise, methodologies, and techniques in project management has aided in enhancing management systems in organizations, with the goal of establishing competitive market advantages. IT project management within organizations encompasses the process of aligning IT and business strategies, aiming to meet the demands of internal and external stakeholders. The degree of IT application and sophistication is contingent on the organizational capacity and the strategies employed in the business strategy execution process. A successful IT strategy formulation necessitates a framework for efficient and effective technology deployment. Hence, the utilization of competency and capacity assessment systems allows organizations to set up a quality foundation for value generation through IT. Maturity models are contemporary tools for evaluating organizational competency and capacity in project management. Both previous research findings and studies conducted by the academic and professional community suggest two paths in organizational maturity analysis. The use of universal maturity assessment models on diverse project types has led to the neglect of competencies unique to a specific industry. Furthermore, maturity models used in the IT industry do not incorporate the analysis of project and organizational competencies and capacities. The objective of this thesis is to develop a comprehensive model for organizational maturity assessment that will encompass both evaluation systems. To create a comprehensive model for IT project management maturity assessment, primary data has been utilized, obtained through quantitative and qualitative empirical research. The research included organizations whose business strategy includes a well-defined IT component. The research process involved a 360-degree analysis and evaluation of the organization from the viewpoints of IT specialists, project managers, directors, investors, and end users. This is the inaugural instance of this type of research being conducted in the Republic of Serbia, while internationally there are only partial results for some general and specific aspects of the evaluation. The research findings validate the primary hypothesis, i.e., that it is feasible to develop a model based on competencies, processes, documentation, management systems, and metrics for IT project management. These components influence the value delivered, knowledge management, project performance, and project management organizational system. Based on the suggested model, we have established reference measures for six maturity levels. These measures allow us to compare Serbian organizations based on their best-practice IT project management. Additionally, the suggested model can be implemented in a modular manner, depending on the organizational requirements and market demand. The comprehensive model for IT project management maturity assessment proposed in this thesis can be advantageous to both the academic and professional community. This is because the suggested model can aid in enhancing and broadening theoretical approaches and frameworks for maturity assessment, evaluating organizational competencies and capacities in IT project management, and defining the strategic direction of organizational development.
