Over the past two decades, numerous studies have revealed that despite the implementation of quality models, health care organizations continue to experience nonconformities and errors. This results in a persistent low quality of these organizations and the services they provide. The quality models implemented vary, even though they are based on the same standard, regulation, or concept, leading to differing results. The variation in the structure of these models and their outcomes can be attributed to the process of translating guidelines into the implemented model for quality assurance or improvement in health care organizations. This often overlooks non-clinical processes that are nonetheless crucial for the quality of health care organizations and their services. Information on the quality of various physicians or health care organizations, as well as the outcomes of different treatment or diagnostic methods necessary for patients to choose a particular health care organization, physician, or treatment method, is often unavailable, insufficient, or not in a suitable form for making informed decisions. There is limited information available to patients on the quality or outcome of different treatments or providers. Health care quality reports are primarily designed to support payers' choice of health plans and quality improvement among plans and providers, not patient awareness and choice. Consequently, high-quality health care organizations are not rewarded with more patient patronage for their services, and patients are not provided with understandable information that would allow them to make choices based on factors important to them. This highlights two main problem groups in achieving quality in health care organizations and reaping the benefits of quality achievement. The first problem group arises from the transformation of general standards, guidelines, and regulations into a specific model for a particular health care organization, which often overlooks non-health care processes. The second problem group arises from reporting achieved quality, where excessive data on parameters prevents patients from making simple decisions about their choice of health care organization, and the variety of data types complicates comparisons between health care organizations. Viewing health care organization as a business system through the lens of the Anatomical Structure Model developed at the Faculty of Organizational Science allows for the identification of all elements that directly or indirectly affect the quality of health care services and the structuring of the health care organization. The outcome of this process is a Model for Quality Improvement of Health Care Business Systems, which serves as a bridge between certain policies, standards, guidelines, or concepts, and a concrete model for quality assurance, control, and management of health care organizations. This model includes a graphical, verbal, and mathematical component, enabling the calculation of the quality of each constituent element of the health care business system and thus allowing for quality comparisons between health care business systems using this model, or their component elements of the same species. The model was applied in two primary health care business systems, and the results showed that the model influenced the quality improvement of the health care business system.
