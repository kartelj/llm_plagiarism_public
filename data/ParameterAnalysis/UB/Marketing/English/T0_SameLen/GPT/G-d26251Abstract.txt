This doctoral thesis research focuses on creating a smart library model utilizing big data technologies and services. The primary research issue addressed in the dissertation is the creation of big data infrastructure and intelligent library services that facilitate smart searches and suggestions from the library's content. The paper specifically explores the potential of integrating the developed model into a smart educational setting to enhance the educational process's quality. The dissertation introduces a smart library model as a crucial component of the educational system, aiming to enhance the quality and comprehensiveness of learning resources and boost user motivation through content-aware recommendations. The model outlined in the dissertation explores the potential of using a big data system for gathering, analyzing, processing, and visualizing data from various sources, and integrating this data into the smart library. The objective of creating a smart library is to enhance the library's business process and provide users with innovative search and content usage methods. The dissertation considers the prospect of implementing a big data solution for smart libraries as part of an ongoing learning process, aiming to improve library operations results by integrating traditional systems with big data technology. Besides the aforementioned system components, the model incorporates the infrastructure and integration of a recommendation system for collaborative filtering by integrating multiple differential data sources with big data technologies. The model's evaluation included testing and measuring relevant performance parameters that impact the proposed model's efficiency.
