As international operations globalize, managing intellectual capital becomes increasingly crucial. The prevailing belief today is that effective intellectual capital management is a key to organizational success. Intellectual capital is now a vital resource and operational base for modern organizations. In the early 1920s, the concept of intellectual capital became significant. Studying this concept significantly increases an organization's market value compared to its book value. Unlike tangible assets that depreciate with use, proper utilization of intellectual capital enhances an organization's value. Management is expected to identify and exploit opportunities and strengths, and mitigate or eliminate weaknesses in the face of drastic environmental changes. This approach fosters organizational growth and development. Intellectual capital holds operational and strategic importance for organizations. Today, organizations are increasingly interested in managing intellectual capital. Intellectual capital, a type of intangible asset, consists of human, structural, and relational capital. It encompasses not just organizational knowledge, but also staff competencies, organizational structure, business processes, intellectual property, and corporate culture. Both internal and external resources, including relationships with stakeholders, are crucial. Intellectual capital includes factors not reflected in official financial statements but are vital for creating organizational value. Proper utilization of intellectual capital enhances an organization's value. Its qualitative dimension is more important than the quantitative in creating added value. Intellectual capital is a guide to future dynamic environmental changes. This thesis aims to explore how organizations identify, evaluate, and report intellectual capital. It reviews relevant literature on intellectual capital and previous studies on its management in organizations. Empirical research within the thesis discusses the concept of intellectual capital in Serbian organizations and its importance for financial reporting. The study confirms the thesis hypothesis that providing an adequate intellectual capital position is a leading performance indicator in the modern age, aiming to ensure information completeness. The final conclusion emphasizes the need to value intellectual capital and present it in an additional financial statement for the most reliable and accurate representation of organizational value. The current set of financial statements and quantitative indicators lack the precision needed to present necessary information, so quantified non-financial elements, or descriptive forms, can contribute to a clearer understanding of the organization's value and potential.
