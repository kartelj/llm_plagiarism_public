The doctoral research aimed to determine if there is room for the creation or enhancement of existing knowledge management models that would provide a comprehensive understanding of the connections between social capital and knowledge management, based on prior theoretical findings on the main features of social capital in the context of knowledge management within an organization. A thorough review of literature revealed a substantial range of mutual relationships and influences that laid the groundwork for subsequent empirical research in the nonprofit sector, specifically civil society organizations operating in the European Union and Western Balkans. The study not only revealed the primary characteristics of these organizations' internal and external network operations and their knowledge management maturity level, but also validated all theoretical assumptions and identified certain peculiarities. A clear predominance of internal social capital dimensions and elements over external ones was found, suggesting that CSOs likely favor connections stemming from their internal operations, namely those established through individuals and the elements characterizing these connections found in relational, cognitive, and nodus dimensions. Consequently, external social capital, particularly structural forms through which it is developed and maintained, has not been adequately acknowledged and thus represents an area requiring significant improvement. These peculiarities were also observed when social capital dimensions and elements were compared with knowledge management phases, quality, and maturity. The empirical research demonstrated that social capital elements can be incorporated into existing knowledge management models, but due to limitations, primarily the lack of process-based nature of their functioning, it would be more practical to utilize project-based knowledge management models. For this purpose, a modified Gasik model was employed to clearly illustrate how social capital can be integrated into the knowledge management process. The implementation of such an integrated knowledge management model was examined in the context of its practical application, which could lead to a new working paradigm for CSOs, emphasizing knowledge as a crucial prerequisite for organizational competitiveness and sustainability.
