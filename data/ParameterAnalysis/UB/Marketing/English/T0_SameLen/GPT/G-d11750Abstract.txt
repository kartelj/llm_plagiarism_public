The aim of the doctoral dissertation is to highlight and elucidate how business intelligence systems can be enhanced through group decision-making processes. In the realm of business intelligence, the term 'intelligence' primarily refers to information or reports designed to aid business decision-making. Viewed in this light, business intelligence aids navigation in unfamiliar scenarios and aids in swift and precise problem-solving; however, it diverges from the conventional, psychological interpretation of the term, in that it does not pertain to an individual's personal ability, but to a technological solution employed by a corporation. Business intelligence should not be perceived as a product or a system. In reality, it is an architecture and an amalgamation of integrated operational applications and decision-supporting applications. Business intelligence embodies the utilization of all data potentials, hence the corporate information and knowledge aimed at making superior and suitable business decisions, and subsequently the capability to pinpoint new business opportunities. Assisting an individual decision-maker is a crucial activity for any successful corporate management. However, as business system operations and functionality progressively become more complex and thus the accountability for decisions made grows increasingly larger, it becomes necessary to consider all diverse thoughts and perspectives held by team members, specifically the ready amount of knowledge, all for the sake of group decision-making. Furthermore, it is a mathematically verified truth that the collective knowledge of all team members invariably surpasses the knowledge of any individual team member. The sole requirement here is the existing communication and resource sharing among team members. Conversely, the demand for quality enhancement in relation to group decision-making is apparent. This constitutes a continuous subject of interest for researchers with significant practical and theoretical knowledge. Consequently, the matters of knowledge acquisition, storage, and distribution will receive particular focus and consideration; knowledge will underpin all sections of the dissertation and will form the linking tissue of the document.
