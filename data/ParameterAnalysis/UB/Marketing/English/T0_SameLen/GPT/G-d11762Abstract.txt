Business intelligence is a crucial element in decision-making processes, essential for the effective operation and management of any organization. Its primary functions include data extraction, storage, and analysis. Recent studies in Business Intelligence have shown that valuable insights can be gleaned from unstructured data, enabling more precise decision-making across all management tiers. The capacity of an organization to establish a pervasive environment for all data extractors and decision nodes is vital for the success of the Smart Grid concept. Smart Grid technologies are introducing innovations in the electrical power sector, impacting all aspects of the electricity supply chain, and prompting changes in market structures and business models. Business intelligence and performance management infrastructures are widely acknowledged as necessary for comprehensive energy systems adopting Smart Grid technologies. This dissertation presents a business intelligence model for B2B e-business of the transmission system and electricity market operator, specifically designed for monitoring electricity market activity through essential information and data flows. Developing a Business intelligence solution tailored for electricity power systems necessitates a structured and well-defined methodology and an architecture that outlines the fundamental elements of a data warehouse. The primary objective of the methodology for designing a business intelligence system proposed in this dissertation was to investigate how Kimball’s approach for modeling a business intelligence system could serve as a foundation for implementing new data warehouse objects, with minimal dependence on predefined objects within the SAP environment. To accomplish this, a "bottom-up" approach was employed, along with a modified dimension life-cycle adapted for Accelerated SAP for Business Warehouse methodology. The methodology proposed in this dissertation was implemented in practice, resulting in a business intelligence system for monitoring electricity market activity. The proposed solution was evaluated in the Public Enterprise "Elektromreža Srbije". The findings indicate that business intelligence solutions can enhance market management in a data-rich environment and can be effectively used for reporting in various business sectors of the organization. Additionally, comparative analysis results provide suggestions and recommendations for combined methodologies that can be employed for the development of robust business intelligence systems.
