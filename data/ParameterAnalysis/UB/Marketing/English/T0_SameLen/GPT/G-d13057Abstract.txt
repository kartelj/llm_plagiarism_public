The objective of his doctoral thesis research is to develop the idea of integrated advertising, which is implemented by optimizing performance and producing positive outcomes for both advertisers and the intended audience. The thesis explores the impact of various advertising tools and their potential for integration to deliver a consistent message that elicits positive cognitive and emotional responses from the audience. Empirical research was conducted in December 2015 at the Faculty of Organizational Sciences, with a sample of 322 second-year students. The study was conducted in two consecutive stages. The first stage involved three experiments under controlled laboratory conditions, exposing participants to specific audio-visual materials featuring indirect, direct, and integrated advertising. The second stage involved participants completing printed questionnaires to gauge their cognitive and emotional responses. Unaided recall, aided recall, and recognition tests were used to evaluate cognitive components, while attitude evaluation tests were used to assess emotional responses to different types of advertising and advertised products. The empirical research results showed that integrated advertising had the most potential for brand positioning in the audience's minds. Direct advertising also yielded satisfactory results, although slightly less effective than integrated advertising, likely due to the audience's focus on the experimental material, which may not reflect real-world conditions. The results indicated that audiences have difficulty remembering brands advertised indirectly without specific reminders, suggesting that this advertising type is ineffective when used alone. However, participants expressed positive attitudes towards indirect advertising, making it a useful tool for overcoming audience resistance, which may result from overexposure to various marketing stimuli. These findings underscore the importance of planning advertising primarily in an integrated form, with synergistic messages. Considering the results, indirect advertising could take precedence over direct advertising in integrated advertising planning, given its potential to achieve various objectives beyond motivating purchases. Positioning in the audience's minds and creating a resonant effect could provide a stronger stimulus for long-term investments integrated with other marketing and corporate communication tools.
