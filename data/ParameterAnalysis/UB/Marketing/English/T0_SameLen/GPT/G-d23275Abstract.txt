The doctoral thesis focuses on creating a national-level environmental management model by incorporating risk assessment methods. This model would aid in national decision-making processes for law, policy, and strategy creation, and enhance national environmental risk management. It also promotes a comprehensive approach to environmental risk assessment, considering often overlooked risk factors such as public perception of environmental risks and the varying environmental risk propensity of society's different participants, from individuals and organizations to other social groups. The national environmental management model that integrates risk assessment methods discussed in this thesis employs a hybrid approach. It uses both qualitative and quantitative risk assessment methods to rank varying environmental and ecological risks, thereby assisting in prioritizing environmental management goals. The model's implementation aims to pinpoint critical national environmental management areas and provide guidance for setting strategic priorities for environmental problem-solving and protection. One advantage of this model is seen in the results of its national implementation, which improves a country's environmental quality and human health. It does this by prioritizing environmental management goals based on ranked 7 environmental and ecological risks and by involving the public in risk perception, assessment, and environmental decision-making processes. This involvement strengthens support for the development of a transparent and effective national policy and strategies for a country's environmental protection.
