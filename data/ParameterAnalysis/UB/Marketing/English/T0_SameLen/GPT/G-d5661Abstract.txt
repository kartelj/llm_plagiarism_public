This doctoral thesis aims to elucidate the significance of special events nationally and globally. Historically, people have congregated for diverse occasions. These events were deemed unique and extraordinary experiences. They occurred infrequently, often due to specific circumstances, individual requests, or governmental group demands. Consequently, they incited excitement and a distinct impact. The leisure and entertainment sector is currently a primary focus. Over recent years, it has experienced rapid growth and now holds a unique position in the service market, generating numerous innovative service delivery ideas. Event management agencies are globally renowned and hold a substantial stake in business success, profit, and positive customer feedback in the service industry worldwide. Conversely, decision making is a task every manager must undertake during their working hours. Decisions are constantly made, not only in relation to traditional management functions but also in the organization of special events. Decision making is not an isolated management function, but a common thread through all other functions. Managers at all organizational levels participate in various decisions, from operational and tactical to strategic. This thesis will demonstrate how utilizing a group decision-making system can enhance the organization of special events.
