The objective of this doctoral thesis is to create hybrid models that enhance the multi-criteria decision-making process. Current tools supporting this process have demonstrated their reliability and efficiency. However, analysis has shown that they fall short in adequately considering the mutual comparison, conditionality, and logical dependencies among decision-making attributes. As a result, the thesis proposes multi-criteria models that address these decision problems by integrating classical and fuzzy multi-criteria analysis methods, as well as the application of interpolate Boolean algebra. The central hypothesis of the thesis is that a combination of interpolate Boolean approach, fuzzy logic, and multi-criteria analysis method can model the decision-making process more effectively than a single multi-criteria analysis method. Classical multi-criteria analysis methods are commonly used to address decision-making problems, but they lack a suitable framework for presenting uncertain/imprecise attributes. These conditions are conducive to the development of fuzzy set theory, which allows for the analysis of uncertain attributes using fuzzy numbers. Therefore, this doctoral thesis has developed hybrid models that merge classical and fuzzy multi-criteria analysis methods to address these shortcomings and yield more reliable results. Additionally, models based on interpolate Boolean algebra that incorporate logical attribute interactions are proposed. This approach expands the capabilities of decision-makers' linguistic statements and provides a more realistic problem perspective. The proposed models are tested using examples of ranking business banks and telecommunications equipment suppliers. An integrated model combining classical and fuzzy multi-criteria analysis methods is proposed to address the business bank selection problem. Conversely, an integrated model that combines a two-stage multi-criteria analysis method and a hybrid model that includes an analysis of the logical interaction between the attributes using Boolean algebra in accordance with all Boolean laws is proposed to address the supplier ranking problem. The research results indicate that combining multi-criteria analysis methods can overcome the limitations of classical methods and outperform individual multi-criteria methods. Additionally, the application of interpolate Boolean algebra facilitates the modeling of attribute interactions and interdependencies, making it significantly easier for decision-makers to accurately represent the actual decision-making problem. The primary contribution of the doctoral thesis is to enhance the decision-making system by developing combined multi-criteria models in situations where decision-making attributes cannot be precisely determined if they involve certain conditionalities and logical interactions. The main motivation for this paper is its practical application in real business systems.
