The paper's aim is to enhance understanding of quality costing in current practice and ascertain the necessity for a quality cost model within a process-systemic approach context. The study, presented in the paper, was carried out on 186 companies across various sectors. Only companies knowledgeable about quality costs were chosen for the study. The research's company database was established using three indicators of the companies' understanding of quality costs. The findings indicate a high awareness of the significance of quality costs and a rise in the number of companies managing these costs. Influential factors on quality costs management systems were highlighted, and relationships among variables defining these systems were examined. Furthermore, the ISO 9001:2015 standard requirements, which have a statistically significant correlation with the variables defining quality costs management, were chosen based on the companies' views on the importance of their compliance. Given the research findings highlight the need for a quality cost model within a process-systemic approach context, the PAF model is utilized in this paper at the process level, to suggest a quality cost model where quality cost elements are considered in relation to process outputs, and where the principle that one process impacts another process's quality through its outputs is acknowledged. In the model, quality costs are calculated for each process at two points: current (before measures are taken) and expected (after measures are taken). Necessary control or improvement measures are implemented based on the analysis of nonconformity causes and in line with the PAF model assumption that preventive and appraisal activities decrease failure costs and total quality costs. In the model, the difference between total quality costs at two observed points is viewed as the maximum possible quality cost reduction for the observed process. This value is used as a criterion for ranking processes based on their priority for implementing defined control or improvement measures, considering the PAF model assumption that higher costs imply lower quality and thus a higher priority for such measures.
