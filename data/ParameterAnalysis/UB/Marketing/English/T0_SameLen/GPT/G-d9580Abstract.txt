Upon reviewing the literature and conducting related research, it is found that only a few organizations have successfully identified and transferred project knowledge to future projects, and that project performance is closely tied to specific knowledge elements. Furthermore, it can be concluded that knowledge is generated through the learning process in each project, and that project knowledge management should be integrated with other project management processes. The primary reasons for inefficient project management in a project environment include: organizations focusing more on the task at hand than on the learning process, inadequate analysis of project success, and the process of documenting project results. Considering the lack of scientific support for using project result analysis and project success results, this doctoral dissertation focuses on analyzing project success and studying the impact of project success analysis results on knowledge management in a project environment. The dissertation also includes a synthesis and review of the theoretical foundation for the project success analysis concept, as well as empirical research that leads to the development of an integrated concept for measuring and analyzing project success. The empirical research was carried out in Serbia, with a sample of organizations focused on project management. The research demonstrated a significant link between how knowledge is collected and transferred from previous projects and how we define project success and document project success results. The research results also support the main hypothesis: Project success analysis based on measuring project performances, if done systematically, contributes to effective and efficient knowledge management in a project environment. By examining the research results, a systematic approach to project success analysis can be established, based on the relationship between the said elements and the need for their formalization. The concept presented here was implemented in a project focusing on information systems and technologies. Additionally, the dissertation also discusses the pros and cons of this concept by analyzing the said project.
