Negotiating, a complex and dynamic social process, aims to find a solution that allows all parties to achieve their objectives. Establishing a detailed and targeted communication system involves understanding information needs, their significance, communication methods, communication frequency, and effectiveness. The necessity for communication is validated by the requirement for information essential for successful negotiation, and an awareness of events that could impact value creation. This paper investigates and analyses the effect of marketing communication on business negotiation and value creation. The research issue of this doctoral thesis is centred on exploring the interactive and interpersonal connection between marketing communication tools and business negotiation stages as means of generating additional value. Viewing business negotiation as a business philosophy, where marketing communication is crucial, allows the company to reap numerous benefits or create value-added elements. By probing the target audience, it aids in gauging the impact of marketing communications and hence their influence on business negotiations. In this regard, empirical research was conducted to assess the contribution of individual communication channels, the phases of the negotiation process, and linear regression analyses were executed on the entire sample, segmented into buyers and sellers.
