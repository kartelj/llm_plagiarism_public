'This thesis examines the issues surrounding the B2B operations of electronic media. It delves into the intricacies of electronic media services, as well as the transformations brought about by contemporary e-business technologies in the utilisation of these services. The significance of customer relationship management in the B2B operations of electronic media is highlighted. Emphasis is given to the progressive methods and technologies for managing relationships with stakeholders in the electronic media industry. Moreover, the thesis explores ways to enhance relationship management between public broadcasters and their stakeholders through the use of cutting-edge e-business technologies like social media, digital and interactive TV, and mobile computing. A customer relationship model for the B2B operations of electronic media is proposed in the thesis. This model facilitates the adoption of sophisticated CRM concepts and services, and collaboration with stakeholders. Additionally, the potential for merging various media types and services into a singular electronic media business system is discussed. This proposed integration pertains to information, processes, application components, and human resources. In the experimental portion of the thesis, the proposed customer relationship model for the B2B operations was assessed. The assessment was carried out within the e-business system of the Radio Television of Serbia. The experimental findings corroborate the overarching hypothesis that the incorporation and integration of CRM into the business system of electronic media boost business performance, streamline all business processes of electronic media, and result in increased client satisfaction and loyalty.'
