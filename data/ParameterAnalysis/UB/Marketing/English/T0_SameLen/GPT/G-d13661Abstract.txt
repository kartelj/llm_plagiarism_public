The pharmaceutical industry is currently experiencing significant changes, a global trend filled with uncertainties and frequent shifts in strategies and judgments. The new millennium has introduced fresh challenges and opportunities in the social, political, and economic spheres. The journey from traditional medicine production to the modern pharmaceutical industry has seen significant changes, including the rise of large pharmaceutical companies in the 1950s, the thalidomide disaster of the 1960s, new managerial strategies in the 1970s, global integration and capital concentration in the 1990s, and the rapid development of biotechnology in the early 21st century. Over the past three decades, dynamic factors have propelled the pharmaceutical industry forward, preventing stagnation. Considering the conditions under which the pharmaceutical industry operates in Serbia, the global industry's development dynamics, and the lack of adequate strategic management and change management in this sector, this research focuses on managing strategic changes in the pharmaceutical industry, particularly in Serbia. This paper aims to analyze the pharmaceutical sector, its changes, and establish a framework for managing strategic changes in Serbia's pharmaceutical industry. It defines strategic changes and presents key strategic change management models, with a focus on Kotter's model. It also analyzes the fundamental elements and characteristics of the global and Serbian healthcare and pharmaceutical industries. Understanding the pharmaceutical industry requires knowledge of its key mechanisms and processes, including research and development, marketing and sales, and financial strategies. The paper also examines global pharmaceutical industry trends and challenges that significantly influence the development of Serbia's pharmaceutical industry. The Serbian healthcare and pharmaceutical markets have unique characteristics that are analyzed separately. European integration also brings significant changes to this strategically important field. The paper explores potential growth and development opportunities for Serbia's pharmaceutical industry and includes empirical research demonstrating the need for a systematic approach to improving change management in Serbia's pharmaceutical industry. Based on the results, a strategic change management model was initiated in Serbia's pharmaceutical industry to improve company operations and increase the health sector's efficiency.
