Modern information and communication technologies have facilitated the growth of teaching and learning opportunities through the use of innovative methods and tools to enhance e-education quality. Furthermore, smart learning environments and the Internet of Things have instigated changes in teaching and learning strategies, in both traditional and virtual community settings. The various emerging concepts of collective intelligence and collaborative learning remain somewhat undefined theoretically and methodologically within the realm of e-education and smart learning environments. Among these concepts is crowdsourcing, which leverages the collective knowledge and skills of a group to accomplish a task. Crowdsourcing has proven to be a successful innovation in education, scientific research, and problem-solving within education. The primary hypothesis developed and proven in this dissertation is that the creation and application of crowdsourcing models in smart learning environments enhance educational performance and quality, boost student motivation, and improve the end results of the educational process. In the experimental section of the doctoral dissertation, three research projects were conducted in two higher education institutions to validate the suggested crowdsourcing models in various educational settings. The evaluation results affirmed the significant potential of the proposed models and demonstrated students' readiness to cooperate, their problem-solving abilities, their capacity to produce quality solutions, and their high level of self-organization.
