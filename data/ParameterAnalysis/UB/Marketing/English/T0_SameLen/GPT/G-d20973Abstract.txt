This doctoral thesis focuses on advancing the methodology for building and assessing composite indicators, a task undertaken by experts from the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the Joint Research Center (JRC). Composite indicators are measurements created by combining individual indicators that assess various facets of a multi-dimensional concept, after assigning them weights and aggregating them. These composite indicators are increasingly utilized by decision-makers to rank and assess entities across diverse subjects. The OECD-JRC methodology offers valuable guidance for the intricate process of constructing the methodological framework for the composite indicator. However, the weighting method and the robustness and sensitivity analysis remain areas of ongoing interest. The weighting method proposed in this doctoral thesis aims to identify a weighting scheme that enhances the stability of the metric, as gauged by the sum of standard deviations of relative contributions of indicators. The bootstrap IvanoviÄ‡ distance (I-distance) is suggested to establish the model constraints, while the metaheuristics enhanced Scatter Search (eSS) is employed to resolve the defined optimization problem. This novel method considers the stability of the composite indicator during the weighting scheme determination process and suggests a data-driven weighting scheme that minimizes intuitivity and addresses the fact that robustness analysis is often overlooked in the construction and assessment of composite indicators. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed weighting method can be effectively implemented in the construction and assessment of composite indicators.
