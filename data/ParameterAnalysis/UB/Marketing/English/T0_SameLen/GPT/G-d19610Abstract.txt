This doctoral thesis research focuses on the evolution of customer relationship management (CRM) within the digital operations of intelligent libraries. The primary issue investigated in this study is the potential for incorporating the CRM system into an integrated library system (ILS) as a strategy for enhancing library interactions with patrons and stakeholders. To apply a CRM model in the digital operations of intelligent libraries, suitable for developing nations, this doctoral thesis explores a model based on open-source software. The model comprises the following elements: an integrated library management system, CRM system, intelligent technologies, mobile services, and social media services. A comprehensive analysis of the research findings in the CRM field is provided. The core section of the dissertation defines a model for managing customer relationships and a method for integrating it with the ILS. The suggested model outlines the infrastructure and architecture of the CRM system within the digital operations of intelligent libraries. In the experimental section of the thesis, research was carried out to investigate the application of CRM principles and intelligent technologies in libraries, and the readiness of librarians to adopt these technologies to enhance customer relationships. Based on the developed model, a system for managing customer relations in an intelligent library is implemented by integrating CRM systems into an ILS. The results obtained validated the primary hypothesis that incorporating CRM systems in the digital operations of intelligent libraries enhances library operations performance, optimizes library business processes, and improves patron communication.
