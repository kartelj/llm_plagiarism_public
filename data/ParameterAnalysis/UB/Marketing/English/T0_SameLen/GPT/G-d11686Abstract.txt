Designing a sufficient logistics network creates a suitable foundation for effective supply chain management. A well-functioning logistics network can also give a company a competitive edge, helping them navigate increasingly stringent environmental regulations and business uncertainties. The configuration of a logistics network (e.g. location, facilities, and technology facilities) is a crucial strategic issue in supply chain management, with a significant impact on overall performance. This paper presents research on integrated models of forward and reverse logistics supply. These integrated models, also known as closed-loop supply chains, are networks that incorporate traditional channels and logistics activities, as well as return channels. The development of an integrated logistics and reverse logistics network can reduce costs across the entire supply chain, increase profits, and help meet legal requirements related to environmental concerns. This paper posits that operations research methods based on mathematical models can effectively inform decision-making in a logistics system that includes supply and reverse processes. The research aims to further the development of an integrated model of supply logistics and reverse logistics. The challenge is to determine an integrated logistics network that combines logistics and reverse logistics supply, thereby enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of the entire supply chain. This dissertation presents five models that address the selection of locations and routes in integrated logistics models of supply and reverse logistics. These problems are tackled using multi-criteria analysis and heuristic methods. One of the location selection models is solved using the fuzzy AHP method. Four NP hard problems are addressed using heuristic methods. Heuristics based on the Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS) method are developed for mathematical models with one or more objective functions. Two algorithms are used for each of the four models solved using VNS. The Variable Neighborhood Descend (VND) is used for local search for all models. Problems with a small number of nodes are solved optimally, and the heuristic results are compared with the optimal solutions. Optimal solutions are presented to evaluate and validate heuristic solutions. The research findings indicate that the developed heuristics offer near-optimal solutions, and that heuristic execution time is significantly reduced. The anticipated results should be useful to researchers studying logistics principles and logistics as a science, as well as practitioners making logistical decisions in manufacturing companies.
