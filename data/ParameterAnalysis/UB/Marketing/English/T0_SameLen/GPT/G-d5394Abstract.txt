The doctoral thesis focuses on the information society, its growth, and methods for monitoring and assessing its progress. It compiles existing studies and theories on the information society, its evolution, various forms, growth factors, and numerous global initiatives aimed at directing its worldwide progress. The thesis explores ways to measure the information society, a complex concept defined by a group of interrelated indicators, and identifies the most suitable metrics for observing, measuring, and assessing its current state. Besides providing a classification and evolution path of the benchmarking indicators that form the basis of any methodology for quantifying the information society, the thesis includes a review of the most relevant methodologies used globally to evaluate the information society. However, the primary focus of this work is the creation of a unique model that outlines the necessary steps to monitor and assess the progress of Serbia's information society. This model assumes: • a theoretical foundation, • compatibility with European Union (EU) standards, allowing for its widespread use in international cross-country analysis and comparison projects, • adherence to the specificities of Serbia's information society and its existing investment and development opportunities. The model's formulation included: • selecting a set of Information Society Indicators (ISI) in line with EU standards, but modified to suit Serbia's characteristics and development potential, • transforming the ISI set to allow for their ranking based on their importance for monitoring the information society, • extracting the most relevant ISI subset, • defining a sub-model that quantifies the digital divide through a unique compound indicator - the Digital Polarization Index (DPI). The model was tested on Serbia, monitoring and analyzing its information society over five years. The verification process involved: • statistical monitoring, quantification, and relevant data analysis, and • analyzing the results to determine the current state, identify and quantify 'critical points' in Serbia's information society development, and predict its future progress. The thesis's professional contribution is the assessment of Serbia's information society development from both the population and economic perspectives. Additionally, the thesis contributes by quantifying and evaluating the intensity of the digital divide and its trends, and by targeting the most digitally underdeveloped groups within Serbia's population. The primary scientific contribution is the creation of a model for monitoring and evaluating the development of the information society. This model is based on the I-distance method and cluster analysis, two appropriately combined multivariate analysis methods. The initial set of indicators was reduced to the most relevant subset after ranking them based on their I-distance value and applying cluster analysis. This subset includes the most important indicators for assessing the information society based on 'information quantity'. By reducing the number of indicators while retaining valuable information content, the model's practical applicability has significantly increased. Additionally, the thesis defines a model for quantifying individual and total digital divides in various areas by introducing the digital polarization index. The model's main features are its generality, flexibility, and openness to adding or changing its basic components. This allows for the identification, definition, and calculation of various individual sub-indices of digital polarization used in calculating the total DPI (expressed by arbitrarily selected sets of indicators and arbitrarily determined subgroups of the sample). These model features are valuable given the rapid changes in the ICT area. The thesis's social contribution is the vast potential for applying its results in monitoring and quantifying the information society and guiding and harmonizing its development. The model can be used as a strategic decision support tool and a tool for observing and minimizing the digital divide. It can also support the evaluation of various complex social phenomena outside the information society framework.
