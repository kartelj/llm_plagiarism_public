The creation and enhancement of products and services can rejuvenate existing sectors and establish entirely new ones. Hence, the development and commercialization of novel technologies are crucial for the global economy. In this context, entrepreneurship is seen as a catalyst for economic and social growth, through the formation of new businesses, ideas, products, and services. Recently, social entrepreneurship has garnered the attention of numerous researchers and practitioners who recognize its impact on job creation and fostering a healthy societal environment. Technological entrepreneurship begins with assessing the market value of new discoveries and technologies and aligning them with current or potential market needs, with the goal of converting market opportunities into commercialized products, services, or new ventures. In this process, individuals who form teams to develop technological new ventures play a significant role. This organizational form is commonly referred to as a "technological startup" or simply "startup", and is defined as a temporary organization established to discover a sustainable and scalable business model. Startups also encompass early-stage ventures in the fields of innovation and cutting-edge technologies, characterized by high dynamism, growth orientation, profit, and the creation of new market values. Many entrepreneurs who develop new, technologically-based products and services within their startups possess extensive technological knowledge and skills. However, due to their focus on technology and product or service development, these entrepreneurs often neglect business orientation, which is frequently a primary cause of failure. This dissertation investigates marketing and marketing orientation as components of business orientation in the development process of technological entrepreneurial ventures. The objective of this dissertation is to develop a comprehensive model of the influence of marketing orientation on the success of technological entrepreneurial ventures during the startup phase. Marketing orientation is defined as an organizational culture that efficiently fosters organizational behavior and simultaneously creates superior customer value, which is seen as a prerequisite for successful business. The dissertation analyzes the effect of marketing orientation on the development process of technological startups through competition orientation, customer orientation, and interfunctional coordination. In addition to marketing orientation, the analysis also covers the concept of entrepreneurial marketing, examined through the components of entrepreneurial orientation: innovativeness, proactiveness, risk-taking, autonomy, and competitive aggressiveness. This dissertation includes an analysis and research of environmental impact, competitiveness level, and the role of mentorship in the development process of technological startups. It also examines the personal characteristics of successful entrepreneurs. Measuring the performance of technological startups, unlike established companies with a business history and large corporations, deviates from traditional success measurement methods and poses a significant challenge for both theory and practice. Based on a review of existing scientific literature and qualitative research conducted within a specific target audience, 13 development goals for technological startups have been identified. In quantitative research, the reduction of this scale's dimensions using the method of main components generated four success factors for the development process: success of idea and concept, success of value proposition, success of value exchange, and success of business model. The results of the quantitative research conducted and presented in this dissertation highlight the significant role and impact of several marketing and entrepreneurial orientation components on the success of the development process of technological startups. Additionally, the results elucidate the influence of environmental competitiveness and mentorship on the success of the development process. The final part of the research identifies the personal characteristics of successful founders of technological startups.
