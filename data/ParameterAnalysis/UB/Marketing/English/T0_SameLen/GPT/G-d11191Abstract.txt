The dissertation's focus is on the potential for creating a flexible, adaptable process performance measurement model. Modern organizational management involves process management, and the organization's objectives are contingent on the success of these processes. Key performance indicators are used to gauge process success. The research includes an examination of the interplay between top-tier organizational goals and process performance indicators in businesses that have adopted a process approach. The study of methods to enhance the flexibility and adaptability of the process performance measurement system involves an overview and analysis of existing performance measurement models and the creation of a unique, adaptable model. This development includes defining the model (structure elements, connections, and interdependencies), applying it in real-world scenarios, and refining it based on outcomes. The primary hypothesis established and validated in the dissertation is: Formalizing the interdependencies between top-tier organizational goals and key process performance indicators can enhance the flexibility and adaptability of business performance measurement systems. A scientific description and comparative analysis of current process performance measurement models were conducted based on a comprehensive literature review. Subsequently, the new GPI (Goal; Process; Indicator) model is suggested. This model allows for the direct identification of interdependencies between top-level goals and process performance indicators, and offers a degree of flexibility and adaptability. A case study research was then conducted. The previously conceptualized model was enhanced based on the study's findings. The research results and the proposed GPI model provide a foundation for improved, simplified performance management, as well as future research in this field.
