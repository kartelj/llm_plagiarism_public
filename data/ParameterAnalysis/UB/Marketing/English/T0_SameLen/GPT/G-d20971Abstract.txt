Stochastic programming, a subset of operational research, explores methods to integrate uncertainty into decision-making processes, acknowledging that decision makers may not always have immediate access to all necessary information. The primary challenge in applying stochastic programming stems from the uncertainty of model parameters and the fact that the optimal solution is determined for the deterministic equivalent (double) of the original problem. Another issue is assessing the quality of a specific deterministic equivalent from the standpoint of the criterion function value, which can be random, and from the probability of meeting stochastic constraints. Stochastic programming is utilized in numerous fields, with common applications in production planning, supply chains, logistics, transportation, portfolio management, marketing, finance, and more. Three prevalent strategies for solving stochastic programming problems are stochastic optimization, robust optimization, and chance constrained programming, which form the foundation of all research in this optimization field. Robust optimization is a conservative method focused on the worst-case scenario by defining a deterministic equivalent of the original problem that eliminates all model uncertainty. Chance constrained programming is a technique that addresses uncertainty in the model's constraint parameters and employs various methods to solve these problems. This approach assumes that a specific stochastic and uncertain constraint must be met with a predetermined probability. The development and application of this approach are driven by the need to articulate constraints in a way that the predefined probability of meeting constraints is essentially a risk that the obtained solution will not be met, a risk the decision maker is prepared to accept. The most challenging aspect of the chance constraint approach is tractability, primarily related to the ability to identify the appropriate probability distributions of the stochastic parameters. However, all these stochastic programming approaches are complementary methods for solving optimization problems with uncertainty, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. This dissertation's research area explores different methods for addressing uncertainty in mathematical models, i.e., developing a new approach for solving stochastic programming models. The dissertation's fundamental premise is that real-world stochastic programming problems can be effectively solved using a combination of classic deterministic optimization and simulation. The research aim is to contribute to the stochastic programming field by developing a new approach to solving weakly structured problems. Specifically, the dissertation proposes a novel method: the iterative optimization-simulation approach. This approach involves two stages: an optimization phase where the deterministic equivalent of the original problem is solved to optimality, and a simulation phase where the probability of meeting constraints is verified through simulation. Each deterministic equivalent represents a new scenario, which is verified using simulation power. If the decision maker is dissatisfied with the outcome, a new scenario of the original stochastic problem with new deterministic values will be established. The accumulated experience from scenario checking is used to contemplate and formulate heuristics as straightforward rules for scenario generation. The primary research goal is to use the optimal solutions obtained through this approach's implementation to solve stochastic models as effective managerial decisions that will facilitate the achievement of goals and the application of stochastic models to real-world problems. This dissertation's most significant contribution is defining a new approach to solving stochastic optimization problems, i.e., devising an efficient method for solving stochastic models using a simulation approach. In addition, we will propose a new scenario in solving stochastic optimization models that will facilitate a much simpler application of the appropriate algorithms in solving these models and implementing them in the real world.
