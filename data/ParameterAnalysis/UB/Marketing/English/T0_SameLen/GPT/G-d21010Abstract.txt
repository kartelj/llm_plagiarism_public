'Open badges, an emerging educational technology, acknowledge the accomplishments, abilities, attributes, and passions of an individual or group. Recently, there's been an increase in software systems utilizing the Open Badges Infrastructure (OBI), supporting diverse teaching, learning, and badging methods. However, their effectiveness in specific educational contexts can greatly differ, posing significant challenges for educators in selecting a system for a specific educational use. This study aims to suggest potential usability metrics - both general and technology-specific for OBI-compliant systems, which can be efficiently used when choosing this educational technology. The primary outcome of this research is a methodological framework that incorporates standard general usability metrics (e.g., perceived usability score based on System Usability Scale) and the technology-specific usability metrics developed within the research (e.g., 'ease of sharing badges' score, 'support for badge creation satisfaction' score, etc.). The suggested method has been tested in an empirical study using a mixed research method. The study's findings confirmed the effectiveness of the suggested method in the given context. It demonstrated that the suggested metric categories are complementary and that the metrics have satisfactorily differentiated the evaluated systems. Furthermore, the qualitative evaluation results highlighted the main usability issues of the evaluated systems. The method can be implemented in various educational environments, considering that the suggested metrics are relatively easy to gather and interpret.
