This study aims to introduce, scrutinize, and identify various real options, and investigate their impact on shareholder value creation. The objective, based on the results, is to suggest a novel equity valuation method for corporations with high risk and high flexibility. This study provides a summary of modern strategy concepts and connects them to shareholder value creation. By implementing a specific strategy, a company has various real options available. Literature review-based findings identified different indicators of flexibility and uncertainty, suggesting the potential existence of real options. These indicators were utilized to categorize corporations and identify those with valuable real options. Additionally, financial performance metrics of companies with high flexibility and high uncertainty were computed and their features were outlined. This PhD thesis recognizes and critically examines existing stock pricing models. Based on all results, excess return is associated with risk, real options, and generic strategies. This study uses panel data analysis. Various growth option definitions were applied to assess the sensitivity of the suggested method. Moreover, this method is validated by comparing predicted and actual excess return outcomes. Real options indicators are significant in explaining the risk-return relationship, but the market appears more cautious in valuing these options. A cost-leadership strategy enhances investors' excess return.
