The construction sector is vast and intricate. Given that a significant portion of construction tasks are carried out by contractors, the success of these projects largely hinges on their skills and qualifications. Thus, choosing a suitable contractor is a crucial task that requires a critical decision in each project. To do this effectively, it is advisable to carry out a prequalification process to assess their suitability before the bid awarding stage where the final selection decision is made. As this issue embodies a typical multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) problem, the AHP method was employed. The objective of this thesis is to suggest a model to assist the Libyan Central Committee of Tendering (hereafter referred to as the Committee) in prequalifying potential candidate contractors. The model was tested on four Serbian construction firms and comprises four criteria, namely, experience, technical capability, managerial capability, and human capability. A sensitivity analysis was conducted to verify the robustness of this model. We deduce that the suggested model can provide a dependable framework for the Libyan Central Committee of Tendering when making such a prioritization decision. Moreover, we can assert that the suggested model would operate effectively, producing satisfactory results, and succeed in making sensible decisions in the construction contractor prequalification process, which undoubtedly boosts the trustworthiness and transparency of bid awarding procedures in the nation.
