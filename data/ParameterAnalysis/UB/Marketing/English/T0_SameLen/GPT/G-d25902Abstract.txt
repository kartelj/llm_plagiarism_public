The doctoral thesis research topic is the creation of crowdsourcing models in intelligent cities utilizing Internet of Things (IoT) and mobile technologies. The primary research issue addressed in the dissertation is the potential use of crowdsourcing, IoT, and mobile technologies to enhance smart city services. The research concentrates on the analysis, definition, and execution of various crowdsourcing models to improve living standards in smart cities. The thesis primarily investigates the citizens' preparedness for the deployment of smart city crowdsourcing services. The initial phase of the research aims to identify those crowdsourcing services based on IoT and mobile technologies that will stimulate citizen participation. The research is focused on cities that have not yet fully adopted smart city standards. The method for assessing citizens' readiness was based on an analysis of crowdsourcing models like crowd wisdom, crowdfunding, crowdvoting, and crowdsensing, and their use in areas such as traffic, environmental preservation, utility services, and health. Data was collected in Belgrade over two years through a survey of 210 citizens. The findings suggest that citizens are willing to accept crowdsourcing services based on crowdfunding, crowdvoting, and crowd wisdom models. Moreover, the results show that citizens are interested in environmental conservation (crowdfunding services supporting solar energy development and environmental protection) and public transportation (crowdvoting and crowd wisdom services that can enhance public transport). The results, besides indicating priority services for implementation, could also provide a solid foundation for initiating other smart city projects. The suggested methodological approach and conclusions could also contribute to a broader framework for selecting implementation projects in other cities. The thesis introduces the development of the Smart Belgrade crowdsourcing platform, which aims to motivate citizens to collaborate and achieve shared goals through collective intelligence and an organized interactive online community. Citizens of the smart city can learn about current issues in ecology, utility services, and public transportation through the crowdsourcing platform. Registered users on the crowdsourcing platform can contribute to solving defined problems, propose new initiatives, post relevant information gathered using suitable mobile devices, and report city issues. In addition to the mentioned services, a crowdvoting service based on voting for initiatives has been implemented on the platform. The model proposed in this dissertation should enhance citizen information and participation in a smart city. In the thesis, the model evaluation was conducted to test the system and measure the relevant parameters that influence the effectiveness and utility of the proposed model. The gathered results support the main hypothesis that the development and application of crowdsourcing models based on IoT and mobile technologies enhance citizen participation in the process of collecting, disseminating, and using information in a smart city.
