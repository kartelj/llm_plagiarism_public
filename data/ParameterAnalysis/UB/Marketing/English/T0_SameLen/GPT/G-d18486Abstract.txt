The PhD thesis "Formulating Marketing Communication Strategies in Child-Focused Cultural-Educational Institutions" consolidates theoretical knowledge, built upon prior research on marketing communication strategies in cultural and child-focused educational institutions. It also includes practical knowledge gained from years of experience in a child-focused cultural institution established by the City of Belgrade, and numerous cultural projects for children and youth. The research aims to ensure equal treatment of child-focused cultural-educational institutions with other cultural institutions catering to an older demographic, considering the lack of comprehensive literature on this issue. The thesis addresses the problem of insufficient market-oriented thinking in child-focused cultural institutions, which directly jeopardizes the institution's survival and future growth. The research employed interviews, focus groups, surveys, and case studies, and analyzed both public and private child-focused institutions and organizations in Serbia and the region, in comparison to similar institutions outside the region. The paper examines the challenges of implementing marketing communication strategies and public relations, and demonstrates how child-focused institutions plan and execute these strategies. It provides successful real-world examples for a thorough comparison. The paper explores the unique nature of marketing communication in the culture and education sector, and the relationship between non-profit marketing and public relations, which is essential in non-profit cultural and educational activities. Child-focused cultural institutions must secure a competitive position, retain existing patrons, attract potential audiences, and stimulate cultural interest among the so-called non-existent audience. The lack of a sufficient audience is a barrier to the growth of cultural-educational institutions. By utilizing integrated marketing communications and public relations, child-focused cultural and educational institutions can collaborate with schools to foster cultural interest in children, establish cultural habits, and promote healthier adulthood. Theoretical and empirical research validates the paper's primary hypothesis: the successful market positioning of child-focused cultural and educational institutions requires the consistent implementation of marketing communication strategies. It is concluded that marketing is essential in the realm of culture and education, in its broadest sense. Despite the significant difference between the profit and non-profit sectors, fundamental marketing concepts can be applied to both, such as offering services/products that the user/customer desires and facilitating mutually beneficial exchanges.
