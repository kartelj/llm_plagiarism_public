This doctoral thesis investigates how non-repetitive manufacturing systems can enhance operational performance - specifically lead time and delivery reliability - through lean implementation. There are many instances of operational performance enhancement via lean implementation, primarily in repetitive manufacturing systems where lean was originally developed. Current research indicates a growing interest in applying lean to non-repetitive manufacturing systems. However, there are significantly fewer cases of operational performance enhancement in non-repetitive systems compared to repetitive ones. One major reason for this is that knowledge of lean implementation in non-repetitive systems is not as organized and systematized as in repetitive systems. Furthermore, there is no universal framework for implementing lean in non-repetitive systems that considers all specific manufacturing environment characteristics and lean characteristics. The primary aim of this research is to expand knowledge in lean manufacturing and examine the effects of lean implementation in non-repetitive systems by creating a unique and innovative model of lean implementation for non-repetitive systems. This will be based on analyzing past experiences and experimentally validating the model in a typical non-repetitive manufacturing company. Analysis and systematization of previous research in lean implementation in non-repetitive systems reveal an interest in lean implementation in these systems, but also problems caused by non-repetitive system characteristics that prevent lean implementation practices from being simply replicated from repetitive systems. To explore the potential for lean implementation in non-repetitive systems, this doctoral thesis reviews scientific literature for information on lean development, non-repetitive system characteristics, potential impacts of these characteristics on lean implementation, and potential solutions to problems in non-repetitive systems through lean implementation. Lean was developed in Toyota, a repetitive manufacturing system. There are significant differences in characteristics between repetitive and non-repetitive systems, largely due to the diverse needs met by the two types of systems, and consequently by different goals and activities undertaken to achieve those goals. These differences can significantly affect how lean is implemented in non-repetitive systems. Lean implementation is typically aligned with repetitive system characteristics, so it is necessary to design a custom approach to fit the characteristics of a specific manufacturing environment. Based on the analysis of lean implementation possibilities in non-repetitive systems, a unique lean implementation model for enhancing operational performance of non-repetitive systems was created. The model design followed two directions. The first was to develop a conceptual framework for implementing lean in non-repetitive systems, with the main goal being to provide a new overview and interpretation of lean principles in light of non-repetitive system characteristics, and to analyze the potential for using customized lean principles to actively shape the non-repetitive manufacturing environment. The second direction stems from the first, and represents the formalization of a model for lean implementation in non-repetitive systems. The model operationalizes customized lean principles, and suggests a method of applying lean principles in non-repetitive systems through a series of steps aimed at enhancing operational performance. To test the potential for enhancing lead time and delivery reliability in non-repetitive systems through lean implementation, the model was implemented in a typical non-repetitive manufacturing company. The potential was first tested through simulation, where the results show that model implementation can enhance lead time and delivery reliability. This was followed by empirical validation through actual model implementation in the company. The empirical validation results show that the operational performance of non-repetitive systems, specifically lead time and delivery reliability, can be enhanced through lean implementation. The contribution of this doctoral thesis is reflected in several key results: (1) a new lean implementation model, tailor-made to non-repetitive system characteristics, was created; (2) the potential of the lean implementation model for enhancing operational performance of non-repetitive systems was evaluated through simulation and empirical research; (3) the proposed model was assessed based on the evaluation of simulation and empirical research results; (4) the current state of lean-related research was reviewed, with special attention to lean implementation in non-repetitive systems; (5) previous research in lean implementation in non-repetitive systems was critically assessed; (6) recommendations for future research were provided.
