'This thesis proposal examines the backing for operational production planning in small to medium-sized businesses (SMEs). Particular focus is given to scheduling tasks, which are the most intricate planning issues at the operational stage. SMEs are the leading type of businesses in both Serbia and the European Union (EU-28). They are also the most common type of businesses in the manufacturing sector in Serbia and the EU-28 nations. Make-to-Order (MTO) production and production organization according to the process are the most prevalent forms of production in small and medium-sized manufacturing businesses, and the Job Shop scheduling problem is a crucial part of operational, i.e. short-term production planning in this group of businesses. Considering that operational production planning is directly and closely linked to the transformation of raw materials and semi-manufactured goods, which creates and adds value, we highlight the necessity to manage manufacturing resources adequately in the production process (materials, machines, tools, labour force, time, money - i.e. capital, information, market). The thesis proposal provides an overview of basic theoretical concepts: small and medium-sized businesses, support for SMEs, the process of management in SMEs, production planning, and resource management. Furthermore, the process of operational production planning is defined from the perspective of activities it includes. Production scheduling problems are viewed as one of the most common issues in the field of operational production planning. They involve scheduling products to machines, i.e. determining the sequence of tasks and activities that need to be performed on each of available machines. It also includes the determination of time slots for the start and end of certain manufacturing activities. The goal of an adequate schedule, i.e. sequence of operations, arises from the capacity constraints of production resources (workers, machines and other production equipment). Therefore, special focus is given to the enhancement of scheduling activities, to create an adequate operational planning process which is aligned with the needs of a specific business. VIII For operational production planning activities, typical problems that arise are presented (scheduling problem, work in process and inventory between operations problem, and a problem of determination of operational period length), as well as models, methods and, techniques used for solving these problems. As some of the problems are classified as NP-hard (Nondeterministic Polynomial) problems of operational research, finding the best solution, i.e. optimal schedule, is a very intricate problem. Therefore, in the literature, particular focus is given to the heuristic approach for solving these problems. In the literature review, based on quantitative and qualitative analyses of the scientific papers, the papers that are relevant to this topic are selected, and the scientific achievements in the observed field are recognized. Finally, using the critical review of the literature, the proposal of the new research project presented in this thesis is justified. In order to investigate the practical aspects of the studied problem, it is assumed that operational planning of production is not at the adequate level of development in Serbian SMEs. The results of the survey conducted on a sample of 79 companies indicate a modest knowledge and application of modern methods and techniques of operations management in operational planning and resource management in the production process. Based on that, it could be concluded that SMEs need an adequate support in the field of operational planning and management of resources in the production process. In the thesis, a model of support for operational production planning and resource management in SMEs is created, in a way to consist of six phases: investigate the problem of SME in the domain of operational production planning and resource management, define the goal of support, define the support package, define indicators for monitoring the application of support, provide the support, and analyze indicators of the performance of the provided support. Within the new research project, the scheduling problem in small-scale production is defined, and is typical for single product production (i.e. one-of-a-kind production). In the literature, this problem is known as a Dual Resource Constrained Flexible Job Shop. The observed problem is modelled in the numerical computing environment and programming language MatLab (Matrix Laboratory). To solve the problem, multi- IX objective genetic algorithm metaheuristic is used, known as NSGA-II (Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II) with criteria functions makespan (C ) and JIT. The max application of the metaheuristics, which significantly improved DRCFJS problem solving, is further on presented in the thesis.'
