The transition process in Central and Eastern Europe, including Serbia, necessitates the privatization of state and socially owned enterprises. Prior to privatization, these enterprises require restructuring, as evidenced by past experiences. Various restructuring activities aim to enhance company performance, efficiency, and shareholder value. This dissertation focuses on a restructuring methodology centered on key value drivers. It also discusses the definition of value, value creation measurement, and value creation models. The goal is to help management understand how to create value through restructuring decisions related to operations, financing, and investments. To create value, management should adopt strategies that increase return on invested capital, decrease risk, or combine both. The success of restructuring is gauged by the value created, i.e., the difference in equity value before and after restructuring. A company's equity value equals the present value of its discounted future cash flows and depends on both future cash flows and the weighted average cost of capital. To increase equity value, it is necessary to boost cash flows by increasing revenue, reducing costs, and improving asset turnover, and to decrease business risk and, consequently, capital cost. The appropriate sale method of equity can influence the realized equity price of companies undergoing restructuring when their equity is offered for sale to strategic and financial investors. This paper also examines public tenders and auctions as methods of selling equity of socially and state-owned enterprises undergoing restructuring and privatization. The research and analyses presented in this dissertation support the hypothesis that company restructuring can increase value and prepare them for sale to potential investors. The presented restructuring methodology also confirms the feasibility of creating a restructuring model based on key value drivers that can be applied to any company. Lastly, an analysis of privatization results in Serbia confirms that selling socially and state-owned enterprises is the most efficient privatization model in the late transition stage.
