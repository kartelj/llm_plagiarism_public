Conventionally, it was assumed that the purpose of business entities globally was profit generation. However, this assumption has been challenged in recent decades. Specifically, some profit-making organizations have gone bankrupt. This raises the question, "What is required for an organization's sustainability?" Studies conducted previously on this topic have proposed several models to aid in the development of a sustainable business strategy. The goal of this doctoral thesis was to devise a new sustainability model for organizations, utilizing multi-criteria decision-making models to aid in strategic decision-making. The study was conducted in multiple stages. The initial stage involved a literature review to gather information on indicators relevant to strategic decision-making. The subsequent stage involved examining indicators used in the Annual sustainability reports of top-rated global companies. By selecting 150 indicators, categorized into strategic perspectives based on the Balanced Scorecard, the study was conducted with the involvement of strategic decision-makers. The obtained results were analyzed using PCA and Varimax rotation to identify correlations and potential groupings among the tested indicators. It was found that eight perspectives could account for 69.38% of the total sample. Based on these findings, the indicators that best represented these perspectives were selected. In the following stage, the fuzzy DEMATEL method was employed to calculate the cause-effect relationship among the selected indicators. The findings indicate that an organization's sustainable strategy realization depends on eight perspectives, with the learning perspective, best represented by the Exchange of Organizational Knowledge indicator, being the most significant. The leadership perspective is the second most important, followed by sustainability, process, socially responsible business, growth/market, clients, and finances, in that order. Implementing the developed model should enhance an organization's sustainability prospects in the future.
