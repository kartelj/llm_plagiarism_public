Supply chain management involves planning all activities related to supply, including partnering and collaborating with chain partners. The bullwhip effect can result from poor coordination. Operational and behavioral factors can cause the bullwhip effect in supply chains. Most authors focus on operational causes, while behavioral causes are acknowledged as significant but under-researched. Behavioral causes can include personality traits. Despite literature stressing the need for collaboration among supply chain participants to minimize the bullwhip effect, no studies have examined the impact of the personality trait of cooperation. This thesis investigates the effect of participant cooperativity on supply chain costs using a tailored beer game and demonstrates how to establish a supply chain with cooperative participants. Participant cooperativity was assessed using a social value orientation questionnaire. The overarching hypothesis of the thesis was validated - enhancing participant cooperativity in the supply chain can aid in improving chain operations and addressing complex coordination issues. The research examined the behavioral phenomenon in the supply chain and analyzed communication and interaction among chain participants using transactional analysis, demonstrating how to enhance participant cooperativity in the established supply chain. Finally, the behaviors of cooperative participants that yielded positive outcomes were identified as conduct rules in the supply chain and incorporated into the simulation using Petri nets. This confirmed that Petri nets can accommodate various factors influencing supply chains, including personality traits, suggesting that simulations using Petri nets can substitute for actual experiments.
