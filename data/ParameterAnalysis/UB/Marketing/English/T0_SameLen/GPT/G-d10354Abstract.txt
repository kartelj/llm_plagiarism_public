Increasingly, organizations are expanding their operations to the global market. The rise of globalization and international business has led to a broader internationalization of human resource management. It is now widely acknowledged that effective human resource management is a crucial factor in the success of multinational companies. This doctoral dissertation tackles the challenges multinational companies face in managing diverse human resources in an international setting. The dissertation outlines and clarifies the fundamental issues of international human resource management, as well as the main activities, particularly those related to staffing and performance management. Multinational companies often encounter various challenges when conducting business in different countries. One of the most crucial decisions a multinational company must make concerns the standardization of human resource management activities. Multinational companies frequently need to adapt their human resource management policies, practices, and procedures to the specific environment of the foreign countries where they operate. The goal of this doctoral dissertation is to uncover how multinational companies carry out staffing and performance management activities and the degree to which they standardize human resource management policies and practices at headquarters and various worldwide subsidiaries, i.e., the degree to which they succeed in transferring these policies and practices from headquarters to foreign subsidiaries. The dissertation includes a literature review on international human resource management and the results of research focused on the standardization of human resource management practices in multinational companies. The dissertation includes empirical research conducted in subsidiaries of foreign multinational companies in Serbia, aiming to determine the degree to which multinational companies standardize their human resource management policies and practices in their Serbian subsidiaries, as well as to identify the variables that predominantly influence the possibility of transferring these policies and practices from headquarters to foreign subsidiaries. The findings from the analysis of data collected through the survey conducted in subsidiaries of multinational companies in Serbia showed that the surveyed companies mostly standardize their human resource management policies and practices, as well as performance management practices, but not staffing practices. Based on the research results, a new approach to human resource management was proposed, aiming to enable multinational companies to make the best possible decision on the degree to which they want to align their human resource management policies and practices with the practices at headquarters, or to adjust them to the local Serbian practices.
