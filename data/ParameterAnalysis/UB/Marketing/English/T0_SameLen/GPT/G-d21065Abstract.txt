This thesis focuses on the enhancement of Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) through the creation of a methodological structure, utilizing Ivanovic distance (I- distance) and resampling to establish the limits of virtual weights in the Global Assurance Region DEA model (GAR DEA). The study scrutinizes the challenges in assessing the efficiency of intricate systems. It also provides a review of the most commonly employed methods for efficiency evaluation, highlighting their specific pros and cons. The concept of weight restrictions in DEA is further explained. DEA is the most frequently used technique for determining the relative efficiency of complex entities by using diverse inputs to yield various outputs. The flexibility in setting the weights results in a considerable number of entities often appearing efficient, thereby reducing the method's discriminatory power. Moreover, some entities are evaluated based on a limited set of their indicators, while others are overlooked. The novel model rectifies the shortcomings found in traditional weight restriction models, where weight boundaries are determined by expert subjective evaluation. By employing the I-distance, a data-driven, significance assessment is achieved for each indicator involved in the relative efficiency estimation. The suggested model has demonstrated consistency and applicability to both profit and non-profit systems, as confirmed by the publication of academic papers where the new model has been used in the efficiency evaluation of banking and health systems. The model's successful application in two-stage DEA analysis is also demonstrated, particularly in situations where indicators are not directly controlled by the entity.
