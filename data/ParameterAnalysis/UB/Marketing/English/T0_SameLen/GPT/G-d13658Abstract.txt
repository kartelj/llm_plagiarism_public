The mining industry's continuous demand for innovative solutions and more efficient, dependable, and safer production methods throughout all production stages, from planning and design to the permanent halt of mining operations, promotes collaboration between the mining industry and research, science, education, technical equipment, technology, work organization, norm establishment, and standardization. Mining production outcomes are not solely reliant on natural conditions, workforce expertise, technical-technological equipment, industrial-economic, and socio-political environment. They significantly depend on the efficiency of oversight and management structures, or mining management. This understanding guided the selection and definition of the doctoral dissertation's theme presented here: it focuses on examining the impact of international standards on the Serbian mining industry. The research aims to assess global and national advancements in this area, explore the philosophy of management systems and international standards globally and nationally, and evaluate the adaptability and adequacy of management systems based on international standards when applied in the diverse conditions of the mining industry. Our research confirms the initial hypothesis that international standards are inadequate for effective mining systems management. Consequently, we propose a structural model incorporating international standards that sufficiently caters to mining management needs and aims to achieve exploitation, safety, production, and ecological security objectives. The issues addressed in the doctoral dissertation are both significant and urgent. The dissertation holds scientific and practical value for the mining industry, as evidenced by the research producing results in both areas.
