This study explores marketing tactics designed to foster consumer trust in a digital setting. To comprehend the conditions affecting these tactics, existing theories and literature on online commerce and consumer trust have been scrutinized, with a particular focus on elements that impact trust in a digital context. Through investigating trust elements, factors proven to affect online consumer trust have been identified. Drawing on these factors and existing theoretical models, a framework for cultivating consumer trust in a digital setting has been developed.
