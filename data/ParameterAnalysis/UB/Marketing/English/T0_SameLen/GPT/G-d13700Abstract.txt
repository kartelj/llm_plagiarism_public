This study aims to highlight the significance of the behavioral approach in decision-making processes within modern finance. Behavioral finance, a relatively new field of study, examines the impact of emotional, cognitive, and social factors on financial decision-making processes. It is an interdisciplinary study rooted in psychology and applied in the realm of modern finance. The goal is to underscore the need for practical application of behavioral finance, which, backed by psychology, elucidates how decision-makers arrive at their choices. It also scrutinizes behavior in business decision-making, bridging traditional finance and reality, as well as the methods financial actors employ in decision-making, taking into account all personal feelings and human limitations. Behavioral theory neither dismisses emotions from human behavior nor downplays the potent influence of emotions on decision-making processes in modern finance. Behavioral finance offers a deeper comprehension of investor behavior, managers, and events in a complex and uncertain business environment unfolding on financial markets. To assess the presence and extent of behavioral finance concepts in Serbia and Montenegro, a survey and three focus group interviews with financial managers were conducted. The aim of the focus groups was to develop a value orientation scale for financial managers, later used in the survey to gauge the prevalence of behavioral finance concepts in our financial institutions' practices. Twenty-three managers from Montenegro participated in three groups discussing manager performances, decision-making, value system, and behavioral finance. As a result, a seven-point grading scale of manager value orientations was devised, comprising 15 values and dependent on two factors: result-oriented values and moral values. The survey was conducted to identify the predominant decision-making styles of financial managers and to investigate the role of emotional competence and value orientations in shaping decision styles. Based on the findings from the research and focus groups, it can be concluded that managers are not sufficiently aware of behavioral finance theory concepts and that the insights these theories provide are not utilized in practice. Despite consensus on the importance of personality traits for success in this field, professional employment selection is scarce. When it does occur, these traits are not verified. The findings indicate that managers typically rely on rational decision-making style, contradicting behavioral finance theory's claim that humans are not always rational in decision-making. It should be noted that in our environment, emotions are often dismissed and reliance on rational reasoning is encouraged â€“ a notion long discarded in economically advanced countries. However, the research findings reveal that the formation of rational, intuitive, and evasive decision-making styles is influenced by emotional competence and values, partially validating behavioral finance theory's assertion that factors such as personality traits, value system, past experience, emotions, attitudes, motivation, among others, impact decision-making.
