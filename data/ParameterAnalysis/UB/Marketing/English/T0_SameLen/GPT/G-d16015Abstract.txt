'Conceptual reforms anticipated in the Republic of Serbia's approach to the European Union will prominently feature health-social system reform. It's clear that Serbia cannot solely depend on state health systems, primarily due to financial and organizational constraints. Therefore, private health institutions will undoubtedly play a significant role in Serbia's health system. Despite the presence of several such institutions, or even systems, in Serbia, this sector is evolving, and we can anticipate its dynamic growth in the future. Given these facts, the successful development of private health institutions will largely hinge on effective marketing and sales organization, and the anticipation of challenges these institutions will face in the emerging competitive landscape. Defining and developing a model of sales and marketing interdependence and its impact on development and brand positioning is a priority management task for private health institutions and systems. This paper aims to provide basic recommendations for their expectations, in line with past experiences and scientific research projects.'
