Tanja Milić's Ph.D. dissertation, “Strategic and Economic Aspects of Noble Organization Development with the Aim of Achieving Leading Position in Environment,” focuses on exploring the potential of a new concept aimed at enhancing organizational business and securing long-term prestigious leadership positions. The author posits that this objective can be realized through the development of the noble organization concept, an innovative model for attaining, nurturing, and preserving leadership positions. This model integrates all existing concepts related to the new primary purpose of companies, based on noble values in the company's relationship with its customers and stakeholders, as well as the company itself. The demands of the contemporary business environment necessitate the creation of new values and principles that will propel the organization or company to the top. The accelerated pace of scientific, technological, and social development, coupled with rapid globalization and market integration, consumer sophistication, and the growing abundance of goods, services, and resources required for their implementation, as well as the dramatic changes in the business and living environment caused by human activity in the early 21st century, necessitate that companies explore alternative methods of attracting customers and other stakeholders to achieve leadership positions. It is increasingly recognized that for an organization to achieve successful results, it must orient its actions towards its stakeholders, and within these relationships, strategies based on noble values must be implemented, according to the author of this dissertation. The noble organization concept is intended to foster stakeholder commitment, particularly consumer loyalty to the company, thereby ensuring long-term sustainable profit and leadership for the noble organization in comparison to other companies. Spiritual, noble motives, and an approach to the company's major stakeholders that focuses on their preservation and attention will help them “forget” about other companies, competitors, and bind to it as a noble organization, an organization that exists for them, which gives its best for their benefit and serves as their helper, support, and reliance, someone they can trust. This concept will ensure the realization of desired goals, which will ensure the achievement of high-quality, sustainable, stable, persistent profits and consistent growth and development for the organization. Even in times of economic crisis, when sales and profits may decline due to reduced consumer purchasing power, the noble organization will be in a better position than others, as it will retain the commitment and support of consumers and other stakeholders. With the first signs of recovery from the crisis, it will generate higher growth and profit compared to other companies. This doctoral dissertation describes the noble organization, its concept, its functioning, and its construction, and presents the results of research related to consumer response to certain noble aspects of the company and how these aspects affect their attachment to the company, as well as the stability and solidity of their relationship with the company. It also presents the results of research related to the intrinsic, current characteristics of the companies, as guidelines for further development in order to achieve a noble – a leading organization. Since this is a new concept and noble organization does not exist in practice, the research of the general public and representatives of business organizations, as well as best practices, is initially focused only on examining the impact and importance of certain noble business segments of existing companies and values, as well as their aspirations for a potential noble organization to approximate the results of the desirability of introducing the concept of the noble organization to business systems. The research results showed that noble values and the concept of the noble organization are highly preferred by the respondents of the general public. In terms of public attitudes towards noble organization, a very high percentage of respondents who expressed positive attitudes and behaviors and desired outcomes towards such an organization is viewed, which indicates the broad acceptance of potential noble organization that would emerge in the market, and thus the achievement of the leading position in the environment by such organization. Also, presented examples of companies that foster individual aspects of noble organization with excellent economic results achieved indicate the justification for the development and introduction of the concept of the noble organization to business systems. Results of descriptive statistics analysis indicate a high potential power of noble organization in relation to attracting and retaining stakeholders, and hence achieving high business performance, weakening the influence and importance of its competitors, as well as improving the world in which we live, by which initially set hypotheses are indicatively confirmed. Furthermore, research results of existing business organizations show that organizations that have in a greater extent and that value more noble values and business aspects are more successful economically than other organizations. Also, research has established a statistically significant difference in the evaluation of all tested values, virtues, and aspects of business by the public and by business organizations for the benefit of the public, which indicates the need to raise awareness of the importance and presence of observed values, virtues, and aspects of doing business in business organizations, as well as an open space for action, implementation, and application of the noble organization concept developed in this dissertation. The concept is explored from all aspects of the organization, and the final image of the noble organization is given with instructions of its operation, and development. It is expected, that this dissertation will open up an entirely new way, which companies need to follow, which will lead to a multiple increase of their inflows and profits, as well as maintaining the stability of their acquired positions, their very improvements, and improving the quality of life itself.
