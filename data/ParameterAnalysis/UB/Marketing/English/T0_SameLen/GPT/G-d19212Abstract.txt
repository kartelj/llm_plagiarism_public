This dissertation's primary focus is the examination of remote sensing methodology from the perspective of data collection and preparation for processing, specifically data processing using statistical methods for classification purposes, to identify specific phenomena. The research emphasizes proposing a methodology for defining the sensitivity zone in phenomena classification, primarily using multivariate analysis statistical methods. Remote sensing is generally defined as a scientific field and technique for gathering information about an object (typically the Earth's surface) without direct contact. It involves recording reflected or emitted energy (electromagnetic radiation, acoustics, etc.) from the object, processing, analyzing, and applying the information. Today, remote sensing is globally recognized as an interdisciplinary field. It is often combined with image processing disciplines and a geographic information system (GIS) for a broad range of geospatial science and technology. Therefore, this dissertation describes the connection between GIS and remote sensing, where GIS is a crucial tool in spatial data analysis. Each digital image consists of pixels, the smallest components of a single image, with recorded brightness and color spectrum, which we can view as individual entities of a statistical sample representing the image. In this dissertation, the classification of remotely-sensed data is particularly important and is used to identify and classify parts or pixels of the image. The classification is performed on multiple data sets, with the aim to assign each pixel of an image to a specific class based on the statistical characteristics of the intensity and color of the pixels. The term multivariate analysis is used to present a multidimensional aspect of data analysis. Many phenomena are described by various variables, and this certainly applies to data obtained by remote sensing where each pixel is typically represented in three or more different light spectrum bandwidths. Multivariate analysis is described as a set of statistical methods that simultaneously analyze multidimensional measurements obtained for each observation unit from a set of objects that we are examining. This dissertation describes the Data clustering techniques, which are, though, of less importance to the proposed method, and the Discriminant Analysis, which is at the core of the proposed method. Bayesian decision theory is described as a fundamental statistical approach to the problem of classification. The approach is based on the quantification of the compromise between different classification decisions using the probability and cost or effort that arise during decision-making. Bayesian decision theory assumes that the decision-making problem is set in a probabilistic context. Discriminant analysis deals with the problem of group separation and the allocation of vii observations in previously defined groups. In this dissertation, it is of particular importance the objective of discriminant analysis called classification, which refers to the establishment of a procedure for classifying observations based on the value of several variables in two or more separated, predefined a group. The dissertation reviewed the techniques used for the classification in the remote sensing. An introduction is made to the notion of digital images with theoretical foundations, as well as the basic techniques of their processing in remote sensing, and after a review of widely used classification methods which are grouped into two groups. The first is the Supervised classification, where the analyst identifies the parts of the image as representative samples of the surface types (class of information), which are called training sets, based on whose pixel’s spectral properties the algorithm “trains” to recognize spectrally similar areas for each of the class. Second, Unsupervised classification, in which case the spectral classes are grouped only based on their numerical data, and then the analyst deals with their validation and mapping into the information classes (when possible). When the remote sensing output is a classified map, it is essential to evaluate its accuracy. The most accepted method for estimating the accuracy in the maps generated by remote sensing is by comparison with reference data (known as “ground truth”). Regardless of the statistical method applied for pixel classification, it is clear that the classification should be considered with a certain level of classification accuracy, and for this reason, an overview of the techniques for measuring the accuracy of the classification is given. One of the aims of the research described in this dissertation is development of a methodology that will (by using the sensitivity zone) improve the overall classification accuracy, with the time and resources needed for running the classification will be reduced. In sixth chapter, the problem of classification was first discussed in more detail, with determining the sensitivity zone and overlapping level, and then the proposal of a new method to calculate and apply the sensitivity zone in remote sensing, as a result of the research work carried out during this dissertation, is given. The classification problem arises when the researcher makes the required number of measurements and wants to classify individuals into one of several categories based on these measures. The fundamental question is from which population is the given entity, in our case, the pixel, with specific measures. In the construction of the classification procedure, it is necessary to minimize the probability of the wrong classification, or more specifically, it is desirable to minimize the results of the effects of the wrong classification. The sensitivity zone represents the boundary values of categories and is defined in cases where we are unable to determine the category of entities. Therefore, in addition to determining categories of phenomena, it is also essential to determine the boundaries of these phenomena, i.e., identify those areas in which we can safely assume that entities belong to a defined category and those that cannot be presumed with certainty. By defining the methodology of determining the sensitivity zone, the problem is solved by identifying the elements that are in the border region, between the two categories, and viii one of the aims of the research described in this dissertation is exactly finding the appropriate method for determining the sensitivity zone in remote sensing, with the aim to improve the way in which the pixels are classified in the appropriate classes. In this dissertation, in detailed steps, the method for determining the sensitivity zone is described, and its advantages are highlighted in reference to other methods of classification of remotely sensed data. The benefits are primarily reflected in improving the accuracy of the classification and in reducing the total time and computing resources required. In the proposed method, the classification is carried out in two phases: in the first phase, a very fast method of determining the (hyper)plane of discrimination by the means of discriminant analysis is used, then the entities in the sensitivity zone are identified and in the next step pixels are classified using computationaly more complex classification using the k-nearest neighbors method (kNN). It also defines the method of measuring the accuracy of the classification. The seventh chapter presents the case studies and the possibilities of applying the sensitivity zone in the remote sensing for precision agriculture. The problem of separating the crops from the soli (or weeds or other objects, or anything that does not represent crops of interest) is described. The proposed method was tested in several different types of crops, and the results were compared with other classification methods in use, SVM, kNN (which is less used because of the performance issues on big amounts of data, but because of the accuracy was used as a reference) and LDA/QDA without calculating using the sensitivity zone. Considering the nature of the data tested, a contribution was made in particular to the possibility of analyzing images collected by unmanned aircraft, primarily in agriculture in the control of seasonal and perennial crops with the specificities that such an application carries. Finally, a conclusion was given with answers to questions related to the goala and hypotheses set, and the appendix briefly describes the developed software solution through which the research and data analysis was conducted.
