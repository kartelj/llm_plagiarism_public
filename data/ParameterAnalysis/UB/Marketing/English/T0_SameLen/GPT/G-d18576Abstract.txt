In the fast-paced and competitive business landscape, corporations and their leaders are compelled to swiftly adapt to market shifts, concentrating on identifying methods to generate new value and optimize returns on investments in knowledge and technology. Businesses and their leaders are seeking out technologies and knowledge that will revolutionize their operations and enhance their global competitiveness. Management is striving to capitalize on available potential technologies, recognizing the importance of incorporating ICT and the Internet into their operations to boost productivity, efficiency, and effectiveness. To thrive in this new environment, companies must alter their existing organizational structures, reevaluate their strategies, revamp their business processes, and establish the necessary technology infrastructure to efficiently support business processes and yield returns on investments. Cloud computing is typically segmented into three components within the service, platform, and infrastructure (SPI) model, each delivered as a service. This concept extends to the point where a provider offering software as a service can utilize platform or infrastructure as a foundational service. This is a layered cloud system. In addition to public and private cloud systems, hybrid cloud systems exist. If resources in the private cloud are inadequate, expansion to the public cloud can be made to meet the required resources. This study concentrates on identifying the optimal cloud solution and conducting an analysis and evaluation of business solutions and underlying technologies. The primary contribution of this thesis is a decision support expert system that includes a model for selecting virtualization technologies for constructing cloud systems.
