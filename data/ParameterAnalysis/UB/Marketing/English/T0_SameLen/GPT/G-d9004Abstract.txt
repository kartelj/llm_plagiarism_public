Financial institutions can enhance their effectiveness, safety, and profitability in both local and global markets through integrated financial risk management. This work offers a succinct overview of the role, significance, and implications of modern financial risk management activities, particularly focusing on financial risk models. Financial institutions, including deposit and non-deposit entities, as well as financial intermediaries and service providers, face various risks such as credit, interest rate, solvency, liquidity, market, operational, and technological risks. The accumulation of these risks can lead to horizontal and vertical spread of contagion, pushing the financial institution towards severe losses, even bankruptcy. Most financial risks are diverse and intricate, potentially causing disproportionately large losses when interacting with other risks, thereby continually amplifying their effects. Implementing a risk management strategy, utilizing information and communication technologies, is crucial for financial institutions to identify, measure, adjust (if needed), and manage the uncertainty of all existing risks using innovative methods, financial derivatives (forwards, futures, options, swaps), securitization, and other tools. This allows financial institutions to engage in ventures that offer an acceptable return relative to the risk, thereby fostering a business environment conducive to value creation and growth for its owners (stakeholders). Changes in financial institution regulations, particularly in the banking sector (Basel II and Basel III), have strongly influenced these shifts, tying the amount of capital to the expected level of credit risk and other risks, such as market, operational, or liquidity risk.
