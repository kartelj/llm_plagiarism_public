With rapidly evolving and competitive market situation, companies and their management are forced to a fast adaptation to the market changes and hence to focus on discovering ways of creating new value and maximizing the return on investments in knowledge and technology. Companies and their management are looking for technologies and knowledge that will change the way they are doing business and ensure increased competitiveness on the global markets. Management is trying to leverage the potential technologies available, aware of the necessity of implementing ICT and the Internet in their business in order to increase their productivity, efficiency and effectiveness. If the companies could succeed in new surrounding they must change current organizational structures, redefine their strategies, business processes, build technology infrastructure necessary in order to support efficiently business processes and provide return on investments. Cloud computing is most offten divided in three segments within service, platform and infrastructure (SPI) model where each is being delivered as a service. This concept goes to the extent of someone offering software as a service can use platform or infrastructure as an underlying service. This is a cloud on top of a cloud system. Besides public and private cloud systems, there are hybrid cloud systems. If we have insufficient resources in the private cloud, we can expand to public cloud for as much resources are required. This paper is focused on finding optimal cloud solution and performs analysis and evaluation of business solutions and underlying technologies. Main contribution of this thesis is a decision support expert system containing a model for selection of virtualization technologies for building cloud systems.
