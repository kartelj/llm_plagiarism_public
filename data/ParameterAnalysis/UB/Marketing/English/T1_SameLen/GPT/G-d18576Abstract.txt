As markets quickly morph and competition increases, corporations and their executives must swiftly adjust to shifts in the market, proactively seeking methods to generate new worth and augment returns on tech and knowledge investments. Businesses and their leaders seek knowledge and technology that can revolutionize their operations and heighten their international competitiveness. Management strives to capitalize on existing technology, recognizing the importance of incorporating ICT and the Internet into their operations to boost productivity, efficiency, and efficacy. To thrive in this new environment, companies must alter their organizational structures, redraft their strategies, streamline their processes, and develop the necessary tech infrastructure to support efficient business operations and yield return on investments. Typically, cloud computing is categorized into three segments: service, platform, and infrastructure (SPI) in a model where each is provided as a service. This system extends to the extent that a software-as-a-service provider can use the platform or infrastructure as an ancillary service. This constitutes a layered cloud system. Beyond public and private clouds, hybrid variants also exist. If a private cloud lacks adequate resources, it can be expanded to a public cloud as needed. This study examines the most efficient cloud solutions and assesses underlying technologies in business solutions. The significant contribution of this thesis is an expert system for decision-making support, which comprises a model for selecting cloud-building virtualization technologies.
