Logistics network design adequacy fosters a suitable setting for effective supply chain management. Besides, an efficient logistics network aids in gaining a competitive edge for a company, enabling it to adhere to ever-increasing, strict environmental regulations and business uncertainties. The configuration of a logistics network, including facilities location and technology, is one of the significant strategic factors in supply chain management, profoundly affecting its overall performance. The paper introduces integrated forward and reverse supply chains models as its research subject. These integrated models, otherwise known as closed-loop supply chains, comprise traditional channels, logistics activities and flows, and the return channel. The integrated logistics network development rationale includes cost reduction across the entire supply chain, profit increment, and achieving specific objectives concerning legal compliance and environmental concerns. The paper proposes the viable application of operations research-based methods, using mathematical models for effective decision-making in a logistics system also incorporating supply and reverse processes. The research aims to develop an integrated supply and reverse logistics model. The problem at hand is integrating the logistics and reverse logistics supply network to enhance efficiency and effectiveness throughout the supply chain. The dissertation presents five models addressing locations and routes selection issues in integrated logistics supply and reverse logistics models. Multi-criteria analysis and heuristic methods are employed to solve the problems, with fuzzy AHP method applied to resolve one location selection model. Four NP-hard problems were tackled with heuristic methods. Heuristics based on Variable neighborhood search(VNS) technique were developed for mathematical models with single or multiple objective functions. Two VNS-based algorithms were implemented for each of the four models. Local search Variable neighborhood descend (VND) was applicable to all models. Smaller nodes issues were optimally resolved and heuristic obtained results compared with optimal solutions. Optimal solutions were presented to evaluate and authenticate solutions from heuristics. The research findings demonstrated that the developed heuristics offered near-optimal solutions and significantly reduced execution time. It is expected that these results shall be beneficial to researchers in logistics and practitioners making logistics decisions in manufacturing companies.
