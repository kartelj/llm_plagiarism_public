Upon reviewing literature and conducting relevant research, it is found that only a handful of organizations have successfully and systematically identified and transferred project knowledge to subsequent projects, and that project outcomes are closely tied to specific elements of knowledge. Furthermore, it can be inferred that knowledge is generated through a continuous learning process within each project, and project knowledge management should be incorporated with other project management processes. The primary reasons of inefficient project management within project environment include: more focus on task accomplishment rather than the learning process, insufficient evaluation of project success and the process of documenting project results. Considering the lack of robust scientific backing for project success analysis and project result utilization, this PhD dissertation is centered on the investigation of project success and the study of the impacts of project success analysis on knowledge management within project environment. The dissertation also includes a synthesis and overview of theoretical fundamentals of project success analysis along with an empirical study that leads to the formation of a comprehensive concept for measuring and analyzing project success. The empirical study was carried out in Serbia, using a sample of project-based organizations. The study provided evidence of a significant correlation between knowledge accumulation and transmission from past projects and how project success and its results are defined and documented. The study also corroborates the main hypothesis: consistent project success analysis based on project performance measurement substantially aids in effectual and efficient knowledge management within the project environment. Observing the study results, a systematic method of project success analysis can be devised, highlighting the relationships among the components and the necessity for formalizing them. The proposed concept was executed in a project focusing on information systems and technologies. Additionally, benefits and drawbacks of the given concept are discussed in the dissertation by an analysis of the aforementioned project.
