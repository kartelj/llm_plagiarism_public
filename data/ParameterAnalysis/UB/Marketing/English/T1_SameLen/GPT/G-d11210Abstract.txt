The goal of this doctoral thesis is to formulate hybrid models to enhance the process of multi-criteria decision making. Current tools aiding multi-criteria decision-making have been deemed trustworthy and effective. However, their key flaw, observed through analysis, is their insufficient focus on mutual comparison, conditionality and logical dependencies among the decision-making attributes. Consequently, the thesis presents multi-criteria models capable of addressing decision problems. These are built on a mix of classical and fuzzy multi-criteria analysis techniques, and the utilization of the interpolate Boolean algebra. The central hypothesis of the thesis postulates that combining interpolate Boolean methodology, fuzzy logic and multi-criteria analysis approach can model the decision-making process more accurately than simply using a single multi-criteria analysis method. Classical multi-criteria analysis techniques are commonly used to address decision-making dilemmas, yet fall short in providing suitable frameworks for presenting uncertain/imprecise attributes. Such conditions are conducive to the growth of fuzzy set theory, which facilitates analysis of uncertain attributes using fuzzy numbers. Thus, this doctoral thesis contains hybrid models merging classical and fuzzy multi-criteria analysis methods to address identified shortcomings and yield more reliable outcomes. Moreover, models are proposed founded on interpolate Boolean algebra, which involves logical attribute interactions. This broadens decision-maker linguistic statement capabilities and enables a more realistic problem depiction. Proposed models were tested on examples of ranking business banks and telecommunications equipment suppliers. An integrated model, combining classical and fuzzy multi-criteria methods, is proposed to tackle the business bank selection problem. Conversely, a model mixing a two-stage multi-criteria analysis method and a hybrid model incorporating logical attribute interaction analysis using Boolean algebra, consistent with all Boolean laws, is put forward to solve supplier ranking problem. Research results show that a combination of multi-criteria methods can overcome the limitations of classical methods and exceed the outcomes of individual multi-criteria techniques. Furthermore, the implementation of interpolate Boolean algebra can model attribute interactions and dependencies, thus making it considerably simpler for decision makers to effectively illustrate the actual decision-making issue. The doctoral thesis primarily contributes towards enhancing the decision-making system via the formulation of blended multi-criteria models under situations where decision-making attributes are indeterminable, and when conditionalities and logical interactions are present among them. The underlying motivation for this paper lies in its practical application in genuine business systems.
