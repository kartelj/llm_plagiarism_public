The doctoral research aimed to ascertain if room existed for the innovation or enhancement of existing knowledge management models, allowing a comprehensive understanding of all connections between social capital and knowledge management. This was based on prior theoretical discoveries pertaining to key attributes of social capital within the framework of organisational knowledge management. An examination of relevant literature unveiled a significant range of reciprocal relationships and influences, which informed subsequent empirical studies in the non-profit sector, particularly civil society organisations operating within the European Union and the Western Balkans. The investigation revealed not only the primary features of these organisations' internal and external networking activities and their knowledge management maturity level, but also confirmed all theoretical suppositions and identified certain peculiarities. Noteworthy was the prevalence of internal social capital aspects over external ones, suggesting that CSOs may favour connections originating from within their organisations at the individual level and characteristics found in relational, cognitive, and nodal dimensions. Consequently, external social capital, particularly structural forms that create and nurture it, had not been adequately identified and thus represents an area needing substantial improvement. These peculiarities were evident when social capital dimensions and elements were juxtaposed with knowledge management phases, quality, and maturity. Empirical research suggested that social capital elements could be incorporated into existing knowledge management models, but limitations, particularly their lack of process-based functioning, indicated that the utilisation of project-based models might be more efficient. A modified Gasik model was employed to clearly illustrate how social capital could be integrated into the knowledge management process. The practical implementation of this integrated model was examined in relation to how it could facilitate a new organisational paradigm for CSOs, whereby knowledge is viewed as a critical precursor to competitive and sustainable operation.
