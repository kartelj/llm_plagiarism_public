Stochastic programming, a facet of operational research, studies how to integrate uncertainty into decision-making, acknowledging that decision-makers may lack all necessary information. The main challenge in applying stochastic programming is the model's uncertain parameters and the need for a deterministic equivalent (double) of the original problem for the optimal solution. It's also tricky to assess a particular deterministic equivalent's quality in terms of the criterion function's value, which could be random, and the probability of meeting stochastic limitations. Stochastic programming is employed in numerous fields, including production planning, supply chains, logistics, transportation, portfolio management, marketing, finance, and others. Three common strategies for confronting stochastic programming issues are stochastic optimization, robust optimization, and chance constrained programming, which serve as the foundational pillars for research in this optimization subset. Robust optimization is a conservative strategy that anticipates worst-case scenarios by defining a deterministic equivalent that eradicates all uncertainty from the model. Chance constrained programming, on the other hand, focuses on the model's uncertain parameters and employs various techniques to resolve these problems. The core presumption is that a particular constraint, which is unpredictable and uncertain, must meet a specified probability. The incentive to devise and implement such an approach lies in its necessity to frame the constraints in a way that the specified probability of meeting constraints signifies the risk of achieving a non-satisfactory solution, a risk that the decision-maker is willing to undertake. The predominant and daunting part of the chance constraint is tractability, which largely depends on determining the correct probability distributions of stochastic parameters. Regardless, all of these stochastic programming strategies are mutually supportive ways of approaching optimization problems with uncertainty, each with its own advantages and pitfalls. This dissertation's research area explores different methods of managing uncertainty in mathematical models, striving to devise a new approach to resolving stochastic programming models. It asserts that combining deterministic optimization with simulation can effectively address real-life stochastic programming challenges. The research aims to enhance stochastic programming by devising a new method to tackle loosely structured problems. Specifically, it introduces the iterative optimization-simulation method. It's a two-phase approach: an optimization phase that fully solves the deterministic equivalent of the original problem, and a simulation phase to verify constraint satisfaction through simulation. Each deterministic equivalent becomes a new scenario, which is then verified using a simulation. If the scenarios fail to satisfy the decision-maker, they formulate a new original stochastic problem scenario with new deterministic values. Insights gained from checking scenarios are employed to think about and establish heuristics as simple rules for generating scenarios. The primary research objective is to utilize optimal solutions achieved through this method as sound managerial decisions to meet goals and implement these stochastic models in real-life contexts. The dissertation's most significant contribution is to establish a new approach to solving stochastic optimization problems, specifically, creating an efficient method for solving stochastic models through simulation. Beyond this, it puts forward a fresh scenario for solving stochastic optimization models that will simplify the appropriate algorithms' application in resolving these models and implementing them in the real world.
