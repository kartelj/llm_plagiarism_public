The doctoral research explores the creation of crowdsourcing models in smart cities via Internet of Things (IoT) and mobile technologies. The pivotal question addressed in the thesis is the application of crowdsourcing, IoT, and mobile technologies to advance smart city services. The research prioritizes analyzing, defining, and implementing various crowdsourcing models to enhance living standards in smart cities. The thesis fundamentally probes into citizens’ preparedness for adopting smart city's crowdsourcing services. The initial stage of the research identifies crowdsourcing services powered by IoT and mobile technologies that spark citizen engagement. The cities studied are yet to fully comply with smart city standards. The methodology used to assess citizens' preparedness relied upon analyzing crowdsourcing models like crowd wisdom, crowdfunding, crowdvoting, and crowdsensing, and their use in different sectors such as traffic, environment, utilities, and health. Data extracted from a sample of 210 citizens through a two-year survey in Belgrade. The findings revealed readiness of citizens to utilize crowdsourcing services and an interest in environmental conservation and public transportation. These findings, indicating priority services for implementation, could also kick-start other smart city initiatives. The proposed methodology and outcomes could be incorporated in a broader structure for project selection in other cities. The research introduces the crowdsourcing Smart Belgrade platform's evolution, which aims to form citizen teams working collectively and harmoniously on an organized online community. The platform keeps citizens informed about ecology, utilities, and transportation issues. Registered members could contribute to problem solving, propose new initiatives, upload pertinent information gathered using suitable mobile devices, and report city’s problems. Additionally, crowdvoting service (voting for initiatives) has been set up on the platform. The proposed framework in this research seeks to improve citizens' involvement and informational knowledge in a smart city. Lastly, system evaluation was conducted in the thesis to gauge relevant parameters influencing the proposed model's effectiveness and usability. The collated results affirm the central hypothesis that employing crowdsourcing models powered by IoT and mobile technologies enhances citizen engagement in gathering, circulating, and utilizing information in a smart city.
