'This thesis proposal examines the support for operational production planning in small to medium-sized businesses (SMEs). It particularly focuses on scheduling activities, the most intricate planning challenge at the operational stage. In both Serbia and the European Union (EU-28), SMEs are the predominant business category. They are also the most common type of businesses in the manufacturing sector within Serbia and the EU-28 countries. Make-to- Order (MTO) production and production organization as per process are the prevalent production forms in small and medium-sized manufacturing firms. The Job Shop scheduling issue is an inherent aspect of operational or short-term production planning in these enterprises. Given that operational production planning ties closely to the transformation of raw materials and partially finished goods, it is essential that manufacturing resources are managed correctly in the production process. The thesis proposal outlines basic theoretical principles: SMEs, SME support, SME management process, production planning, and resource management. It also delineates the operational production planning process in the context of its encompassed activities. Production scheduling challenges are viewed as one of the more frequent issues in operational production planning. This includes scheduling products to machines, and determining time frames for the initiation and end of specific manufacturing activities. The aim of a well-planned sequence or schedule arises from production resource constraints. Therefore, improving scheduling activities to better sync with an enterprise's specific needs is paramount. Operational production planning issues such as scheduling problems, work in process and inventory between operations issues, and issues of operational period length determination are outlined, along with the models, methods and techniques for addressing these. Some problems are deemed NP-hard (Nondeterministic Polynomial) problems of operational research, therefore, finding an optimal schedule can be extremely challenging. Accordingly, the heuristic approach for solving these issues is given prominence in the literature. Based on a review of literature, selected papers pertaining to this topic are analyzed and scientific advances acknowledged. Further, after a critical review of the literature, this dissertation's new research project proposal is justified. Results of a survey conducted on a sample of 79 companies highlights the need for support in operational planning and resource management. The dissertation concludes with the development of a model for operational production planning and resource management support in SMEs. The examined scheduling problem in small-scale production, typical for single product or one-of-a-kind production, and known in literature as the Dual Resource Constrained Flexible Job Shop, is defined and modelled numerically in the programming language MatLab (Matrix Laboratory) using NSGA-II (Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II) metaheuristic to solve.'
