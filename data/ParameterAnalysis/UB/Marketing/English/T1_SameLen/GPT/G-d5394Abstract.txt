This doctoral dissertation is centred around the information society, its progression, and mechanisms for gauging and evaluating its development. It compiles existing studies and theories about the information society, detailing its evolution, forms, growth factors and international initiatives aimed at steering its global progress. It studies ways to measure the information society, a complex, multifaceted concept, and identifies the best measures for assessing its current state. The dissertation provides an outline of key methodologies used globally to assess the information society, and a taxonomy and historical account of benchmarking indicators essential to quantifying the information society. A primary aspect of this study is the development of a unique model outlining the necessary actions to monitor and measure Serbia's information society's advancements. The model stipulates: a theoretical basis, EU compliance for broad, international use, and accommodation for the Serbian information society's unique aspects and opportunities for further development. The model integrates: selection of Information Society Indicators (ISI) consistent with EU standards, but modified to suit Serbia's specifics, transformation of the ISI to allow significance ranking, extraction of important ISIs and defining a sub-model to quantify the digital divide using the Digital Polarization Index (DPI). The model is validated using Serbia's information society over five years. The verification process involved statistical monitoring, quantification and data analysis, and evaluation of results to establish the present state, identify and measure 'critical points', and predict future progression. The dissertation's professional contribution is its evaluation of Serbia's information society development from population and economic perspectives and its quantification and appraisal of the digital divide and its trends. It specifically targets the digitally under-developed sectors in Serbia's population. Its primary scientific achievement is formulating a model using the I-distance method and cluster analysis for monitoring and evaluating information society development. Indicator quantity decreased while maintaining valuable information for assessment. This improves the model's practical applicability and its ability to quantify total and individual digital divides by introducing the DPI. Its general, flexible design allows addition or modification of its fundamental components, offering the potential to identify, define, and calculate various DPI sub-indices. This adaptability proves valuable given the rapid changes in ICT. The dissertation's societal contribution lies in its applicability potentials, aiding the monitoring and quantification of the information society and guiding harmonious growth. It acts as a strategic support tool for decision-making and minimizing the digital divide, and supports evaluation of multifarious social phenomena beyond the information society's scope.
