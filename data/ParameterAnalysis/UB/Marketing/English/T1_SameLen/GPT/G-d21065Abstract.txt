This thesis revolves around establishing a methodological structure that enhances Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) via the incorporation of Ivanovic distance (I-distance) and resampling, which is mainly for deriving the limits of hypothetical weights in the Global Assurance Region DEA model (GAR DEA). The analysis conducted in the dissertation aimed at the challenges that arise when attempting to gauge the efficiency of complex systems. A synopsis of the most favored methods for efficiency evaluation, along with their respective pros and cons, is given. Details on weight constraints in DEA are also expounded. DEA is predominantly employed for assessing the relative efficiency of complex bodies via diverse inputs used to yield a variety of outputs. The autonomy in ascertaining the weights results in a significant proportion of entities often being perceived as efficient, thereby reducing the method's discriminatory strength. At the same time, a few entities' assessment depends solely on a limited set of indicators, while the rest get overlooked. The novel model rectifies lapses in traditional weight constraint models, whereby weight boundaries stem from experts' subjective evaluations. With I-distance in use, a data-driven significance evaluation is acquired for each indicator implicated in the relative efficiency assessment. The suggested model has demonstrated reliability and feasibility in profit and non-profit driven systems, a fact reinforced by the publication of scholarly articles that have employed the new model in bank and health systems' efficiency evaluations. It is also demonstrated that the model has successful implementation in two- stage DEA analysis in situations where there are indicators not directly controlled by the entity.
