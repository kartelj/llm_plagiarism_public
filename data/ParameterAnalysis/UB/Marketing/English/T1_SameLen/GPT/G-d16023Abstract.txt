Information technology (IT) powers today's society and business progression. It sparks transformations within business structures and how an organization operates. The enlarged use of certain skills, techniques, and methods in project management enhances management systems in institutions aiming to carve out market competitive advantages. Organizations' IT project management involves harmonizing IT and business strategies to meet internal and external stakeholders' needs. IT incorporation and sophistication level are reliant on an organization's capacity and approaches adopted during business strategy actualization. Developing a successful IT strategy demands an effective implementation method. The deployment of competence and capacity appraisal systems allows organizations to establish a quality base for value creation utilizing IT. Maturity models are contemporary tools for assessing organizational competence and capacity in project management. Past research findings and academic and professional community studies reveal two trends in organizational maturity analysis. The application of broad maturity evaluation models on different project types led to ignoring competencies unique to specific industries. Maturity models used in IT industries overlook analysis of project and organizational competencies and capacities. The goal of this dissertation is to design a comprehensive model for organizational maturity assessment encompassing both evaluation systems. In order to create a comprehensive IT project management model, primary data have been utilized collected from quantitative and qualitative empirical research. The study incorporated organizations that have a well-defined IT component in their business strategy. The research process encompassed a 360 degree analysis and appraisal of the organization from IT experts, project managers, executives, investors and final users' perspectives. This is a first-class experiment conducted in the Republic of Serbia, and only fragmented results are available internationally for some general and specific aspects of evaluation. The research findings verify the main hypothesis i.e., it's feasible to devise a model grounded on competencies, processes, documentation, management systems, and metrics for IT project management. These elements impact the delivered value, knowledge management, project performance, and project management organizational structure. Based on the suggested model, we've developed reference measures for six maturity levels. These measures allow us to juxtapose Serbian organizations against their best-practice IT project management. Moreover, the proposed model can be applied modularly, subject to organizational needs and market requirements. This comprehensive IT project management model can be advantageous to academia and the professional community. The proposed model can aid in improving and widening theoretical frameworks and approaches for maturity assessment, evaluating organizational competencies and capacities in IT project management, and establishing the strategic course for organizational growth.
