The focus of this PhD research paper is the creation of an intelligent library system, which utilizes big data technology and its related services. The main research problem tackled within the thesis is the construction of big data foundation and intelligent library services, which allow for smart search and recommendations from the library collection. The central scrutiny of the study is how the developed model can be integrated into a smart learning atmosphere to elevate the educational process's quality aspect. The paper puts forth a representation of the smart library as a vital educational system component, geared towards enhancing the quality and scope of learning resources, and spearheading user motivation through content-aware suggestions. The model detailed in the thesis ponders the feasibility of implementing a big data system for collating, analyzing, processing, and visually representing data from various sources, as well as integrating said data into the smart library. The primary objective of creating a smart library is to refine the library's operational protocol, providing users with innovative methods of search and content utilization. The paper considers employing a big data solution for intelligent libraries as part of an ongoing learning process, intending to better the library's functions by merging conventional systems with big data advancements. Besides the afore-mentioned system segments, the model incorporates the infrastructure and integration of a recommendation system for collaborative filtering and includes various differentiable data sources using big data technology. An evaluation of the model was performed, including testing and measuring relevant performance factors that affect the proposed model's efficiency.
