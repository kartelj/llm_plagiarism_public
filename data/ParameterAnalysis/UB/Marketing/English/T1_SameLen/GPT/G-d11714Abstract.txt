This doctoral study targets the methods of enhancing non-repetitive manufacturing system's operational efficiency - principally lead time, and delivery dependability - via lean implementation. Several instances of operational performance augmentation via lean implementation exist primarily in repetitive manufacturing systems where lean was created. Current studies show a palpable interest in using lean in non-repetitive manufacturing systems. But, there are fewer examples of performance improvement in non-repetitive settings compared to repetitive ones. Among the explanations for this is that the comprehension of lean in non-repetitive systems isn't as organized and systemized as in repetitive ones. Furthermore, there's no universal model for lean implementation in non-repetitive manufacturing systems accounting for all the specific manufacturing environment characteristics as well as lean's characteristics. The study's main purpose is to enhance knowledge about lean manufacturing and test lean implementation effects in non-repetitive manufacturing systems by developing an unprecedented and original model. This model, derived from past experience analysis and the trial model validation within a typical non-repetitive manufacturing company, exposes that interest in implementing lean in non-repetitive manufacturing systems exists, but so do challenges brought about by the non-repetitive systems’ specific traits which prevent the direct copy of lean application from repetitive systems. To test lean feasible application in non-repetitive systems, this dissertation uses scientific data to understand lean processing, non-repetitive manufacturing system characteristics, potential challenges of lean implementation in said systems, and problem-solving possibilities through lean application. Lean was birthed at Toyota within a repetitive system, and there are large differences between non-repetitive and repetitive systems caused mostly by the different needs of the two methods, thereby influencing the goals and activities to meet them. These variations can affect the lean implementation within non-repetitive manufacturing systems because lean implementation is largely in sync with repetitive system traits, hence the need for a unique approach to cater to a particular manufacturing environment. An original model for lean implementation aimed at improving non-repetitive manufacturing system operational performance was created based on lean implementation possibilities within non-repetitive systems analysis. Two paths guided the model crafting. The first was to create a framework for lean application in non-repetitive systems, striving to shed new light on lean principles vis-à-vis non-repetitive system characteristics, and evaluate the possible application of lean principles made-to-measure for shaping the non-repetitive manufacturing surroundings. The second, a development from the first, was to formalize the lean application model in non-repetitive systems, operationalizing tailor-made lean principles through steps to boost operational performance. To test the enhancement possibilities of lead time and delivery reliability via lean implementation in non-repetitive systems, the model was applied in a typical non-repetitive manufacturing company. First, simulation tested the possibilities, revealing that model application can enhance lead time and delivery reliability. This led to an empirical validation, realized through the model's actual application at the company. The empirical results revealed an operational performance improvement in non-repetitive systems, particularly in lead time and delivery reliability through lean implementation. The doctoral thesis' contribution is seen through key results: (1) Via designing a new lean implementation model, tailor-made for non-repetitive system characteristics; (2) Evaluating lean application model possibilities for non-repetitive system operational performance boost via simulation and empirical analysis; (3) Model assessment based on evaluation of simulation and empirical research outcomes; (4) A review of lean-related research, particularly lean application in non-repetitive systems; (5) A critical assessment of past lean implementation research in non-repetitive manufacturing; (6) Suggestions for further research.
