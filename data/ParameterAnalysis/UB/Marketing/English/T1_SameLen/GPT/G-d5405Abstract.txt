Several studies in the past two decades reveal that regardless of implementing high-quality models, health care institutions continue to experience errors and non-compliance. Thus, these organizations still offer subpar services. These implemented models vary, even though they follow a common guideline, standard, or concept, resulting in disparate outcomes. The variance in quality model structure and outcomes can be attributed to the translation process of guidelines into usable models for health care quality assurance or enhancement, while overlook non-clinical processes vital for the quality of health care operations and their services. Information about the quality of various health care organizations, physicians, treatment or diagnostic methods needed for patients to choose a specific health care organization, doctor, or treatment is often nonexistent, inadequate, or not formatted to aid decision-making. There is limited information available to patients about the quality or results of different treatments or providers. Healthcare quality reports primarily aid in selecting health plans and enhancing the quality amongst providers and plans but do little for patient awareness and choice. Consequently, superior quality health care organizations do not enjoy an increase in patients choosing their services, and patients lack clear information that lets them make choices based on factors vital to them. This situation highlights two key challenges in achieving quality in health care institutions and reaping the rewards accruing from it. The first batch of challenges arises from converting broad standards, guidelines, and regulations into a specific model for a particular health care organization, often overlooking non-health care processes. The second bunch of problems arises when reporting achieved quality as excess parameters data often makes it difficult for patients to decide on their healthcare organization of choice and complicates comparisons between healthcare organizations. By viewing healthcare organization as a business system via the lens of Anatomical Structure Model developed at Faculty of Organizational Science, each component impacting the quality of health care services and the structure of the organization can be identified. The outcome is a Model for Quality Improvement of Health Care Business Systems, which bridges specific policies, standards, guidelines, or concepts, and a tangible model for quality assurance, regulation, and management of health care organizations. This model includes visual, verbal, and mathematical parts, enabling the computation of the quality of each aspect of the health care business system. It hence enables quality comparisons amongst health care business systems using this model, or their constituent elements of the same nature. The model's application within two primary healthcare business systems demonstrated that the model effectively enhances the quality of health care business systems.
