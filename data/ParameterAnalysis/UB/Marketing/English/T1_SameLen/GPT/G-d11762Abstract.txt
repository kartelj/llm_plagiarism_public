Business intelligence is a crucial foundation for decision-making, integral for an organization's successful operations and management. Its primary features encompass huge data extraction, warehousing, and analysis. Recent studies in Business Intelligence highlight the potential for valuable unstructured data extraction, enabling more precise decision-making across all management levels. A company's ability to set up a ubiquitous setting for all their data extractors and decision junctures is pivotal for the Smart Grid concept's success. Smart Grid technologies are revolutionizing the electrical power industries, impacting all elements of the electricity supply chain, leading to changing market setups and business models. Business intelligence and performance management infrastructures are highly acknowledged as necessary for wide-scale energy systems adopting Smart Grid technologies. A business intelligence model for B2B e-business, elaborated in this thesis for the transmission system and electricity market operator, is uniquely tailored for electricity market activity monitoring through required information and data flows. Constructing a Business intelligence solution, specifically designed for electricity power systems, demands a structured methodology and architecture defining fundamental data warehouse elements. The methodology proposed for designing a business intelligence system in this thesis aimed to investigate Kimball's modeling approach utilization as a cornerstone for new data warehouse object implementation, depending minimally on predetermined objects within the SAP setting. This goal was achieved using a "bottom-up" approach and introducing a modified dimension life-cycle tailored for Accelerated SAP for the Business Warehouse methodology. The introduced methodology was practically applied, resulting in the business intelligence system for electricity market activity monitoring. The suggested solution was evaluated in the state-owned "Elektromreza Srbije." The results suggest that business intelligence solutions can enhance effective market management in data-rich settings and be successfully utilized for reporting in various organization business sectors. Furthermore, comparative analysis outcomes provide suggestions and potential combined methodologies for developing firm business intelligence systems.
