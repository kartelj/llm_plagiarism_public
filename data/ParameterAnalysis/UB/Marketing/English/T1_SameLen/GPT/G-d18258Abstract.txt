The paper's purpose is to increase understanding of quality costing in today's practices and to establish the necessity for a definition of a quality cost model within the context of a process-systemic approach. A study was conducted on 186 businesses, spanning various sectors, and only those acquainted with quality costs were scrutinized. Selection for the research was based on three indicators of the companies' awareness of quality costs. Findings reveal a high degree of recognition of the significance of quality costs, and a surge in the number of businesses controlling these costs. The study pinpoints elements influencing quality cost management systems and explores relationships between the determining variables. Furthermore, requirements of the ISO 9001:2015 standard that have a statistically significant correlation with variables that shape quality cost management were selected based on the companies’ viewpoints on the importance of adhering to these standards. Since the study emphasizes the necessity for a quality cost model within the context of a process-systemic approach, this paper employs the PAF model at the process level to suggest a quality cost model where quality cost elements are weighed against the process outputs. The impact one process has on another’s quality due to its outputs is also considered. The model provides quality cost details at two junctures: present (pre-intervention) and future (post-intervention) for each process. Root cause analysis of nonconformities and the PAF model's premise that preventative and appraisal measures lessen failure costs and total quality costs informs the necessary control or improvement actions. The model views the disparity between total quality costs at the two measured points as the highest potential for quality cost reduction for the monitored process. This value serves as the benchmark for prioritizing processes in terms of their need for the application of the determined control or improvement actions, given the PAF model’s presumption that higher costs indicate lower quality and therefore a higher urgency for such interventions.
