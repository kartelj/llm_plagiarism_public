This doctoral thesis aims to elucidate the significance of specific events nationally and globally. Since antiquity, people have convened for diverse occasions. These types of events were deemed unique and extraordinary experiences. Such gatherings were conducted infrequently, they were distinctive, and transpired due to specific circumstances, individual requests, or group demands of the government system. These occasions created excitement and a distinct impact. Today, the leisure and entertainment industry is a focal point. Over the last several years, it has grown rapidly and now holds a special position in the services market, producing a multitude of innovative service execution strategies. Event planning professional agencies are in high demand around the world, constituting a considerable fraction of business success, profit, and positive customer feedback in the global service sector. Conversely, every manager has to make decisions during their working hours. These decisions are made constantly, not only during routine management tasks but also when planning special events. Decision making isn't an isolated managerial function, but a common factor in all other functions. Managers at all levels are part of various choices, from operational and tactical to strategic decisions. This thesis will illustrate how employing a group decision-making system can enhance the organization of special events.
