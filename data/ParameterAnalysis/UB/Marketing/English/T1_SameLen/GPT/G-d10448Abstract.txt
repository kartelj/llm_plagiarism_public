The comprehensive management of supply chains involves strategizing all related activities, necessitating effective cooperation and coordination with all involved partners. Disruptions can result in the bullwhip effect, which can stem from operational and behavioral causes. While most literature addresses operational causes, behavioral factors, including specific personality traits, are often overlooked but critical. Despite widespread recognition of the importance of collaboration in mitigating the bullwhip effect, no studies have investigated cooperation as a characteristic. This thesis examines the influence of participant cooperation on supply chain expenses via a tailored beer game, demonstrating how to establish a cooperative supply chain. Participant cooperativity was surveyed through a social value orientation questionnaire. The central premise of the thesis was validated - enhancing cooperation among supply chain participants can benefit chain operations and resolve coordination challenges. The investigation of behavioral elements in the supply chain, along with transactional analysis of participant communication and interaction, revealed how to boost participant cooperation within the supply chain. Eventually, effective cooperative behaviors were outlined as supply chain conduct principles and incorporated into a simulation using Petri nets. This validated Petri nets' capacity to include various supply chain influencing factors, even personality traits, hence simulations utilizing Petri nets can substitute real-life experiments.
