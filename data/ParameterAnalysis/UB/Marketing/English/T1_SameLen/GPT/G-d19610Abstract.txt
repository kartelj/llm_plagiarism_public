This doctoral thesis study investigates the growth of customer relationship management (CRM) in the digital endeavor of intelligent libraries. The paper's principal issue is the exploration of the potentiality of integrating the customer relationship management process into an integrated library system (ILS) as a technique to enhance library engagement with patrons and stakeholders. To implement an effective customer relationship management model in intelligent libraries' digital business, ideal for developing nations, the model is assessed based on open-source software in this doctoral thesis. The model comprises an integrated library management system, CRM system, intelligent technologies, mobile services, and social media services. A comprehensive analysis of customer relationship management research data is shown. A model for managing customer relationships is outlined in the focal section of the research paper, including its integration method with the integrated library system. The suggested model illustrates the CRM system's infrastructure and architecture in intelligent libraries' digital business. An experiment was performed in the thesis, intended to explore the application of CRM concepts and intelligent technologies in libraries and librarians' openness to adopt these innovations to enhance customer engagement. Based on the formulated model, a system for managing customer relationships in an intelligent library is realized by integrating CRM systems into an integrated library system. The obtained findings validated the primary hypothesis that the incorporation of CRM systems in intelligent libraries' digital business optimizes library processes, enhances library operation performance, and improves engagement with patrons.
