Integrated financial risk management allows monetary organizations to operate more efficiently, securely, and beneficially in both local and international markets. This management reacts to risks inherent in financial intermediation, with the paper providing a succinct summary of the contemporary activities' role, importance, and impact, emphasizing financial risk models in particular. These organizations, encompassing deposit, non-deposit, intermediary, and service providers, grapple with various risks like credit, interest rate and solvency, liquidity, market, operational, and technological risks. The culmination of these risks can propagate infection horizontally and vertically, leading financial institutions (such as banks) to substantial losses, even bankruptcy. Most financial risks are diverse and intricate, producing disproportionately sizeable losses as they interact with other risks, thus infinitely augmenting their impact. A risk management strategy, alongside information and communication technologies, is essential in identifying all forms of uncertainty, measuring, modifying when needed, and controlling the uncertainty via novel methods, financial derivatives (i.e., forward, futures, options, swaps), securitization, and other tools. Thus, these institutions can undertake ventures that offer suitable returns relative to the risk, ensuring a business-friendly environment for generating and augmenting value for their owners. Regulatory alterations in financial institutions, particularly in banking (Basel II and Basel III), have fostered these changes, tying capital to the projected level of credit among other risks such as market, operational, and liquidity risks.
