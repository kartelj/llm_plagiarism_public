Cyber warfare involves conflict in cyberspace through the use of information communication technologies. It is a distinct type of international conflict, differing in means, methods, and participants from conventional warfare. Cyber warfare can occur independently of war and peace times. Its techniques, methods, and attack processes are not significantly technologically different from criminal, espionage or terrorist activities. This form of conflict is growing with the spread and influence of information technologies at the national and global level. The practice of cyber conflict is real and dynamic at an international scale. Nations are increasingly allocating budget funds for cyber conflict, developing capacities and structures for cyberspace operations, and formulating doctrines and strategies for their application and expansion. Some countries have proclaimed cyberspace the fifth domain of military activities, equal to land, sea, air, and space. Likewise, the international community naturally seeks to regulate all conflicts, including cyber warfare. Applying existing laws of armed conflict and making analogies with appropriate armed conflict situations in physical space is one way to do so. Despite the short period for developing doctrines, methods, and means for cyberspace operations, there is abundant scientific and professional literature offering ways to apply this analogy in regulating cyber warfare. A significant portion of this literature discusses applying laws based on cyber attack outcomes – an approach accepted by a majority of international legal experts, including the authors of the Tallinn Manual for cyber warfare. Despite such theoretical approaches, issues and outcomes of conducting cyber attacks at the international level remain largely unresolved and unregulated. States conduct operations in cyberspace, taking advantage of the difficulty in detecting attacks until their obvious consequences surface. It is often impossible to identify and allocate responsibility for attackers, i.e., to realistically determine a state's accountability for an attack and its repercussions according to the rules, norms, and principles of International law of armed conflict. Given the significance and anticipated growth of cyber conflict and warfare in modern international relations in line with future information technologies developments, and the inability to practically regulate situations through traditional armed conflict law, this dissertation focuses on the international legal regulation of cyberspace conflict. The objective is to understand the nature of cyber warfare and cyberspace conflict to suggest how to regulate it in the future. This objective was attained through the analysis of conflict threats, identification of its dominant qualities, types and content, assessment of the applicability of traditional law to new conflict situations in cyberspace, and the laying of a foundation for future research in this field. Considering the limitations arising from the technological nature of information-communication technologies and cyberspace, as well as the rapid application of such technologies for conflict in cyberspace, the initial hypothesis was that there is no theoretical foundation for long-term prediction and understanding of the nature of cyber warfare and its international legal regulation. Given the fluctuating nature of cyber warfare and conflict and the need for simultaneous and complex analysis of the topic in various scientific fields, such as computer science, law, military science, sociology, military theory, and information security practice, a multidisciplinary and partially interdisciplinary research approach was adopted. In order to provide a scientific explanation of key categories, phenomena, and concepts essential for the research – such as cyberspace, cyber attacks, cyber weapons, cyber warfare and cyberspace conflict – an exhaustive analysis and organization of existing knowledge, practice, and experiences in the fields of cyber conflict and warfare were carried out. The purpose was to synthesize critical concepts for understanding the nature of cyber warfare and its international legal regulation. The research results indicate that cyber warfare is a technologically-dependent conflict that occurs in cyberspace, fundamentally different from all traditional forms of conflict occurring in the physical world. Crucial aspects of cyberspace conflict – including conflict methods, participants, and methods of warfare – fundamentally differ from situations within a traditional armed conflict. A prominent challenge in the international legal regulation of cyber warfare is the regular inability to locate cyber attacks, perform attacker identification and role allocation, and determine state responsibility for attacks. These challenges arise due to the technological nature of cyber warfare and therefore, cannot be efficiently solved with legal regulation alone – they also require the use of suitable technological solutions. In certain areas, such as carrying out cyber attacks with the direct participation of individuals outside of public and private computer information networks, key activities for the application of law cannot be practically realized. The dissertation provides a comprehensive analysis of numerous relevant sources of notions, definitions, and concepts, upon which the main characteristics of cyberspace and conflicts within cyberspace are based. According to the results of the analysis, cyberspace is an environment where data and information are generated, stored, processed, exchanged, and obliterated through the application of computer systems. This environment is characterized by the existence or possibility of creating networks of systems, processes, and people at the data level. The dissertation addresses the challenges of applying traditional International Law of Armed Conflict to conflicts in cyberspace, analyzes key notions, concepts, and phenomena important for warfare in cyberspace between states, and offers a proposal resulting from research findings that relate to future state behavior for the purpose of building cyber defense capabilities against cyberspace attacks and future regulation of cyberspace conflicts. Unlike conventional conflicts in the physical environment, which entail organized application of exclusive and specific weaponry for conflict conduct, cyber warfare is a process – not the use of ‘cyber weapons’ – and represents a deliberate violation of information security of a targeted system in cyberspace for military purposes. Every cyber attack process involves identifying system vulnerabilities, determining their nature, exploiting vulnerabilities for unauthorized system access, and executing the attack. This process primarily depends on computer system technology and information security, not military skill and practice. Despite the absence of a military presence, lack of specific military weaponry use, and the ability to carry out attacks during peace and war times, within or outside a political conflict context, in secret, delayed, and decentralized, cyber attacks have the potential to accomplish substantial military effects and objectives at a tactical, operational, and strategic level. Acknowledging the specific, technologically-based nature of cyber warfare, it should be understood in the broadest context, not solely as a conflict during wartime or a military activity during military operations in the physical world, but as a multitude of potential activities taking place at the physical, logical, and cognitive levels of cyberspace. The logical level of cyberspace, which is based on logical-mathematical rules and instructions, is the foundation of cyberspace, and connects its influence on the living and non-living world in the physical environment through data, computer systems that process them, and the meaning of the information conveyed by that data. Broad application of information-communication technologies in cyberspace for the purpose of conducting conflicts at an international level is a result of the increasing prevalence of these technologies in all aspects of human life and work, including peace time and military environments. This fact, not the extent and substance of cyberspace conflict effects, implies the future development of this type of conflict and warfare, and grants them the capability for fast development and changing of form, use, and repercussions. The purpose of this dissertation is in delineating the nature of cyber conflict and warfare, their sources, and the relations between military, international legal, social, and information security practice. This purpose imparts the practical contribution of the dissertation, as manifested in the conclusions of its research. One of the conclusions is that the application of cyber warfare has a future, primarily dependent on the development of information communication technologies, not international community's ability to traditionally and legally regulate cyberspace conflicts. Other conclusions pertain to ways of building national cyber warfare capacity, as well as the only feasible direction for practical regulation of cyber conflict at the international level. The dissertation emphasizes that the foundation for building a national cyber defense system is not in owning and applying technical systems for conducting operations in cyberspace, but in managing specific knowledge in the field of applied information security in cyberspace at the national level. The dissertation also finds that international legal regulation of cyber warfare is not feasible through exclusive application of traditional International Law of Armed Conflict, or even through creating new legal systems, if they are based solely on traditional legal solutions without incorporating and applying technological solutions at the basic level of modern information communication technologies. The conclusion of the analysis is that the development of new technologies will swiftly trigger the development of new cyber warfare capabilities. The dissertation proposes that the only means of practically regulating cyber warfare at the international level, while limiting its adverse effects, is via possible bilateral and multilateral cooperation of stakeholders in the international community. Conflicts in cyberspace do not only occur during a state of war, and not only through the application of military offensive operations, so the solution for their regulation cannot be found solely in International Law of Armed Conflict. It should be part of a comprehensive approach that includes various possibilities and activities of military and non-military exercise of national power. The solution for limiting cyber conflicts lies in the combined application of diplomatic, political, economic, military, legal, information, and other efforts and activities.
