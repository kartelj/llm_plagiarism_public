The successful transition of Central and Eastern Europe, including Serbia, hinges on the privatization of government and collectively owned businesses. It's been demonstrated that restructuring is crucial before these businesses can be privatized. Therefore, various restructuring strategies are employed to enhance firms' output, efficiency and shareholder value. This thesis examines a restructuring method predicated on essential value drivers. It presents the concept of value, how to measure value creation, and value creation models. The goal is for management to grasp the process of creating value through restructuring decisions related to operations, investment, and financing. Therefore, creating value necessitates the pursuit of strategies that elevate the return on invested capital, diminish risk or incorporate both. Value creation, the disparity between the equity value before and after restructuring, measures the success of the restructuring. A company's equity value equals the present worth of its future cash flows, and it depends both on future cash flows and the average cost of capital. Consequently, to raise equity value, businesses must increase cash flows by boosting revenue, reducing costs, and enhancing asset turnover. They should also decrease operating risk and therefore capital costs. The right sale method can increase the success of equity sales for companies undergoing restructuring. This paper examines the role of public tenders and auctions in selling the equity of government and collective enterprises undergoing restructuring and privatization. This thesis affirms the hypothesis that restructuring improves company value and readies them for sale to investors through the research and analysis provided. Additionally, it proves that a feasible restructuring model reliant on key value drivers can be applied in any company based on the methodology presented. Lastly, from an examination of Serbia's privatization results, this paper demonstrates that the model of selling government and collective enterprises is the most effective privatization method during the latter stages of transition.
