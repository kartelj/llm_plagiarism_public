Advancements in modern information and communication technologies have broadened teaching and learning possibilities through the use of innovative methods and aids, enhancing the quality of online education. Additionally, intelligent learning spaces and the Internet of Things have transformed educational techniques in both conventional and virtual community settings. New ideas related to collective intelligence and cooperative learning remain somewhat unformed in theoretical and methodological terms within the realm of online education and smart learning environments. Within these concepts is crowdsourcing, which leverages the expertise of a group to complete a task. Crowdsourcing has emerged as a successful innovation in education, research, and problem-solving. The central hypothesis examined and supported in this thesis proposed that the creation and utilization of crowdsourcing models within smart learning environments boosts education performance and quality, enhances student drive, and betters the output of the education process. In the practical aspect of this doctoral thesis, three studies were conducted in two higher education institutes to validate the suggested crowdsourcing models in numerous academic settings. The assessment's outcomes validated the significant potential of the proposed models, demonstrated students' eagerness to cooperate, their problem-solving aptitude, and their ability to produce high-quality solutions, along with a strong level of self-organization.
