The inception of innovative products and services re-energizes existing sectors while creating entirely new ones, hence the importance of technological development and commercialization for the world economy. Hence, entrepreneurship is acknowledged as a catalyst for economic and social development, through the creation of innovative businesses, concepts, products, and services. Social entrepreneurship has increasingly become a focal point for academics and practitioners in recent years, due to its impact on job creation, a vibrant economy, and societal health. Technological entrepreneurship begins with evaluating market potential for technological innovations and aligns them with current or emerging market needs, ultimately aiming to turn potential markets into profit-making goods, services or new businesses. Key to this process are individuals who assemble into teams to create innovative technological ventures known as "technological startups" or simply "startups", categorized as a provisional organization formed to identify a feasible and scalable business model. Startups also describe an early-stage business venture developed in the realms of innovation and cutting-edge technology, characterized by vigorous dynamism, growth, profit, and the generation of new market value. Many startup entrepreneurs with vast technological knowledge produce technologically advanced products and services, often neglecting the business aspect, which typically contributes to startup failure. This dissertation investigates the role of marketing and business orientation in developing technological ventures. The ultimate aim is to develop a comprehensive model highlighting the influence of marketing orientation on startup success during the initial development phase. The notion of marketing orientation is interpreted as an organization's culture that efficiently guides internal behavior and simultaneously provides superior value to customers, thereby establishing a successful business. The influence of marketing orientation on startup developments is examined through competition and customer orientation, and inter-departmental coordination. Further analysis covers entrepreneurial marketing, explored through the elements of entrepreneurial orientation such as innovation, proactiveness, risk-taking, autonomy, and competitive aggression. Additionally, the analysis within the dissertation encompasses environmental impact, competitiveness levels, and the mentorship role in startup development. It also studied the traits of successful entrepreneurs. As startups are not like established companies, measuring their performance presents a novel challenge to both academic and practical circles. Drawing from pre-existing scholarly literature and qualitative research conducted among specific target audiences, thirteen developmental goals for technological startups have been identified. Subsequent quantitative research condenses these goals into four success factors: Idea and concept success, value proposition success, value exchange success, and business model success. The results from this quantitative research underscore the significance of specific factors related to marketing and entrepreneurial orientations in successful startup development. It also highlights the effects of environmental competitiveness and mentorship. Lastly, attributes of successful technological startup founders have been identified as part of the research.
