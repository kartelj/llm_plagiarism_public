The dissertation's focus is exploring the potential development of a flexible, adaptable process performance measurement model. As modern organizational management is about managing processes, successful processes are crucial for achieving the organization’s objectives. Key performance indicators measure process success. The research partially examines the interdependencies of high-level organizational goals and process performance indicators in companies applying a process approach. The study into enhancing the system adaptability and flexibility includes analysing extant performance measurement models, describing them, and creating a new, more adaptable model. The development involves defining the model (structure elements, connections and interdependencies), applying it, and polishing it based on outcomes. The thesis posits and demonstrates that the formalization of interdependencies between top organizational goals and key process performance indicators fosters the improvement of business performance measurement systems’ flexibility and adaptability. After extensive literature review, the paper provides a scientific description and comparative analysis of current process performance measurement models. A new GPI (Goal; Process; Indicator) model is then introduced which allows direct identification of interdependencies between high-level goals and process performance indicators, offering some flexibility and adaptability. A case study is subsequently carried out. Based on these findings, the preliminary model is refined. The research results and proposed GPI model furnish the groundwork for improved, simpler performance management and further research in this field.
