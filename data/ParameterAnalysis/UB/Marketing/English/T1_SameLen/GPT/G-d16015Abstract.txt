'As Serbia approaches integration with the European Union, significant changes in health and social systems are anticipated. The remodelled system will most likely rely less on state-funded healthcare due to financial and organisational challenges, thus creating space for private health institutions to play a significant role. Currently, despite a substantial number of such institutions already operating in Serbia, the sector is still evolving, with dynamic growth anticipated in the future. The successful development of private healthcare will hinge largely on the proper organization of marketing and sales processes, and accurate forecasting of competitive challenges. Defining a development model that highlights the interrelationship between sales and marketing activities, and their impact on brand growth and positioning, will be a priority management task. This article aims to provide basic recommendations guided by previous experiences and research projects.'
