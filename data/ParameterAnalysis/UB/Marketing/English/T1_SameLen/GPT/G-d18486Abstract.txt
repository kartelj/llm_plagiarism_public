The PhD thesis "Designing marketing communication strategies for child-focused cultural-educational institutions" offers a systematic collation of theoretical knowledge drawn from prior research on marketing communication strategies in the realm of cultural and child-focused educational establishments. It also includes practical insights gleaned from several years working in a Belgrade city-appointed children's cultural establishment and from numerous children and youth cultural projects. This research aims to equate the treatment of child-centered cultural-educational establishments with that of other cultural institutions aimed at an older demographic, given the absence of comprehensive literature addressing this issue. The problem the dissertation addresses is the market mindset obliviousness in children's cultural institutions, which directly jeopardises institutional survival and future evolution. The research utilised interviews, surveys, focus groups, and case studies; moreover, it examined private and public child-focused institutions and organizations in Serbia and its region, in comparison to similar establishments outside the region. The paper scrutinises the challenges in implementing marketing communication tactics and public relations, and demonstrates how children's institutions plan and execute these strategies. Best practice examples are provided for a holistic comparison. The paper probes the peculiarities of marketing communication in the cultural and educational sphere, and the relationship between non-profit marketing and public relations, which must coexist in non-profit cultural-educational enterprises. It argues that children's cultural institutions need to secure a competitive stand, maintain their existing consumers, and attract a potential audience, but also awaken the cultural aspiration within the so-called nonexistent audience. A major hurdle to the progress of cultural-educational establishments is an insufficient audience. By deploying integrated marketing communications and public relations, children's cultural and educational institutions can collectively, alongside schools, foster children's cultural interests, shape cultural habits and contribute to healthier adulthoods. Theoretical and empirical studies substantiate the paper's primary hypothesis that the triumphant market positioning of children's cultural and educational establishments requires constant application of marketing communication strategies. It is concluded that marketing is instrumental in the culture and education industry, in its widest sense. While substantial distinctions exist between the for-profit and non-profit sectors, basic marketing principles such as meeting customer needs and facilitating mutually beneficial exchanges can be applied to both sectors.
