Fundamentally, the doctoral paper apart from the introduction and overall conclusions with future research suggestions, encircles three distinct yet closely connected and intertwined sections each providing its own conclusion. The primary part (chapters 2-5) comprises definitions of quality signs, human capital, and social capital, and an analysis of their relationships. The conceptualization of human capital embodies the value of our human capacities. Despite numerous attempts to standardize human capital classification, no single model was successful in gaining universal consensus for all required measurements and computations. This issue influences major fields, including science. It has become clear today that without the incorporation of social capital, evaluating human capital seems meaningless as their overlap is unavoidable. While human capital involves knowledge, skills, intellect, etc within an individual, social capital is less tangible, rooted in individual relationships. It might be viewed as the single capital growing only with sharing, originating from family, friendship, professional, and other connections. Finally, quality indicators are qualitative and/or quantitative inputs about a studied phenomenon, allowing for analysis of its evolution, monitoring targets, making decisions, and providing directions alongside pinpointing areas requiring further investigation. To connect quality indicators with success factors, their base must always be the needs and expectations of primary stakeholders. The second part aims to clarify and introduce concepts with potential to shape the future of human and social capital management. It challenges traditional views on management issues by letting theories from different areas (virtual, technical, history, nature) migrate into the sphere of social complexity, providing new paradigms. This model adds to sustainable development and potentially aligns employee behavior strategically. New solutions for different governance and management systems are provided throughout this part, showing how policymakers can use this paradigm shift for stronger stakeholder involvement. This process lays out conditions for the emergence of quality indicators for human and social capital in the science community. The final part begins with the development of the quality indicators model for the research. To succeed, entirely new data sources were required, as using new indicators with dated data formats would not result in breakthroughs. This necessitated a shift from aggregated, macro statistics to smaller-scale details, fitting the conditions of the science community. The research method involved data collection from Serbian-origin scientists both in Homeland and Diaspora, followed by CV analysis and further data search in all public sources. The research covered 444 PhDs (202 in Homeland and 242 in Diaspora), allowing for the confirmation of the three hypotheses. The most significant findings include that Diaspora Serbian PhDs, compared to Homeland ones, published more papers, were cited more, have a higher overall IF, ResearchGate score, and h-index value, coauthor more, and have a wider perspective of work in science and research. Homeland scientific community members, however, show a higher devotion to the wider community's interests they identify with, including tradition and heritage-respecting. Serbian PhDs globally also believe that people's consciousness rapidly evolves due to science and technology's impact. Homeland PhDs view "succession planning" as a work factor, are more open to leveraging their ancestor's experiences in critical decision-making and express more fear of civilization trends potentially leading to global disaster.
