This study aims to highlight the significance of the behavioral method in decision-making processes within current finance. Behavioral finance is an emerging scientific field examining the impact of emotional, cognitive, and social factors on financial decision-making processes. It's an interdisciplinary exploration grounded in psychology and used in the realm of modern finance. The goal is to underscore the required practical implementation of behavioral finance, which, backed by psychology, elucidates how decision-makers reach their decisions. It also scrutinizes behavior in business decision-making, bridging the gap between traditional finance and reality, as well as the methods financial participants utilize in decision-making, considering all personal emotions and human restrictions. The behavioral theory does not disregard emotions in human behavior or overlook the potent influence of emotions in the decision-making processes within modern finance. Behavioral finance allows for a superior comprehension of investors' behavior, managers, and occurrences in the complex and uncertain business environment occurring on financial markets. A survey and three focused group interviews with financial managers were conducted to discern whether and to what extent the concepts of behavioral finance are present in Serbia and Montenegro. The focus groups' aims were to construct a value orientation scale for financial managers utilized later in the survey to comprehend how prevalent the concepts of behavioral finance are in our financial institutions' practice. Three groups discussed manager performances, decision-making, value systems, and behavioral finance, with twenty-three managers from Montenegro participating. From these moderated discussions, a seven-point grading scale for manager value orientations was developed, featuring 15 values dependent on two aspects: result-oriented values and moral values. The survey research was conducted to ascertain what decision-making styles financial managers predominantly employ and to examine the role of emotional competence and value orientations in forming decision styles. Based on the results gained from research and focus groups, it can be concluded that managers lack sufficient awareness of behavioral finance theory concepts, and these theories' insights are not utilized in practice. Despite consensus on the significance of personality traits for success in this field, professional employment selection is rarely in place. And when it does occur, these traits are not verified. The findings indicate that managers typically rely on the rational decision-making style, contradicting the behavioral finance theory's claim that humans are not always rational in decision-making. Bear in mind, in our environment, emotions are deemed unnecessary, and rational thinking is advised - a notion discarded long ago in economically developed countries. However, this research's outcomes show that the formation of rational, intuitive, and evading decision-making styles depends on emotional competence and values. This partially verifies the behavioral finance theory that states that decision-making is influenced not only by information but also by personality traits, value systems, previous experience, emotions, attitudes, motivation, among other factors.
