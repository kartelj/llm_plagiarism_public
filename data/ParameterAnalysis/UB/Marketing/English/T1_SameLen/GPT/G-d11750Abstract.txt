However, as business system operations and performance progressively become more complex and hence the accountability for decisions made grows even greater, it becomes necessary to consider all diverse thoughts and perspectives held by team members, specifically the amount of prepared knowledge, all for the purpose of group decision making. Furthermore, it is a mathematically validated truth that the total knowledge of all team members by definition always surpasses the knowledge of any individual team member. The sole requirement here is existing communication and resource sharing among team members. Conversely, the call for enhancement in group decision making quality is apparent. This poses an enduring research topic for individuals with significant practical and theoretical understanding.
