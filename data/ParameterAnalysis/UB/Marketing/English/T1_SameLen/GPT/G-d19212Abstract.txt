The focus of this thesis is on remote sensing methodology, exploring methods of collecting, preparing, and processing data, with a specific emphasis on classification through statistical methods to identify given phenomena. The research primarily centers around a proposal for a methodology that determines the sensitivity zone, a key feature in phenomena classification using multivariate analysis statistical methods. Remote sensing, a non-contact technique of collecting information about objects (usually Earth's surface), is extensively explored throughout this work. This interdisciplinary field employs electromagnetic radiation, acoustics, and other forms of emitted or reflected energy that is later processed, analyzed, and utilized. Peaking within the realms of geospatial science and technology, remote sensing often converges with image processing disciplines and GIS, also forming a significant part of this dissertation.

Pixels, the smallest single image units which possess unique attributes of brightness and color spectrum, are crucial statistical sample entities representative of the whole image. The key aspect of this work is the classification of remotely-sensed data to categorize parts or pixels. This assignment to various classes employs multiple data sets and is governed by the pixels' statistical features regarding color intensity.

The term multivariate analysis elaborates the multi-faceted nature of data analysis, dealing with variables representing the numerous describable phenomena, significant in remote sensing which typically represent each pixel in three or multiple light spectrum bandwidths. The thesis also dedicates attention to data clustering techniques and Bayesian decision theory, with the Discriminant Analysis at the heart of the proposed method; it bases its approach on statistically quantifiable decision-making compromises. This process primarily involves dividing observations into pre-established groups, focusing on classifying them according to several variables' values in distinct groups.

The thesis reviews remote sensing classification techniques, from digital image theory to image processing techniques. It divides the classification methods into two categories - Supervised and Unsupervised. In Supervised classification, representative parts of the image serve as training sets, with spectral properties guiding the algorithm to recognize spectrally matching areas in each class. On the other hand, Unsupervised classification clusters spectral classes utilizing numerical data, following which the analyst validates and maps them into information classes. Accuracy evaluation of the resulting maps is crucial, derived by contrasting against reference data.

Despite the classification method, discerning accuracy level is key, and this is extensively elaborated on through a spotlight on classification accuracy measuring techniques. Emphasizing the sensitivity zone, the research seeks to enhance overall classification accuracy and economize on time and resources. Chapter six delves deeper into the issue of classification, addressing the sensitivity zone, overlap levels, and proposing a novel technique to define and utilize sensitivity zones in remote sensing. The strategy here is to reduce misclassification probabilities and identify borderline elements between two categories to increase classification accuracy.

The thesis outlines the sensitivity zone determination methodology, highlighting its advantages over other remote sensing data classification methods. These advantages manifest as improvements in classification accuracy and reduced time and computing resource consumption. A two-phase classification strategy is undertaken: a very rapid discrimination (hyper) plane determination is performed using discriminant analysis, identification of entities in the sensitivity zone, and a computationally complex classification using the k-nearest neighbors method.

Chapter seven showcases case studies and sensitivity zone application possibilities in precision agriculture remote sensing. Methods testing occurs on several types of crops, with results comparison to widely-used classification methods. The research significantly contributes to data analysis, especially for unmanned aircraft collected imagery in agriculture for seasonal and perennial crops. An addressal of set objectives concludes the work, along with a brief overview of the software solution developed for the research and data analysis purpose.
