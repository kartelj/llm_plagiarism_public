This research seeks to identify, scrutinize, and ascertain various forms of real options, further examining their impact on the creation of shareholder value. Predicated upon the findings, the objective is to suggest a novel valuation method for equity associated with corporations characterized by high risk and high flexibility. This study offers a comprehensive view of modern strategy concepts and connects them to the creation of shareholder value. A company has several real options available when implementing a specific strategy. From a review of pertinent literature, indicators of flexibility and uncertainty were identified, implying a potential prevalence of real options. These indicators assisted in categorizing corporations and determining which possessed valuable real options. Additionally, financial performance indicators for companies marked by high flexibility and high uncertainty were determined and their attributes presented. This dissertation pinpoints and critically discusses prevailing stock pricing models. Given the entirety of the findings, excess return is associated with risk, real options, and general strategies. Panel data analysis is utilized in this study. Various definitions of growth options were employed to examine the sensitivity of the suggested method. Furthermore, predicted and actual excess return results were compared to validate this method. Indicators of real options have significance in elucidating the risk-return relationship, but it is evident that the market is more cautious when appraising these options. The cost-leadership strategy enhances investors' excess return.
