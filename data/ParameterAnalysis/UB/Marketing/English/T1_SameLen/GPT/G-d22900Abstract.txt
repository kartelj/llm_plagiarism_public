Negotiations, which are intricate and ever-changing social procedures, aim to find a solution that satisfies all involved parties' objectives. Establishing a concentrated and complex communication system entails understanding the required information, its significance, communication routes, regularity of communication, and effectiveness. The necessity for effective negotiation information and an awareness of events influencing value addition verifies communication needs. This paper investigates and analyzes how marketing communication affects business negotiation and value addition. The doctoral thesis centers on exploring the interplay and relationships between marketing communication tools and business negotiation stages for generating extra value. Viewing business negotiation as a corporate philosophy, where marketing communication is crucial, allows the firm to reap numerous benefits or create added value components. By probing into the target market, it fosters the evaluation of marketing communications' impact and hence their influence on business negotiations. In this scenario, empirical research was conducted to examine the contribution of individual communication channels and negotiation stages, while linear regression analyses were conducted on the complete sample, separated into buyers and sellers.
