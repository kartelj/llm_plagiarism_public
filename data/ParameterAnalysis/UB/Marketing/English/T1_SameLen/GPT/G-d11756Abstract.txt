The construction sector is vast and intricate, with contractors undertaking a large proportion of construction tasks. Consequently, project success is largely dependent on their skills and credentials. Thus, picking a suitable contractor involves a critical choice at each project's heart. An effective approach involves a prequalification process to assess their suitability before reaching the bid awarding phase where the final selection decision occurs. As this issue mirrors a typical multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) problem, we employed the AHP method. This thesis' purpose is to propose a model to aid the Libyan Central Committee of Tendering (henceforth: Committee) in prequalifying prospective contractor candidates. The model was tested on four Serbian construction firms and comprises four criteria: experience, technical prowess, managerial competence, and human capability. A sensitivity analysis was performed to ascertain the model's robustness.  
We deduced that the suggested model can provide a trustworthy platform for the Libyan Central Committee of Tendering in prioritizing such decision-making.  Furthermore, the proposed model appears efficient, producing satisfactory results and succeeding in informing rational choices during the contractor prequalification process, undoubtedly improving the integrity and transparency of the country's bid awarding procedures.
