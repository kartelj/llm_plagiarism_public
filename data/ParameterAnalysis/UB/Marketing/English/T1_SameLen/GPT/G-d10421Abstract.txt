Current organizations exhibit increasing interest in intellectual capital management, which comprises human capital, structural and relational capital. Intellectual capital spans beyond organizational knowledge to include staff competencies, organizational structure, business processes, intellectual property, and corporate culture. Both internal and external resources, including relationships with customers, suppliers, distributors, and stakeholders, are essential. Intellectual capital encompasses elements not reflected in financial statements but are crucial for creating organizational value. Proper application of intellectual capital augments an organization's value, with a heightened emphasis on qualitative rather than quantitative aspects. Intellectual capital serves as a strategic guide for future organizational changes. This thesis seeks to investigate how organizations identify, evaluate, and report intellectual capital. It reviews relevant literature concerning intellectual capital and past studies on intellectual capital management practices. Its empirical research addresses the perception of intellectual capital in Serbian organizations and analyzes its importance for financial reporting. The study validates the hypothesis that properly managing intellectual capital plays a leading role in modern performances to obtain holistic information. The final recommendation involves assessing intellectual capital and revealing it in supplementary financial statements, providing a more accurate representation of the organization’s value.
