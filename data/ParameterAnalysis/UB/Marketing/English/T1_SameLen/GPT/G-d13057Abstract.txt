The aim of his doctoral thesis's research is to formulate the concept of integrated advertising, implemented by enhancing performance and producing positive outcomes for both advertisers and the target audience. The dissertation determines the effects of employing various advertising tools and the potential to integrate them to convey a cohesive message that stimulates the audience's positive cognitive and emotional responses. An empirical study was conducted in December 2015 at the Faculty of Organizational Sciences, utilizing a sample of 322 second-year students. The investigation proceeded in two subsequent stages. The initial phase involved three experiments executed under monitored laboratory conditions, exposing respondents to specific audio-visual materials purposed for these experiments, featuring indirect, direct, and integrated advertisements. During the second phase, participants completed paper-based questionnaires measuring their cognitive and emotional responses. To evaluate cognitive components, unaided recall, aided recall, and recognition tests were employed, while emotional responses were assessed via evaluations of attitudes towards varying types of advertising and advertised products. Empirical research results showed that among all three advertisement types (indirect, direct, and integrated), integrated advertising held the most potential for brand positioning strategy within the audience's minds. Favorable results (albeit slightly inferior to those of integrated advertising) were noted for direct advertising, attributed to the participants' focus on the experimental content, not reflective of actual conditions. Without specific cues, audiences demonstrated poor recall of brands advertised indirectly, suggesting this advertising strategy's ineffectiveness. However, participants showed a positive inclination towards indirect advertising, making it a viable means to overcome audience resistance potentially caused by exposure to multiple environmental marketing stimuli. This study's findings underline the necessity to primarily plan advertising in an integrated manner, with synergistic messages. Considering these findings in the context of integrated advertising planning, indirect advertising may take precedence over direct advertising, factoring in numerous other goals beyond motivating purchases. The positioning in the audience's minds and the implied resonant effect could provide a stronger incentive for long-term investments in marketing and corporate communication instruments integration.
