The topic of this doctoral thesis is the continued refinement of the method for creating and assessing composite indicators, a product of experts from the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the Joint Research Center (JRC). Composite indicators are standards that are generated when individual indicators, each gauging different facets of the analysed multifaceted concept, are weighted and combined. Increasingly, decision makers use composite indicators to rank and appraise entities on various subjects. The OECD-JRC method offers valuable guidance for the complicated task of building the methodological structure of the composite indicator. Nevertheless, the weighting approach, and the robustness and sensitivity analysis, are aspects of the method that continue to draw focus. This doctoral thesis proposes a weighting method that aims to identify the weighting plan which optimizes the stability of the metric, as measured by the cumulative standard deviations of the relative contributions of indicators. The bootstrap IvanoviÄ‡ distance (I-distance) is proposed to specify the model constraints, while the enhanced Scatter Search (eSS) metaheuristics is used to resolve the outlined optimization problem. This new method factors in the stability of the composite indicator during the process of determining the weighting plan and suggests a data-driven weighting plan that reduces intuitivity levels and compensates for the fact that robustness analysis often isn't undergone during the creation and assessment of composite indicators. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed weighting method can be effectively employed in the process of building and assessing composite indicators.
