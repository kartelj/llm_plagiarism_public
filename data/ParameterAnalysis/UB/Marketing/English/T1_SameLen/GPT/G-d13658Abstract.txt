The mining industry constantly requires innovative solutions for improved, reliable, and safer means of production through all phases, from planning to cessation. The integration of research, science, education, equipment, technology, and organizational and standardization strategies becomes crucial. Mining results aren't solely reliant on natural circumstances, workforce proficiency, equipment, or socio-economic ambiance, but heavily on effective supervision and management â€“ mining administration essentially. This understanding informed the topic and direction of the doctoral thesis presented herein, examining the implications of international standards in Serbia's mining industry. The study seeks to assess worldwide and local advancements in management systems and international standards, and their adaptability in the diversified mining industry. Initial research confirmed the hypothesis that international standards don't suffice for efficient mining administration. Consequently, a structural model integrating international standards, catering to mining management needs for safety, production, exploitation, and environmental safety has been proposed. Pertinently, the thesis tackles significant current issues, offering both theoretical and practical benefits to the mining sector and demonstrating significant outcomes in both areas.
