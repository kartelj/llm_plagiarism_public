Badges for open education are a compelling technology for acknowledging a person or group's attainments, abilities, attributes, and passions. Recently, there's been an expanding range of software applications built on the Open Badges Infrastructure (OBI) that facilitate varied modes of teaching, learning, and awarding badges. Nevertheless, their practicality in specific educational contexts may greatly differ, posing significant challenges for educators when picking such system for an explicit educational use. The purpose of this study is to present potential usability metrics - universal and technology-focused for OBI-compliant systems that can be effectively employed in choosing this form of instructional technology. The primary result of the inquiry is a methodological framework encompassing standard general usability metrics (i.e. gauge of perceived usability based on System Usability Scale) and the technology-oriented usability metrics crafted within the investigation (i.e. gauge of 'ease of sharing badges', 'support for badge creation satisfaction', etc.). The suggested methodology was trialed in an empiric investigation using a mixed research model. The study's findings offered proof of the efficiency of the suggested approach in the mentioned scope. It demonstrated that the recommended metric categories are harmonious and that the metrics have adequately discriminated the appraised systems. Furthermore, qualitative evaluation outcomes uncovered the main usability issues of the audited systems. The method can be implemented in diverse educational environments, as the suggested metrics are relatively straightforward to gather and construe.
