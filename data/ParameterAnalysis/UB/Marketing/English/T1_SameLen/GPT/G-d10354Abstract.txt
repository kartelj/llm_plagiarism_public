Increasingly, firms are expanding their operations to the global market. The rise of globalization and international business has broadened the internationalization of human resource management. In contemporary times, the crucial role of effective human resource management in the success of multinational firms is universally acknowledged. This doctoral thesis examines the challenges confronted by multinational corporations in navigating diverse human resources in an international setting. It outlines and interprets fundamental aspects of international human resource management and its primary activities, chiefly staffing and performance management. As they conduct business in diverse nations, multinational corporations encounter a variety of obstacles. One pivotal choice these firms need to make involves the standardization of human resource management activities. Oftentimes, multinational corporations need to adapt their human resource management policies, practices, and procedures to the specific foreign environments in which they operate. The objective of this doctoral dissertation is to expose how multinational companies carry out staffing and performance management and the degree to which they aim to standardize their human resource management policies and practices at the head office and various worldwide branches - in other words, the degree to which they are successful in implementing those policies and practices from the head office to foreign branches. The dissertation encompasses a literature review on international human resource management and the results of a study focusing on the standardization of human resource management practices in multinational companies. The dissertation involves empirical research undertaken in foreign multinational corporationsâ€™ subsidiaries in Serbia to ascertain the extent of standardization of their human resource management policies and practices, and the elements that heavily impact the potential transfer of these policies and practices from the head office to foreign subsidiaries. The analysis of data gathered via survey in Serbian subsidiaries of multinational corporations shows that they mostly standardize their human resource management policies and practices, including performance management, but not staffing practices. A fresh approach to human resource management, aimed at assisting multinational corporations in making optimal decisions regarding the degree of synchronization of their human resource management policies and practices with those at the head office or adaptation to Serbian local practices, has been suggested based on the research findings.
