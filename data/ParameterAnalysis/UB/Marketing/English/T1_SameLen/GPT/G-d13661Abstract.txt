In an era of drastic transitions, the pharmaceutical field is now, more than ever, globally subjected to uncertainties and frequently misapplied strategies. As we enter a new millennium, social, political, and economic landscapes face fresh trials and tribulations. The journey from traditional medicine manufacturing to today's contemporary pharmaceutical industry witnessed significant events throughout the 20th century, including the rise of major pharmaceutical firms in the 1950s, the thalidomide catastrophe in the 1960s, innovative managerial tactics from the 1970s, the 1990s' capital concentration and international integration, and the explosion of biotechnology at the start of the 21st century. The energetic forces in the previous three decades are spearheading the pharmaceutical industry's advancement, ruling out the possibility of sluggishness and inertia. Considering the global industry's development dynamics and the context within which the pharmaceutical sector operates in Serbia, the focus of this research is the strategic changes management in the pharmaceutical sector, particularly in Serbia. The object of this document includes scrutinizing the pharmaceutical sector, its operations, shifts within the industry, and forming an appropriate framework for managing the industry's strategic changes in Serbia. The paper clarifies the idea of strategic changes and covers all critical models of managing such changes. Particularly, Kotter’s change model, being highly influential, is discussed. Parallelly, we explore the fundamental attributes and fragments of the healthcare and the pharmaceutical sector, globally and in Serbia. Awareness of the industry’s products, marketing strategies, finances and costs, and other key functions are critical. Additionally, significant emphasis is given to the worldwide industry's trends and challenges, which undeniably affect the pharmaceutical industry’s evolution and direction in Serbia. The study delves into Serbia's unique Healthcare and pharmaceutical market. The country's European integration implies notable transformations in this strategic sector. We further evaluate the potential expansion and innovation of this industry within Serbia. An empirical research and demonstration of the need for an organized methodology in the industry's change management in Serbia is further incorporated in this thesis. Based on the findings, a model for managing the strategic modifications has been initiated for Serbia’s pharmaceutical industry which hopefully, will enhance performance, as well as, boost the national health sector’s overall productivity.
