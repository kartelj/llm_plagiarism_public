Conventionally, it was accepted that the purpose of business entities globally was profit generation. However, this assumption has been challenged over recent years as various highly profitable firms have gone bankrupt. This raises the question: "What do organizations need to be viable?" Studies exploring this subject in the past have proposed several frameworks that could support a sustainable business strategy. The goal of this thesis was to establish a novel model for organizational sustainability, using multi-criteria decision-making models to aid strategic decision-making. The investigation was executed in multiple stages. The initial stage involved a literature review for data on indicators pertinent to strategic decision-making. The subsequent phase was studying the indicators featured in sustainability Annual reports of the top-rated global companies. Selecting 150 indicators, categorized in strategic perspectives based on the Balanced Scorecard model, the study was conducted involving strategic decision-makers. The collected results were scrutinized using PCA and Varimax rotation to ascertain correlations and possible groupings among the tested indicators. It was found that there are eight perspectives that represent 69.38% of the total sample. From the findings, the indicators that most accurately represent these perspectives were selected. In the following stage, the fuzzy DEMATEL methodology was employed to calculate the cause-effect relationships between these chosen indicators. The findings show that an organization's sustainable strategy execution depends on eight perspectives with learning perspective, exemplified by the Organizational Knowledge Exchange indicator, being the most influential. The Leadership perspective is the second in significance, followed by sustainability, process, socially responsible operations, market/growth, customers, and finally, finances. The utilization of the developed model should enhance an organization's sustainability prospects in the future.
