The doctoral thesis titled "Brand Management Model for the Establishment of Long-term Customer Relationships" outlines relevant methods that businesses incorporate to successfully manage their brands and customer portfolios. It also explores the potential use of brand management integration with long-term customer relationship management. The thesis begins with an introductory overview of each specific chapter. Chapter Two presents terminology and history associated with brands, as well as a deep dive into brand architecture and knowledge. This section further discusses the process of brand management, emphasizing on the Brand Resonance Model, and explicating terminologies related to brand value, added value, and brand financial value. The next chapter focuses on relationship management, defining its crucial role and discussing the CRM data base and the Payne model of customer relationship management. Chapter Three also critically examines Customer Relationship Management models, segmentation, sub-segmentation and categorisation within CRM. Chapter Four zeroes in on the relationship management between companies and their customers, detailing the models that illustrate these relationships.  Chapter Five elaborates a specific brand management model aimed at building lasting customer relationships, with special attention to the branding model based on customer perspective and the brand and customer relationship model developed by Suzanne Fernie. Terms such as loyalty and customer satisfaction are discussed in this chapter. In Chapter Six, points of convergence between the brand management model and long-term customer relationship management are identified in detail. It also dissects both concepts and specifically hones in on segmentation process and customer categorisation, introducing the term "relationship branding". Lastly, an integral model is presented at the end of the chapter, along with research findings, hypothesis testing, and final observations concerning the thesis's value to the scientific community and its potential implications for managers. Further potential areas of research are proposed. Citations and significant contributions from the thesis are documented in the closing section of the paper.
