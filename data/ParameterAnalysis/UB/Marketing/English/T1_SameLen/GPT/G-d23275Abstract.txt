The PhD thesis explores crafting a national environmental management model through incorporating risk evaluation methods, facilitating legislative, strategic and policy decision-making at a national level, and enhancing mitigation of environmental risks nationally. The model champions a comprehensive approach to environmental risk evaluation, considering often-overlooked risk elements such as societal perception of environmental risks and varying environmental risk inclinations of individuals, organizations, and other societal groups. The national environmental management model, integrating risk evaluation methods, outlined in this dissertation utilizes a hybrid methodology, leveraging both qualitative and quantitative risk evaluation methodologies to prioritize diverse environmental and ecological risks, consequently aiding goal selection in environmental management. The model's application aims at identifying pivotal environmental management sectors at a national level and guiding the stipulation of strategic priorities for addressing environmental challenges and conserving the environment. The model's utilization yields benefits, manifesting in improvements in environmental quality and national health following its execution, by prioritizing environmental management goals based on 7 ranked environmental and ecological risks. It involves the public in the risk perception and evaluation phases, as well as in the environmental decision-making process, ultimately fostering support for establishing a clear and efficient national policy and environmental protection strategies.
