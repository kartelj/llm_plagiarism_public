The analysis of B2B business issues in electronic media is the focus of this thesis. It closely examines electronic media services and the impact of contemporary e-business technologies on the utilization of these services. It stresses the significance of customer relationship management in electronic media's B2B operations. Particular emphasis is given to innovative techniques and technologies relating to relationship management with electronic media stakeholders. The thesis also explores how public broadcasters can enhance stakeholder relationship management by using cutting-edge e-business technologies like social media, digital TV, interactive TV, and mobile computing. The thesis developed a customer relationship model specifically for electronic media's B2B operations, which facilitates the application of sophisticated CRM concepts and services and encourages collaboration with stakeholders. It also discusses how to combine various media types and services into a singular electronic media business system. This integration involves information, processes, application components, and human resources. An examination of the proposed customer relationship model was carried out in the dissertation's experimental section, using Serbia's Radio Television e-business system. Experiment results align with the hypothesis that integrating CRM into the electronic media business system enhances business efficacy, synchronises electronic media's business operations, and ultimately boosts client satisfaction and loyalty.
