The primary objective of the Doctoral Dissertation research is to establish a framework for a comprehensive research project aimed at enhancing the decision-making and data mining model for numerous analyses: mining association rules and prediction, and utilising the results for effective managerial decisions. The research aims to analyse and implement a system of association rules to refine the decision-making model of senior business system managers to achieve highly effective decisions. Contemporary scientific methods from business intelligence have been employed in this research. The key hypothesis: "Enhancements of the business decision-making model are achievable via a system of association rules" was ratified during the research. The significance of business intelligence in developing a model that can optimise decision-making efficiency for managers is emphasised. The usage of association rules for research purposes possesses enormous business potential. The business decision-making model using association rules has been developed and demonstrated. It is evident that this part of business intelligence is highly salient and has substantial potential. Concluding remarks and future research recommendations have been proffered, aiming to make a meaningful scientific and professional contribution towards improving business decision-making.
