Construction industries are huge and complex. Given that contractors execute a considerable portion of construction works, the successfulness of these projects depends mainly on their capabilities and qualifications. Therefore, the selection of an eligible contractor is a vital role that involves a critical decision to be made in each project. To do that effectively, it is better to conduct a prequalification process to evaluate their eligibility prior to the bid awarding stage where the final decision of the selection is made. Since the problem represents a typical multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) problem, the AHP method was used. The aim of this disertation is to propose a model to help the Libyan Central Committee of Tendering (in further text: Commitee) in prequalifying future candidate contractors. The model was evaluated on four Serbian construction companies and consists of four criteria namely, experience, technical capability, managerial capability, and human capability. A sensitivity analysis was done to test the robustness of this model. We conclude that the proposed model can offer a reliable framework for the Libyan Central Committee of Tendering when exercising such a prioritization decision. Further, we can say that the proposed model would work efficiently, yielding acceptable results, and succeed in dragging reasonable decisions in construction contractor prequalification process, which definitely enhances the credibility and transparency of bid awarding processes in the country.
