The subject of this doctoral dissertation is further development of the methodology for construction and evaluation of composite indicators created by experts from the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the Joint Research Center (JRC). Composite indicators are metrics formed when individual indicators that measure different aspects of the observed multidimensional concept are weighted and aggregated. Decision makers increasingly use composite indicators to rank and evaluate entities on various topics. The OECD-JRC methodology provides useful guidelines for the complex process of construction the methodological framework of the composite indicator. However, the weighting method and the robustness and sensitivity analysis are the steps of the methodology that continue to attract attention. The aim of the weighting method proposed in this doctoral dissertation is to determine the weighting scheme which maximizes the stability of the metric, measured by the sum of standard deviations of relative contributions of indicators. In order to define the model constraints the bootstrap IvanoviÄ‡ distance (I-distance) is proposed, while the metaheuristics enhanced Scatter Search (eSS) is used to solve the defined optimization problem. The new method takes into account the stability of the composite indicator during the process of weighting scheme determination and proposes a data-driven weighting scheme which reduces the level of intuitivity and overcomes the fact that the robustness analysis is often not conducted in the process of construction and evaluation of composite indicators. According to the experimental results, it is shown that the proposed weighting method can be successfully applied in the process of construction and evaluation of composite indicators.
