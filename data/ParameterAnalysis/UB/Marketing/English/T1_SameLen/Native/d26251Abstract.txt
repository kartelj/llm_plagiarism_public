The subject of this doctoral dissertation research is the development of a smart library model based on big data technologies and services. The central research problem discussed in the thesis is the development of big data infrastructure and smart library services that enable intelligent searches and recommendations from the library content. A particular focus of the paper is an examination of the possibility of integrating the developed model into a smart educational environment in order to improve the quality of the educational process. The thesis presents a model of the smart library as an integral part of the educational system that would improve quality level and comprehesivness of learning resources and increase the motivation of its users through content-aware recommendations. The model described in the thesis considers the possibilities of applying a big data system for the collection, analysis, processing and visualization of data from multiple sources, and the integration of data into the smart library. The goal of developing a smart library is to improve the libraryâ€™s business process and to offer users innovative methods to search and content use. The thesis discusses the perspective of the implementation of a big data solution for smart libraries as a part of a continuous learning process, with the aim of improving the results of library operations by integrating traditional systems with big data technology. In addition to the above system components, the model includes the infrastructure and integration of a recommender system for collaborative filtering by incorporating multiple sources of differential data with big data technologies. Within the evaluation of the model, testing and measurement of the relevant performance parameters which influence the efficiency of the proposed model were carried out.
