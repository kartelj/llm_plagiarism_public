The negotiation process, which is complex and dynamic, aims to find a solution that allows all participants to attain their objectives. Establishing a detailed and concentrated communication system involves understanding information needs, their significance, communication avenues, frequency of interaction, and effectiveness. The necessity for effective bargaining and awareness of events that could impact value creation validates these communication needs. This paper investigates and analyzes the impact of marketing communication on business negotiation and value creation. The doctoral dissertation's research issue focuses on examining the relationship between marketing communication tools and business negotiation phases as means of generating additional value. Recognizing business negotiation as a business philosophy, with marketing communication playing a critical role, allows the company to reap numerous benefits or create value-added elements. By questioning the target audience, it aids in assessing the influence of marketing communications, and consequently, their impact on business negotiations. Empirical research was conducted in this context to assess the contribution of individual communication channels and negotiation process stages. Linear regression analyses were also carried out on the entire sample, divided into buyers and sellers.
