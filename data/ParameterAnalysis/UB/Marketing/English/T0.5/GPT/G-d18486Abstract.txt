The doctoral thesis "Planning of Marketing Communication Strategy in Cultural-Educational Institutions for Children" presents a systemized collection of theoretical knowledge based on prior research into marketing communication strategies in cultural and educational institutions for children. It also includes practical knowledge gained from years of experience working in a children's cultural institution founded by the City of Belgrade, as well as various children and youth cultural projects. The research aims to establish parity in the treatment of children's cultural-educational institutions with other cultural institutions catering to an older demographic, considering the lack of comprehensive literature addressing this issue. The thesis addresses the problem of market thinking unawareness in children's cultural institutions, which poses a direct threat to the institution's survival and future growth. The research methodology included interviews, focus groups, surveys, and case studies, and involved the analysis of both public and private children and youth institutions in Serbia and the surrounding region, in comparison with similar institutions outside the region. The paper examines the challenges of implementing marketing communication strategies and public relations, and illustrates how children's institutions plan and execute these strategies. It highlights successful examples for a thorough comparison. It also explores the unique aspects of marketing communication in the culture and education sector, and the necessary correlation between non-profit marketing and public relations. The paper emphasizes the need for children's cultural institutions to secure a competitive position, retain current patrons, attract potential audiences, and awaken cultural interest among non-traditional audiences. The study identifies insufficient audience numbers as a barrier to the growth of cultural-educational institutions. It argues that through the use of integrated marketing communications and public relations, these institutions can collaborate with schools to cultivate children's cultural interests, develop cultural habits, and promote healthier adulthood. The paper's fundamental hypothesis, which is supported by theoretical and empirical research, asserts that the successful market positioning of children's cultural and educational institutions requires the ongoing implementation of marketing communication strategies. The study concludes that marketing, in its broadest sense, is essential in the field of culture and education. Despite the significant difference between the profit and non-profit sectors, basic marketing concepts such as providing demanded services/products and facilitating mutually beneficial exchanges can be applied to both.
