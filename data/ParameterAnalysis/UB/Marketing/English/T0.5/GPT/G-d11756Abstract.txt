The construction sector is vast and intricate, with contractors carrying out a substantial portion of the work. As such, the success of these projects largely hinges on the contractor's skills and qualifications. Selecting a suitable contractor is therefore crucial, requiring a significant decision for each project. An effective way to accomplish this is by implementing a prequalification process to assess contractors' eligibility before the final selection stage during the bid awarding process. This issue is a classic example of a multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) problem, which we addressed using the AHP method. The goal of this dissertation is to develop a model to assist the Libyan Central Committee of Tendering (hereafter referred to as the Committee) in the prequalification of prospective contractors. This model, evaluated using four Serbian construction companies, is based on four criteria: experience, technical capability, managerial ability, and human resources. A sensitivity analysis was conducted to verify the model's robustness. Our findings suggest that the proposed model provides a dependable framework for the Committee to use in making prioritization decisions. Furthermore, we believe that the model will operate effectively, produce satisfactory outcomes, and facilitate rational decisions in the contractor prequalification process. This will undoubtedly enhance the integrity and transparency of the bid awarding procedures in Libya.
