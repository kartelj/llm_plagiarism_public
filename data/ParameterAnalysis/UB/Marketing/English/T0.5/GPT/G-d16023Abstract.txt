Information technologies (IT) are the driving forces behind societal and business evolution in the modern world. They are responsible for altering business systems and organizational operations in the current business landscape. The increasing use of project management skills, methods, and techniques has enhanced management systems in organizations, with the goal of gaining a competitive edge in the market. IT project management within organizations involves aligning IT and business strategies to meet the demands of both internal and external stakeholders. The extent and sophistication of IT application are contingent on the organization's capacity and the strategies employed in executing business plans. For an IT strategy to be successful, a framework for effective and efficient technology implementation is necessary. Thus, organizations need to use competency and capacity evaluation systems to establish a quality foundation for value creation through IT. Maturity models serve as contemporary tools for assessing organizational competency and capacity in project management. Past research and studies conducted by the academic and professional community suggest two paths in analyzing organizational maturity. The use of universal maturity assessment models across different project types has led to the neglect of competencies unique to specific industries. Furthermore, maturity models used in the IT industry do not consider the analysis of project and organizational competencies and capacities. This thesis aims to develop a comprehensive model for organizational maturity assessment that incorporates both evaluation systems. To create this comprehensive model for IT project management maturity assessment, primary data gathered through quantitative and qualitative empirical research were utilized. Organizations with a well-defined IT component in their business strategy were included in the study. A 360-degree analysis and evaluation of the organization were conducted from the viewpoints of IT experts, project managers, directors, investors, and end users. This is the first time such research has been carried out in the Republic of Serbia, with only partial results available internationally for some general and specific evaluation aspects. The research findings support the primary hypothesis that it is feasible to develop a model based on competencies, processes, documentation, management systems, and metrics for IT project management. These elements influence the value delivered, knowledge management, project performance, and the project management organizational system. Based on the proposed model, reference measures for six maturity levels were established, allowing for comparison of Serbian organizations in terms of their best-practice IT project management. Moreover, the suggested model can be implemented in a modular fashion, depending on organizational needs and market demand. The comprehensive model for IT project management maturity assessment proposed in this thesis can be advantageous to both the academic and professional communities, as it can contribute to the enhancement and expansion of theoretical approaches and frameworks for maturity assessment, the evaluation of organizational competencies and capacities in IT project management, and the determination of the strategic direction of organizational development.
