The advancement of contemporary information and communication technologies has facilitated the growth of teaching and learning opportunities through the use of innovative methods and tools that enhance the quality of e-education. Furthermore, smart learning environments and the Internet of Things have brought about changes in teaching and learning techniques, applicable in both conventional educational settings and virtual community spaces. However, many new ideas relating to collective intelligence and collaborative learning remain undefined both theoretically and methodologically within the context of e-education and smart learning environments. One such concept is crowdsourcing, which leverages the collective knowledge and abilities of a group to complete a task. Crowdsourcing has proven to be an effective innovation in education, research, and problem-solving within the educational sphere. This dissertation posits and demonstrates that the creation and application of crowdsourcing models in smart learning environments can enhance educational performance and quality, boost student motivation, and improve the overall outcomes of the educational process. In the experimental segment of this doctoral dissertation, three research projects were conducted in two higher education institutions to validate the suggested crowdsourcing models in various educational settings. The evaluation results verified the significant potential of these models, demonstrating students' readiness to cooperate, their problem-solving abilities, their capacity to produce quality solutions, and their high level of self-organization.
