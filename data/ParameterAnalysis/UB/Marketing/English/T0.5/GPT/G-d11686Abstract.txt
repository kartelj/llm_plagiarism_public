Designing a sufficient logistics network provides a suitable foundation for effective supply chain management. A well-structured logistics network can give a company a competitive edge, helping them navigate increasingly stringent environmental regulations and business uncertainties. The configuration of a logistics network, including location, facilities, and technology, is a crucial strategic issue in supply chain management, significantly impacting overall performance. This paper presents research on integrated models of forward and reverse logistics supply.

These integrated models, also known as closed-loop supply chains, are networks that incorporate traditional channels and logistics activities, as well as return channels. The development of such an integrated network aims to reduce costs across the entire supply chain, increase profits, and achieve specific legal and regulatory goals related to environmental concerns.

This paper posits that operations research methods, based on mathematical models of the phenomena and processes under consideration, can effectively inform decision-making in a logistics system that includes supply and reverse processes. The research aims to contribute to the development of an integrated model of supply logistics and reverse logistics. The challenge is to determine an integrated logistics network that unites the logistics and reverse logistics supply networks, thereby enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of the entire supply chain.

In this dissertation, we introduce five models that address the issues of location selection and routing in integrated logistics models of supply and reverse logistics. These problems are tackled using multi-criteria analysis and heuristic methods. One of the location selection models is solved using the fuzzy AHP method, while four NP hard problems are solved using heuristic methods. Heuristics based on the Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS) method were developed for mathematical models with one or more objective functions. For each of the four models solved using VNS, two algorithms were used. The Variable Neighborhood Descend (VND) is used for local search for all models.

Problems with a small number of nodes are solved optimally, and the results obtained with heuristics are compared with the optimal solutions. Optimal solutions are presented to evaluate and validate the solutions obtained by heuristics. The research results indicate that the developed heuristics offer solutions close to optimal, with significantly shorter execution times. The anticipated results should benefit researchers in the field studying logistics principles and science, as well as practitioners making logistical decisions in manufacturing companies.
