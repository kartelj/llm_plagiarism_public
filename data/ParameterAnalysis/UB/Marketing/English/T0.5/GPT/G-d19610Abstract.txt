This doctoral thesis explores the evolution of customer relationship management (CRM) within the digital operations of intelligent libraries. The primary issue investigated is the potential for incorporating a CRM system into an integrated library system (ILS), as a strategy to enhance library interactions with patrons and stakeholders. The research delves into the creation of a CRM model suitable for developing nations, focusing on the digital operations of intelligent libraries and utilizing open-source software. The model comprises of an integrated library management system, CRM system, intelligent technologies, mobile services, and social media services. An in-depth analysis of CRM research findings is also provided. The thesis outlines a CRM model and a method for its integration with the ILS. The suggested model depicts the infrastructure and architecture of the CRM system within the digital operations of intelligent libraries. Experimental research was carried out to examine the application of CRM concepts and intelligent technologies in libraries, and the readiness of librarians to adopt these technologies to enhance customer relations. A system for managing customer relations in an intelligent library was established based on the developed model by integrating CRM systems into an ILS. The results confirmed the primary hypothesis that incorporating CRM systems into the digital operations of intelligent libraries enhances library performance, optimizes library business processes, and improves patron communication.
