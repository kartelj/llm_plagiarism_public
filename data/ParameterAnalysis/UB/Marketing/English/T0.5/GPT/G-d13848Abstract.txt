The creation and implementation of new products and services can rejuvenate existing industries and establish entirely new ones. As such, the development and commercialization of new technologies are crucial for the global economy. Entrepreneurship is often seen as a catalyst for economic and social growth, as it fosters the creation of new companies, ideas, products, and services. Recently, social entrepreneurship has caught the attention of many researchers and practitioners due to its impact on job creation and fostering a healthy societal environment. 

Technological entrepreneurship begins with assessing the market value of new discoveries and technologies, aligning them with current or potential market needs, and converting these opportunities into commercialized products, services, or new ventures. Individuals who form teams to develop these new technological ventures play a significant role in this process. This type of organization is commonly referred to as a "technological startup" or simply a "startup", defined as a temporary organization established to find a sustainable and scalable business model. 

Startups often involve new ventures in innovative and cutting-edge technology fields, characterized by high dynamism, growth orientation, profit orientation, and the creation of new market values. Many entrepreneurs within these startups possess extensive technological knowledge and skills. However, due to their focus on technology and product or service development, they often neglect business orientation, which can lead to failure. 

This dissertation explores marketing and marketing orientation as a component of business orientation in the development process of technological entrepreneurial ventures. The goal is to develop a comprehensive model of how marketing orientation impacts the success of technological entrepreneurial ventures in the startup phase. Marketing orientation is defined as an organizational culture that efficiently drives organizational behavior and creates superior customer value, which is essential for business success. 

The dissertation examines the influence of marketing orientation on the development process of technological startups through competition orientation, customer orientation, and interfunctional coordination. It also analyzes the concept of entrepreneurial marketing through the components of entrepreneurial orientation: innovativeness, proactiveness, risk-taking, autonomy, and competitive aggressiveness. 

The dissertation also investigates the environmental impact, competitiveness level, and the role of mentorship in the development process of technological startups. Personal characteristics of successful entrepreneurs are also analyzed. 

Measuring the performance of technological startups presents a significant challenge as it differs from traditional success measurement methods used for established companies and large corporations. Based on a review of existing scientific literature and qualitative research conducted within a specific target audience, 13 developmental goals for technological startups have been identified. Quantitative research has generated four success factors: success of idea and concept, success of value proposition, success of value exchange, and success of business model. 

The results of the quantitative research presented in this dissertation highlight the significant role and impact of various marketing and entrepreneurial orientation components on the success of technological startups. They also explain the influence of environmental competitiveness and mentorship on the development process. The final part of the research identifies the personal characteristics of successful technological startup founders.
