This doctoral thesis aims to elucidate the significance of special events both domestically and internationally. Since time immemorial, humans have congregated for various reasons. Such gatherings were deemed unique and extraordinary experiences, occurring infrequently, often due to specific circumstances or at the behest of an individual or governmental group. These events brought with them a sense of excitement and exclusivity. Today, the leisure and entertainment industry is a primary focus, having experienced rapid growth in recent years. It now holds a pivotal role in the service market, constantly generating innovative ways to deliver its services. Professional event planning agencies have gained global popularity, contributing significantly to business success, profit, and positive customer feedback in the service industry. Concurrently, decision making is a critical task that every manager must undertake. Decisions are constantly being made, not only in relation to traditional management tasks, but also in the organization of special events. Decision making is not an isolated managerial function, but rather a common thread linking all other functions. Managers across all organizational levels are involved in a range of decisions, from operational and tactical to strategic. This thesis will demonstrate how utilizing a group decision-making system can enhance the organization of special events.
