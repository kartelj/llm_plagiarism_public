This dissertation focuses on the analysis of remote sensing methodology, specifically the collection, preparation, and processing of data for classification purposes using statistical methods. It proposes a method for defining sensitivity zones in the classification of phenomena, primarily through the use of multivariate statistical analysis. Remote sensing, a field that collects information about an object without direct contact, is explained in detail. It involves recording reflected or emitted energy from the object, processing, analyzing, and applying the information. The dissertation also discusses the relationship between remote sensing and GIS, a tool necessary for spatial data analysis.

The study emphasizes the importance of classifying remotely-sensed data, particularly the pixels of an image, based on their intensity and color characteristics. The multivariate analysis approach is used to analyze multidimensional measurements obtained from each pixel. The dissertation also discusses Data clustering techniques and Discriminant Analysis, with the latter being the main focus of the proposed method.

Bayesian decision theory, a statistical approach to classification, is also discussed. This approach quantifies the compromise between different classification decisions using probability and cost or effort. Discriminant analysis, which deals with the problem of group separation and the allocation of observations in predefined groups, is also highlighted.

The dissertation reviews techniques used for classification in remote sensing and introduces the concept of digital images, their theoretical foundations, and basic processing techniques. It also reviews widely used classification methods, which are divided into Supervised and Unsupervised classifications. The accuracy of the classified map, generated by remote sensing, is evaluated by comparing it with reference data.

The research aims to develop a methodology that improves overall classification accuracy and reduces the time and resources required for classification using the sensitivity zone. The dissertation discusses the problem of classification in detail, proposes a new method to calculate and apply the sensitivity zone in remote sensing, and highlights its advantages over other classification methods. The proposed method involves a two-phase classification process: the first phase uses discriminant analysis to determine the discrimination (hyper)plane quickly, and the second phase identifies entities in the sensitivity zone and classifies pixels using the k-nearest neighbors method (kNN).

The dissertation includes case studies on the application of the sensitivity zone in precision agriculture and discusses the problem of separating crops from soil or other objects. The proposed method was tested on several different types of crops and compared with other classification methods. The study concludes with answers to the set goals and hypotheses and includes an appendix describing the software solution developed for the research and data analysis.
