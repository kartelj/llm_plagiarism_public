The doctoral thesis primarily revolves around the domain of the information society, its progression, and methods of monitoring and measuring its advancements. The thesis encapsulates existing research and theories on the subject of the information society, its evolution, its different forms, factors influencing its growth, and various international initiatives aimed at steering the worldwide progress of the information society. The thesis explores methods to quantify the information society, a complex concept characterized by a set of interrelated indicators, and investigates the most suitable metrics for observing, measuring, and evaluating the actual state of the information society. 

Along with providing a classification and evolution path of benchmarking indicators, which are the foundation of every methodology aimed at quantifying the information society, the thesis includes an overview of the most pertinent methodologies used for evaluating the information society globally. The primary focus of this work is the creation of a unique model that outlines necessary actions to monitor and evaluate advancements in Serbia's information society. This model assumes a theoretical foundation, compatibility with EU standards for wide use in international projects, and compliance with the specifics of Serbia's information society and its potential for investment and further development.

The model's formulation includes selecting a set of Information Society Indicators (ISI) in line with EU standards, but modified to suit Serbia's characteristics and development potential, transforming the ISI set to enable ranking according to their significance for monitoring the information society, extracting the most relevant ISI subset, and defining a sub-model that quantifies the degree of the digital divide through a unique compound indicator - the Digital Polarization Index (DPI). The model was tested on Serbia, monitoring and analyzing its information society over a five-year period. The verification process involved statistical monitoring, quantification, and data analysis, and analyzing the results to determine the current state, identify and quantify 'critical points' in Serbia's information society development, and forecast its future progress.

The thesis's professional contribution is the evaluation of the information society development in Serbia from the population and economy's perspective. It contributes by quantifying and evaluating the intensity of the digital divide and its trends, and identifying the most digitally underdeveloped groups within Serbia's population. The basic scientific contribution is the creation of a model for monitoring and evaluating the information society's development, based on the I-distance method and cluster analysis, two suitably combined methods of multivariate analysis. The initial set of indicators was reduced to the most relevant subset after ranking according to their I-distance value and applying cluster analysis. The subset includes the most significant indicators for assessing the information society. By reducing the number of indicators while preserving the valuable information content, the model's practical applicability has significantly increased.

Moreover, the thesis defines a model for quantifying individual and total digital divide in different areas by introducing the digital polarization index. The model's main features are its generality, flexibility, and openness for adding or changing its basic components. This allows for the identification, definition, and calculation of various individual sub-indices of digital polarization used in calculating the total DPI. These model features are valuable considering the rapid changes in the ICT area. The thesis's social contribution is its potential for application in monitoring and quantifying the information society and guiding and harmonizing its development. The model can be used as a strategic decision support tool and a tool for observing and minimizing the digital divide. It can also support the evaluation of different complex social phenomena outside the information society framework.
