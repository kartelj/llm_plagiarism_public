Modern business is characterized by numerous significant technological advancements, one of which is the necessity to enhance business communication through referential innovations such as contact centers. These centers play a key role in ensuring productivity and effectiveness as they are evaluated by clients and potential clients based on the quality of the bank's services and products. Optimizing the operations of a contact center involves identifying certain variables such as the type of center, the technology used, communication channels, employee training, staffing levels, shift patterns, and employee supervision. All these factors greatly impact business communication. The emergence of the first contact centers in the early 1950s brought about significant changes to business communication. In many respects, business communication can be improved by diverse organizational contact centers.
