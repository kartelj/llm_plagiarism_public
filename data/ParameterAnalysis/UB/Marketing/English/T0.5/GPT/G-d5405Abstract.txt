Despite the implementation of various quality models over the past two decades, health care organizations continue to grapple with nonconformities and errors. Consequently, the quality of these organizations and their services remains subpar. The differing outcomes of these quality models, although based on the same standard, regulation, or concept, could be attributed to the translation process of the guideline into the implemented model. Often, non-clinical processes vital to the quality of health care organizations and services are overlooked.

Moreover, patients lack sufficient, accessible, and appropriate information on the quality of different health care organizations, treatments, or diagnoses to make informed decisions. As a result, high-quality health care organizations don't receive the recognition they deserve, and patients are left without the necessary information to make choices based on their priorities. 

This situation highlights two main challenges in improving quality in health care organizations and reaping the benefits thereof. The first challenge stems from the transformation of general standards, guidelines, and regulations into a specific model for a particular health care organization, which often neglects non-health care processes. The second challenge arises from the reporting of achieved quality. The overwhelming amount of data on parameters hinders patients' decision-making process and complicates comparisons between health care organizations. 

Viewing health care organizations as business systems through the lens of the Anatomical Structure Model developed at the Faculty of Organizational Science allows for the identification of all elements influencing the quality of health care services. This perspective gives rise to the Model for Quality Improvement of Health Care Business Systems. This model serves as a bridge between certain policies, standards, guidelines, or concepts, and the concrete model for quality assurance, control, and management of health care organizations. 

The model, which comprises graphical, verbal, and mathematical components, enables the calculation of the quality of each element of the health care business system. This, in turn, facilitates quality comparisons between health care business systems using this model or their component elements. The model's application in two primary health care business systems has demonstrated its potential to enhance the quality of health care business systems.
