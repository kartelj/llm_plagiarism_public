The purpose of this study is to introduce, scrutinize, and identify various real options and examine their impact on the generation of shareholder value. The objective is to suggest a novel method for equity valuation, specifically for corporations with high risk and high flexibility. The study provides a comprehensive review of modern strategic concepts and their connection to the creation of shareholder value. A particular strategy allows a company to have multiple real options. A literature review helped identify various indicators of flexibility and uncertainty, implying the potential existence of real options. These indicators were utilized to categorize corporations and identify those with valuable real options. The financial performance metrics of companies with high flexibility and uncertainty were also calculated and their attributes outlined. This doctoral dissertation scrutinizes and addresses prevalent stock pricing models. The excess return is linked to risk, real options, and general strategies based on all findings. This study employs panel data analysis. Various definitions of growth options were used to gauge the sensitivity of the proposed method. The proposed approach was further validated by comparing predicted and actual excess return results. Real options indicators are significant in explaining the risk-return relationship, although the market appears to be more cautious when valuing these options. The cost-leadership strategy enhances the excess return for investors.
