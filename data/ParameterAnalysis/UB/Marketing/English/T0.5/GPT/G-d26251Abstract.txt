This doctoral dissertation research delves into the creation of a big data-based smart library model and its associated services. The primary research issue explored in the paper is the establishment of a big data infrastructure and intelligent library services that facilitate smart searches and content suggestions from the library's database. The paper specifically investigates the potential of incorporating the developed model into a smart educational setup to enhance the educational process's quality. 

The thesis introduces a smart library model as a crucial component of the educational system, designed to enhance the quality and comprehensiveness of learning resources and boost user motivation through personalized recommendations. The model detailed in the thesis explores the application of a big data system for gathering, analyzing, processing, and visualizing data from various sources and integrating this data into the smart library. 

The objective of creating a smart library is to streamline the library's operations and provide users with novel methods of searching and utilizing content. The thesis also considers the potential of implementing a big data solution for smart libraries as part of an ongoing learning process, aiming to improve library operations' outcomes by merging traditional systems with big data technology. 

Beyond these system components, the model also encompasses the infrastructure and integration of a recommender system for collaborative filtering, which combines different data sources with big data technologies. The model's evaluation involved testing and measuring relevant performance indicators that impact the proposed model's efficiency.
