Business intelligence is a crucial component in decision-making processes, playing a vital role in the successful operation and management of any organization. Its primary functions include data extraction, storage, and analysis. Recent studies in the field of Business Intelligence have suggested that valuable insights can be gained from unstructured data, enhancing decision-making across all levels of management. The success of the Smart Grid concept relies heavily on an organization's ability to create a ubiquitous environment for all data extractors and decision points. Innovations brought about by Smart Grid technologies are revolutionizing the electrical power industry, impacting all aspects of the electricity supply chain, and leading to alterations in market structures and business models. The need for business intelligence and performance management infrastructures in comprehensive energy systems adopting Smart Grid technologies is widely acknowledged. This dissertation presents a business intelligence model specifically designed for B2B e-business of the transmission system and electricity market operator, aimed at monitoring electricity market activity through necessary information and data flows. The development of a Business Intelligence solution tailored for electricity power systems necessitates a well-structured methodology and a defined architecture that outlines the fundamental elements of a data warehouse. This dissertation proposes a methodology for designing a business intelligence system, leveraging Kimball’s approach to model a business intelligence system as a foundation for implementing new data warehouse objects with minimal reliance on predefined objects within the SAP environment. A "bottom-up" approach was employed, along with a modified dimension life-cycle adapted for Accelerated SAP for Business Warehouse methodology. The methodology was put into practice, resulting in a business intelligence system for monitoring electricity market activity. The efficacy of the proposed solution was evaluated in the Public Enterprise "Elektromreža Srbije". Findings indicate that business intelligence solutions can enhance market management in data-rich environments and can be effectively utilized for reporting across various business sectors of the organization. Furthermore, comparative analysis results provide guidance and suggestions for combined methodologies that can be employed to develop robust business intelligence systems.
