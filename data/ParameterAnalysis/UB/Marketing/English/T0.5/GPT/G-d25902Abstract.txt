The doctoral thesis research focuses on the creation of crowdsourcing models in intelligent cities, utilizing the Internet of Things (IoT) and mobile technology. The thesis examines the potential of incorporating crowdsourcing, IoT, and mobile technology to enhance smart city services. The study concentrates on analyzing, defining, and implementing various crowdsourcing models to improve living standards in smart cities. 

The thesis primarily investigates the readiness of citizens to adopt crowdsourcing services in a smart city. The initial phase of the research aims to identify those crowdsourcing services that will stimulate citizen participation, based on IoT and mobile technology. The study is centered on cities that are yet to fully adopt smart city standards. 

The methodological approach to determine citizen readiness involved analyzing crowdsourcing models such as crowd wisdom, crowdfunding, crowdvoting, and crowdsensing, and their application in areas like traffic, environmental conservation, utilities, and health. Data was collected over two years in Belgrade, using a survey of 210 citizens. 

The findings suggest that citizens are prepared to accept crowdsourcing services based on crowdfunding, crowdvoting, and crowd wisdom models. They also show an interest in environmental conservation and public transportation. These results not only indicate priority services for implementation but can also inform the initiation of other smart city projects. The methodology and conclusions could form part of a broader framework for selecting implementation projects in other cities. 

The thesis presents the development of the Smart Belgrade crowdsourcing platform, designed to encourage citizen collaboration towards common goals, utilizing collective intelligence and an organized online community. The platform allows smart city citizens to stay informed about current issues in ecology, utilities, and public transportation. Registered users can contribute to problem-solving, propose new initiatives, post relevant information, and report city issues. 

A crowdvoting service has also been implemented on the platform. The model proposed in the thesis aims to enhance citizen information and participation in a smart city. The thesis includes an evaluation of the model to test the system and measure parameters that influence its effectiveness and usefulness. The results support the main hypothesis that the development and use of crowdsourcing models based on IoT and mobile technology enhance citizen involvement in information collection, dissemination, and use in a smart city.
