As the Republic of Serbia moves closer to joining the European Union, significant reforms are anticipated, particularly in the health-social system. It is increasingly evident that Serbia cannot solely depend on state health systems due to financial and organizational constraints. Hence, private health institutions are expected to play a crucial role in Serbia's healthcare system. Although there are already a number of such institutions in Serbia, this sector is still developing and its dynamic growth is forecasted for the future. The success of these private health institutions largely hinges on effective marketing and sales strategies, as well as the ability to anticipate challenges in the competitive healthcare market. Defining and developing a model of inter-dependency between sales and marketing activities, and understanding their impact on brand positioning and development, is a key managerial task for these private health institutions. This article aims to provide basic recommendations based on past experiences and scientific research projects.
