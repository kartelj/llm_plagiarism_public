The primary objective of this doctoral thesis is to create hybrid models to enhance the multi-criteria decision-making process. Although existing tools for this process have proven effective and reliable, their main drawback is their lack of consideration for mutual comparison, conditionality, and logical dependencies between decision-making attributes. Thus, the thesis proposes multi-criteria models that combine traditional and fuzzy methods of multi-criteria analysis, along with the application of interpolate Boolean algebra. The main hypothesis is that this combination of methods can model the decision-making process more effectively than a single method of multi-criteria analysis. Traditional methods often used in literature to solve decision-making problems are limited by their inability to adequately present uncertain/imprecise attributes. This creates an ideal environment for the development of fuzzy set theory, which allows for the analysis of uncertain attributes using fuzzy numbers. Therefore, this doctoral thesis develops hybrid models that integrate traditional and fuzzy methods of multi-criteria analysis to address these limitations and produce more reliable results. Additionally, models are proposed based on interpolate Boolean algebra, which considers the logical interactions of attributes. This expands the capabilities of decision-makers' linguistic statements and provides a more realistic perspective of the problem. The proposed models are tested on the examples of ranking business banks and telecommunications equipment suppliers. An integrated model combining traditional and fuzzy methods of multi-criteria analysis is suggested to solve the business bank selection problem. Conversely, a model that combines a two-stage multi-criteria analysis method and a hybrid model that includes an analysis of logical attribute interaction using Boolean algebra is proposed to solve the supplier ranking problem. The research results indicate that combining multi-criteria analysis methods can overcome the limitations of traditional methods and surpass the results of individual multi-criteria methods. Moreover, applying interpolate Boolean algebra allows for modeling attribute interactions and interdependencies, making it significantly easier for decision-makers to accurately represent the actual decision-making problem. The doctoral thesis's key contribution is the enhancement of the decision-making system through the development of combined multi-criteria models, particularly in situations where decision-making attributes cannot be accurately determined due to certain conditionalities and logical interactions. The primary motivation for this paper is its potential practical application in real business systems.
