The paper aims to increase understanding of quality costing in the current landscape, and to evaluate the need for a quality cost model within a process-systemic framework. The research, conducted on 186 companies across various sectors, included only those familiar with quality costs. The company database for the study was created based on three indicators of their familiarity with quality costs. The findings indicate a high level of awareness of the significance of quality costs and an increasing number of companies managing these costs. The factors that influence quality costs management systems were identified and the relationships between variables defining these systems were analyzed. Also, the ISO 9001:2015 standard requirements, which have a statistically significant relationship with the variables defining quality costs management, were chosen based on the companies' views on the importance of their fulfillment. The research findings highlight the need for a quality cost model within a process-systemic framework. Thus, this paper uses the PAF model at the process level to propose a quality cost model where quality cost elements are considered in relation to process outputs, taking into account the principle that one process's outputs affect another process's quality. The model calculates quality costs for each process at two points: current (before measures are taken) and expected (after measures are taken). Necessary control or improvement measures are taken based on the analysis of nonconformity causes and the PAF model's assumption that preventive and appraisal activities reduce failure costs and total quality costs. The model views the difference between total quality costs at the two observed points as the maximum possible quality cost reduction for the observed process. This value is used to rank processes based on their priority for implementing defined control or improvement measures, given the PAF model's assumption that higher costs indicate lower quality and therefore a higher priority for such measures.
