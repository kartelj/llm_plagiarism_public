Financial institutions can enhance their efficiency, safety, and profitability in both local and global markets through the comprehensive management of financial risks. This paper provides a brief summary of the significance, role, and implications of managing financial risks in today's context, particularly focusing on financial risk models. Financial institutions, including deposit and non-deposit entities, financial intermediaries, and service providers, are exposed to various risks such as credit, interest rate, solvency, liquidity, market, operational, and technological risks, among others. The aggregate effect of these risks can lead to significant losses, even bankruptcy, due to their potential for horizontal and vertical spread. Most financial risks are complex and heterogeneous, and can lead to disproportionately large losses when they interact with other risks, continually amplifying their impacts. It is crucial for financial institutions to employ risk management strategies and information and communication technologies to identify, measure, and adjust all forms of uncertainty (risks). They can manage the level of uncertainty using new methods, financial derivatives (forwards, futures, options, swaps), securitization, and other tools. This allows financial institutions to engage in ventures that offer an acceptable return relative to the risk, thereby creating a business environment conducive to value creation and growth for their owners (stakeholders). The changes in the regulation of financial institutions, especially the banking sector (Basel II and Basel III), have significantly influenced these developments, tying the amount of capital to the anticipated level of credit risk and other risks such as market, operational, or liquidity risk.
