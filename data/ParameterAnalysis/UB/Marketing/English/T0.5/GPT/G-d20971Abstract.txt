Stochastic programming is a subset of operational research that explores methods to incorporate uncertainty into decision-making processes, acknowledging that not all necessary information is always readily available to the decision-maker. The primary challenge in applying stochastic programming is the uncertainty of parameters in the model and the fact that the optimal solution is defined for the deterministic equivalent of the original problem. Another challenge is assessing the quality of a specific deterministic equivalent from both the perspective of the value of the criterion function, which can be random, and the likelihood of satisfying stochastic constraints.

Stochastic programming is utilized in numerous areas, with common applications in production planning, supply chains, logistics, transportation, portfolio management, marketing, finance, and many other fields. There are three prevalent methods for solving stochastic programming problems: stochastic optimization, robust optimization, and chance constrained programming. These are the foundation of all research in this optimization field.

Robust optimization is a cautious approach that focuses on the worst-case scenario by defining a deterministic equivalent of the original problem that eliminates all uncertainty. Chance constrained programming is a method that deals with uncertainty in constraint parameters and employs various techniques to solve these problems. The assumption in this approach is that a stochastic and uncertain constraint must be met with a specific probability. The need to describe constraints in a way that the predetermined probability of satisfying constraints represents the risk that the obtained solution might not be fulfilled, which the decision-maker is willing to accept.

The primary and most challenging aspect of the chance constraint approach is tractability, primarily related to finding the appropriate probability distributions of the stochastic parameters. However, all these stochastic programming approaches complement each other in solving optimization problems with uncertainty, each with its own advantages and disadvantages.

This dissertation investigates different ways of dealing with uncertainty in mathematical models and developing a new approach to solving stochastic programming models. The dissertation's fundamental premise is that real-life stochastic programming problems can be effectively solved using a combination of classic deterministic optimization and simulation. The research aims to contribute to the field of stochastic programming by developing a new approach to solving weakly structured problems.

Specifically, the dissertation proposes a new method: the iterative optimization-simulation approach. This approach has two phases: an optimization phase, where the deterministic equivalent of the original problem is solved optimally, and a simulation phase, where the probability of satisfying constraints is verified through simulation. Each deterministic equivalent represents a new scenario checked using simulation. If the decision-maker is unsatisfied with the result, a new scenario with new deterministic values is defined for the original stochastic problem. The accumulated experience from checking scenarios is used to develop and formulate heuristics as simple rules for scenario generation.

The research's primary goal is to use the optimal solutions obtained through this approach to make sound managerial decisions that will achieve the goals and implement the stochastic models in real-life problems. The dissertation's most significant contribution is defining a new approach to solving stochastic optimization problems, creating an efficient method to solve stochastic models using a simulation approach. Furthermore, a new scenario will be proposed for solving stochastic optimization models, simplifying the application of appropriate algorithms to solve these models and implement them in the real world.
