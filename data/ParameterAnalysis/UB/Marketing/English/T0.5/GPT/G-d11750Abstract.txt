The doctoral thesis aims to explore and elucidate how group decision-making processes can enhance the system of business intelligence. In the realm of business, the term 'intelligence' traditionally refers to reporting or information designed to assist business decision-making. Viewed in this light, business intelligence aids in navigating new scenarios and speeds up and sharpens problem-solving. However, it diverges from the common psychological interpretation of the term, as it does not pertain to an individual's personal ability but to a technological tool implemented by an organization. Business intelligence is neither a product nor a system, but rather an architecture and a set of integrated operational applications and decision-supporting applications. It harnesses all data potentials, essentially the company's information and knowledge, to facilitate superior and relevant business decisions, and thereby the capacity to pinpoint new business opportunities. Assisting an individual decision-maker is a critical activity for any thriving corporate management. However, as business systems become increasingly complex and the accountability for decisions grows correspondingly, it is crucial to consider the diverse ideas and perspectives of team members, or the accumulated body of knowledge, for group decision-making. Furthermore, it is a mathematically confirmed truth that the collective knowledge of all team members invariably surpasses the knowledge of any single member, provided there is effective communication and resource sharing among the team. Conversely, there is a clear need for enhancing the quality of group decision-making. This is a continuous area of interest for researchers with substantial practical and theoretical experience. Consequently, the thesis will pay particular attention to the issues of knowledge acquisition, storage, and distribution; knowledge will form the backbone of the thesis and serve as the unifying thread of the paper.
