Historically, it was assumed that the primary objective of business organizations globally was profit generation. However, this notion has been challenged in recent years, particularly as several highly profitable organizations have nonetheless gone bankrupt. This raises the question, "What is necessary for an organization's sustainability?" Past research addressing this question has proposed several models to aid in crafting a sustainable business strategy. 

This doctoral dissertation aimed to develop a new sustainability model for organizations, utilizing multi-criteria decision-making models to aid in strategic decision-making. The research was conducted in multiple stages. The initial stage involved a literature review to gather information on relevant indicators for strategic decision-making. This was followed by an examination of indicators used in the Annual Sustainability Reports of top-rated global companies. 

150 indicators were selected, organized into strategic perspectives based on the Balanced Scorecard model, and the research was conducted with the involvement of strategic decision-makers. The collected data was then analyzed using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Varimax rotation to identify correlations and potential grouping among the indicators. The analysis revealed eight perspectives that accounted for 69.38% of the total sample. Indicators that best represented these perspectives were then selected. 

In the subsequent stage, the fuzzy DEMATEL method was employed to calculate the cause-effect relationship among the selected indicators. The results showed that the implementation of a sustainable organizational strategy depends on eight perspectives. The learning perspective, best represented by the "Exchange of Organizational Knowledge" indicator, was found to be the most significant. This was followed by leadership, sustainability, process, social responsibility, growth/market, client, and finance perspectives, in that order. Implementing the developed model should enhance an organization's chances of sustainability in the future.
