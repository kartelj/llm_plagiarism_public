The transition process in Central and Eastern Europe, including Serbia, necessitates the privatization of state and socially owned enterprises for its successful completion. It has been observed that these enterprises require restructuring before privatization. Various restructuring activities aim to enhance the performance, efficiency, and value for shareholders of these companies. This dissertation focuses on a restructuring methodology based on key value drivers. It also presents the definition of value, methods of measuring value creation, and value creation models. The goal is to help management understand the process of value creation through restructuring decisions related to operations, financing, and investments. To create value, management must adopt strategies that increase the return on invested capital, reduce risk, or a combination of both. The effectiveness of the restructuring is determined by the amount of value created, which is the difference between the equity value before and after restructuring. The equity value of a company equals the present value of its future discounted cash flows and depends on both the value of future cash flows and the average cost of capital. Therefore, to increase the equity value, it is crucial to increase cash flows and reduce business risks and the cost of capital. The appropriate method of selling equity contributes to the realized price of equity for companies undergoing restructuring when their equity is for sale to strategic and financial investors. This paper also discusses the analysis of public tenders and auctions as a method of selling equity of socially and state-owned enterprises undergoing restructuring and privatization. Through the research and analysis presented, this dissertation validates the hypothesis that company restructuring can increase their value and prepare them for sale to potential investors. The dissertation also confirms the feasibility of creating a restructuring model based on key value drivers that can be applied to any company. Finally, the analysis of privatization results in Serbia confirms that the model of selling socially and state-owned enterprises is the most efficient model of privatization in the later stages of the transition process.
