The thesis explores the potential for creating a flexible, adaptable model for measuring process performance. Modern organizational management is centered around process management, and the organization's success is tied to the success of these processes. This success is gauged using key performance indicators. The study also examines the relationship between the organization's top-level goals and process performance indicators in businesses that have adopted a process-oriented approach. The research includes an examination of how to enhance the adaptability and flexibility of the process performance measurement system, including a review and analysis of existing performance measurement models and the creation of a unique model that is adaptable and flexible. This development includes defining the model (its structure, connections, and interdependencies), applying it in a practical setting, and refining it based on the results obtained. The primary hypothesis argued and confirmed in the thesis is that formalizing the relationship between an organization's top-level goals and key process performance indicators can enhance the adaptability and flexibility of business performance measurement systems. A comprehensive literature review was conducted, leading to a scientific description and comparative analysis of existing process performance measurement models. Following this, a new process performance measurement model, named the GPI (Goal, Process, Indicator) model, was proposed. This model allows for the direct identification of the relationship between top-level goals and process performance indicators and offers a degree of flexibility and adaptability. A case study was then conducted, and the findings were used to refine the initially conceptualized model. The research findings and the proposed GPI model lay the groundwork for improved and simplified performance management and further research in this field.
