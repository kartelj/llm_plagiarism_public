This thesis examines the issue of B2B operations in electronic media, delving into the intricacies of electronic media services and the transformative effects of cutting-edge e-business technologies on their utilization. The study underscores the significance of Customer Relationship Management (CRM) in electronic media's B2B operations, with an emphasis on innovative techniques and technologies for managing relationships with stakeholders in the electronic media industry. The research also explores ways to enhance relationship management between public broadcasters and their stakeholders through the use of ground-breaking e-business technologies, such as social media, digital and interactive TV, and mobile computing. A CRM model for electronic media's B2B operations was created as part of the thesis, facilitating the introduction of sophisticated CRM concepts and services, and fostering collaboration with stakeholders. The study also considers the potential for integrating various media types and services into a unified electronic media business system, encompassing information, processes, application components, and human resources. The thesis includes an experimental section where the CRM model for B2B operations was tested within the e-business system of the Radio Television of Serbia. The results of the experiment substantiate the overarching hypothesis that incorporating and integrating CRM into the business system of electronic media boosts business performance, aligns all business processes of electronic media, and results in increased client satisfaction and loyalty.
