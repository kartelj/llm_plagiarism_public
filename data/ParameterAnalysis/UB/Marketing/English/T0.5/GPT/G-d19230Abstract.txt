This dissertation proposal examines the backing for operational production planning within small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), with a particular focus on scheduling activities, the most complex aspect of operational planning. SMEs are the primary type of businesses in both Serbia and the European Union (EU-28), particularly within the manufacturing sector. The most prevalent forms of production in these enterprises are Make-to- Order (MTO) production and process-based production organization. The Job Shop scheduling problem is a key part of short-term production planning in these businesses. Given the direct link between operational production planning and the transformation of raw materials and semi-manufactured goods, it's crucial to properly manage manufacturing resources (materials, machines, tools, labour, time, capital, information, market) in the production process. 

The proposal provides an overview of key theoretical concepts such as SMEs, support for SMEs, SME management processes, production planning, and resource management. It also defines the process of operational production planning in terms of its included activities. Production scheduling problems, including scheduling products to machines and determining time slots for manufacturing activities, are identified as common issues in operational production planning. The goal of an effective schedule is to work within the capacity constraints of production resources, thus the proposal emphasizes the need to improve scheduling activities and align them with the specific needs of each enterprise. 

The proposal also discusses typical problems in operational production planning, along with the models, methods, and techniques used to solve them. Some of these problems are classified as NP-hard problems in operational research, making the search for the best solution a complex task. Therefore, heuristic approaches to solving these problems are given special attention in the literature. 

The dissertation proposal includes a literature review based on quantitative and qualitative analyses of scientific papers relevant to the topic. It also presents a new research project proposal, justified through a critical review of the literature. The proposal assumes that operational planning of production in Serbian SMEs is underdeveloped. A survey of 79 companies supports this assumption, indicating a limited understanding and application of modern operations management methods in operational planning and resource management. The proposal concludes that SMEs require appropriate support in operational planning and resource management. 

The dissertation proposes a model for supporting operational production planning and resource management in SMEs. This model involves six phases: examining the problem, defining the support goal, outlining the support package, establishing performance indicators, providing support, and analyzing performance. The proposal also defines a scheduling problem typical of small-scale, single product production, known as a Dual Resource Constrained Flexible Job Shop. This problem is modeled using the MatLab programming language, and solved using a multi-objective genetic algorithm metaheuristic known as NSGA-II. The dissertation further discusses the application of this metaheuristic, which greatly improves problem-solving for the DRCFJS problem.
