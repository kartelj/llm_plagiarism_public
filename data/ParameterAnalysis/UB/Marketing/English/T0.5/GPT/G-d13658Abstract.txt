The mining industry's continuous demand for innovative solutions, enhanced efficiency, dependability, and safety throughout all production phases - from planning and design to the eventual halt of mining operations - fosters collaboration between the mining sector and research, science, education, technology, work organization, and the establishment of norms and standardization. Mining production outcomes are not solely reliant on natural conditions, workforce expertise, technical equipment, industrial-economic, and socio-political environment. They significantly depend on the efficiency of supervision and management structures, or in other words, mining management. This understanding guided the selection and framing of the doctoral dissertation theme presented here, which focuses on the impact of international standards in the Serbian mining industry. The research aims to evaluate global and national accomplishments in this field, examine the philosophy of management systems and international standards, and assess the adaptability and adequacy of management systems based on international standards when applied in the multifaceted conditions of the mining industry. Our research confirms the initial hypothesis that international standards are insufficient for effective mining system management. Consequently, we propose a structural model that integrates international standards, adequately addresses mining management needs, and targets the goals of exploitation, safety, production, and environmental protection. The issues addressed in this doctoral dissertation are both crucial and urgent, and the dissertation holds both scientific and practical relevance for the mining industry. This is evidenced by the research results obtained in both areas.
