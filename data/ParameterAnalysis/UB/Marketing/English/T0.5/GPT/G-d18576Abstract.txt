In the fast-paced and competitive business environment, corporations and their management teams must quickly adapt to market shifts. This requires a focus on creating new value and maximizing returns on investments in knowledge and technology. Businesses are constantly seeking out new technologies and knowledge that can revolutionize their operations and enhance their competitiveness in the global market. Management teams are capitalizing on available technologies, recognizing the essential role of ICT and the internet in boosting their productivity, efficiency, and effectiveness. For businesses to thrive in this new environment, they must transform their organizational structures, reevaluate their strategies, revamp their business processes, and establish the necessary technological infrastructure to support their operations efficiently and provide a return on investment. Cloud computing is typically segmented into three categories within the service, platform, and infrastructure (SPI) model, each delivered as a service. This concept extends to the point where a software offered as a service can utilize platform or infrastructure as a base service, creating a cloud within a cloud system. Besides public and private cloud systems, hybrid cloud systems are also available. If a private cloud lacks sufficient resources, it can be expanded to a public cloud to meet the necessary requirements. This study aims to identify the optimal cloud solution by analyzing and evaluating business solutions and underlying technologies. The primary contribution of this thesis is a decision support expert system that includes a model for selecting virtualization technologies for building cloud systems.
