This doctoral thesis, apart from its introduction and general conclusions with recommendations for future research, is divided into three distinct yet interconnected sections, each providing its own conclusion. The first part (chapters 2 to 5) delves into the definitions of quality indicators, human capital, and social capital, and their interactions. Despite attempts to standardize the definition of human capital and categorize it, a global consensus remains elusive. This issue affects all major fields, including science. It has been recognized that any study of human capital is incomplete without considering social capital due to their inherent overlap. Human capital includes an individual's knowledge, skills, experience, intellect, talents, know-how, etc., while social capital is less tangible and lies in the structure of relationships among individuals. Quality indicators, on the other hand, provide qualitative and/or quantitative data on a phenomenon, enabling analysis of its evolution and checking if quality targets are met. 

The second part of the thesis introduces and clarifies concepts that have the potential to influence approaches to human and social capital management in the future. It challenges traditional views on management by incorporating theories from other domains (virtual, technical, history, nature) into the field of social complexity, offering a new paradigm based on complexity theory. This approach contributes to sustainable development and can guide strategic employee behavior alignment at the organizational level. 

The third part begins with a description of how the quality indicators model for this research was developed. It required the discovery of new data sources, as using new indicators with outdated data would not yield significant breakthroughs. The research methodology included a survey sent to Serbian scientists both at home and in the diaspora, followed by an analysis of their CVs and a wider search of their data in all publicly available sources. The research sample consisted of 444 PhDs (202 in Serbia and 242 in the diaspora). The results showed that Serbian PhDs in the diaspora published significantly more papers, had higher citation rates, and had a higher value of overall IF compared to those in Serbia. They also showed a greater inclination to collaborate with more co-authors. However, PhDs in Serbia showed a higher dedication to the interests of their wider community, greater respect for traditions and heritage, and a higher regard for succession planning. They also expressed more concern about the possibility of a societal collapse due to current consumption trends, despite scientific advancements.
