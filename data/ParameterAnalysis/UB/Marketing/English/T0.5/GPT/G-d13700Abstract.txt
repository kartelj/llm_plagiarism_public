This study aims to highlight the significance of the behavioral approach in decision-making processes within modern finance. Behavioral finance, a fairly new scientific field, explores the impact of emotional, cognitive, and social factors on financial decision-making. It is an interdisciplinary study grounded in psychology and applied to contemporary finance.

The goal is to underscore the need for the practical application of behavioral finance, which, backed by psychology, sheds light on how decision-makers make their choices. It also examines behavior in business decision-making, bridging the gap between classical finance and reality, and how financial actors make decisions, taking into account personal feelings and human limitations. Behavioral theory does not exclude emotions from human behavior, nor does it downplay the powerful influence emotions have on decision-making processes in modern finance.

Behavioral finance enhances understanding of investor behavior, managers, and events in the complex and uncertain business environment of financial markets. To assess the presence and extent of behavioral finance concepts in Serbia and Montenegro, a survey and three focus group interviews with financial managers were conducted. The focus groups aimed to create a value orientation scale for financial managers, later used in the survey to gauge the prevalence of behavioral finance concepts in our financial institutions.

Twenty-three managers from Montenegro participated in three groups, discussing manager performances, decision-making, value systems, and behavioral finance. As a result, a seven-point grading scale of manager value orientations was developed, comprising 15 values and dependent on two factors: result-oriented values and moral values.

The survey aimed to identify the decision-making styles predominantly used by financial managers and to examine the role of emotional competence and value orientations in shaping decision styles. The findings suggest that managers are not fully aware of behavioral finance theory concepts, and the insights they provide are not utilized in practice. Despite agreement on the importance of personality traits for success in this industry, professional selection is rarely implemented, and when it does occur, these traits are not assessed.

The results indicate that managers typically rely on rational decision-making, contradicting the behavioral finance theory's assertion that humans are not always rational in their decisions. It is important to note that in our environment, emotions are often disregarded, and rational reasoning is encouraged, a notion long discarded in economically advanced countries. However, the study's findings suggest that the formation of rational, intuitive, and evasive decision-making styles is influenced by emotional competence and values, partially supporting the behavioral finance theory, which emphasizes the influence of personality traits, value systems, previous experiences, emotions, attitudes, motivation, and other factors on decision-making.
