Tanja Milić's Ph.D. dissertation, titled “Strategic and Economic Aspects of Noble Organization Development with the Aim of Achieving Leading Position in Environment,” primarily focuses on examining the potential of developing a novel concept that could enhance organizational operations and secure long-term prestigious leadership positions. The author argues that this objective can be reached by creating a noble organization, an innovative model that integrates all existing concepts related to a company's primary purpose. This model is grounded on noble values concerning the company's interaction with its customers and stakeholders, and its internal operations.

The modern business environment demands the creation of new values and principles that will propel an organization to the top. Rapid scientific, technological, and societal advancements, along with faster globalization and market integration, consumer sophistication, and the abundance of goods, services, and resources, necessitate a shift in the way companies win customers and stakeholders to secure a leading position. The author asserts that successful organizations must focus on their stakeholders and implement strategies based on noble values.

The noble organization concept aims to foster stakeholder commitment, particularly consumers' loyalty to the company, ensuring sustainable profit and leadership over other companies. By focusing on spiritual, noble motives and maintaining strong relationships with key stakeholders, the organization can secure their loyalty and support. This approach will lead to high-quality, sustainable, and consistent growth and development, even during economic crises.

The dissertation explores the noble organization concept, its functionality, structure, and the impact of its noble aspects on consumer loyalty and stability. It also presents research findings on the intrinsic characteristics of companies as guidelines for further development towards achieving a noble-leading organization. Initial research focused on the influence and significance of noble business segments and values of existing companies, as well as their aspirations for a potential noble organization.

The findings revealed a strong preference for noble values and the noble organization concept among the general public. A significant number of respondents expressed positive attitudes and behaviors towards such an organization, indicating broad acceptance of a potential noble organization in the market. Examples of companies that cultivate aspects of a noble organization with excellent economic results support the rationale for introducing the noble organization concept to business systems.

The analysis suggests a high potential of noble organizations in attracting and retaining stakeholders, achieving high business performance, diminishing the influence of competitors, and improving the world. The research also found that organizations that value noble values and business aspects more are economically more successful than others. The findings highlight the need to raise awareness about the importance of these values and aspects in business organizations and provide a pathway for implementing the noble organization concept.

The dissertation provides a comprehensive examination of the noble organization concept and offers guidelines for its operation and development. It anticipates that the research will pave a new path for companies to significantly increase their revenues and profits, maintain their positions, improve their operations, and enhance the quality of life.
