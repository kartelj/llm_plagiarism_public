Cyber warfare refers to conflict in cyberspace, utilizing information communication technologies. It's a unique form of international conflict, distinct from traditional warfare in terms of means, methods and participants. Cyber warfare can occur regardless of whether a state is at war or peace. Despite similarities with criminal, espionage or terrorist activities in terms of techniques, methods and attack processes, cyber warfare is unique due to the growing prevalence and influence of information technologies on a national and global scale. 

States are increasingly allocating funds to conduct cyber warfare, developing capacities and structures for operations in cyberspace and creating doctrines and strategies for their application. Some states have even declared cyberspace the fifth domain of military activities, alongside land, sea, air, and space. The international community, however, is inclined to regulate all forms of conflict, including cyber warfare, usually through the application of existing law of armed conflict and analogy with appropriate armed conflict situations in physical space. 

Despite the wealth of literature on potential ways to apply these analogies for regulation, the practical implications and consequences of cyber attacks at an international level remain unresolved and unregulated. The difficulty lies in identifying and attributing attackers, and determining state responsibility for an attack and its consequences according to international law of armed conflict. 

Given the importance of cyber conflict and warfare in modern international relations and the expected growth of their significance alongside future development of information technologies, this dissertation aims to propose a way to regulate cyber warfare and conflict in the future. The research involved analysis of conflict threats, its dominant specifics, nature, types and content, and the applicability of traditional law to new conflict situations in cyberspace. 

The research results indicate that cyber warfare is a technologically dependent form of conflict that differs conceptually from all traditional forms of conflict in the physical environment. The key issues with international legal regulation of cyber warfare stem from the difficulty in discovering cyber attacks, identifying attackers, attributing responsibility and determining state responsibility for attacks. 

This dissertation offers a comprehensive analysis of relevant concepts and definitions, and proposes future actions for states to build capabilities for cyber defense and international legal action in regulating cyberspace conflicts. Unlike traditional conflicts, cyber warfare is a process, not a use of "cyber weapons". This process is primarily dependent on computer systems technology and information security, not military skill and practice. 

The dissertation concludes that the future of cyber warfare depends primarily on the development of information communication technologies, not on the ability of the international community to legally regulate cyberspace conflicts in a traditional way. The only possible direction for practical regulation at the international level is through the collaboration of interested parties in the international community. The solution for limiting cyber conflicts lies in the combined application of diplomatic, political, economic, military, legal, information and other efforts and activities.
