Open badges, an emerging educational technology, are used to acknowledge an individual's or group's accomplishments, skills, attributes, and interests. Recently, there has been an increase in software systems utilizing the Open Badges Infrastructure (OBI), which cater to various teaching, learning, and badging practices. However, their effectiveness can significantly differ in specific educational settings, posing a challenge for educators in selecting an appropriate system for a particular educational use. This research aims to suggest potential usability metrics, both general and OBI-specific, which could assist in choosing this educational technology. The primary outcome of this research is a methodological framework that incorporates standard general usability metrics (like the perceived usability score based on the System Usability Scale) and the newly developed technology-specific usability metrics within this research (such as the 'ease of sharing badges' score, 'badge creation satisfaction' score, etc.). This proposed method was tested in an empirical study using a mixed research method. The study's results validated the effectiveness of the suggested approach in the given context. It was demonstrated that the proposed metrics categories complement each other and have satisfactorily differentiated the systems evaluated. Furthermore, the qualitative evaluation results highlighted the major usability issues of the systems evaluated. Given the relative simplicity of collecting and interpreting the proposed metrics, the approach could be utilized in various educational environments.
