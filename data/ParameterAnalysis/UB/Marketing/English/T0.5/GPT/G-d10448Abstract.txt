Supply chain management involves planning all activities related to supply, including coordinating and collaborating with chain partners. A lack of coordination can lead to the bullwhip effect. This effect in supply chains can be caused by operational or behavioral factors. Most scholars focus on operational causes, while the importance of behavioral causes, such as personality traits, are acknowledged but not extensively studied. Despite the consensus in literature on the need for collaboration to mitigate the bullwhip effect, the role of cooperation as a personality trait has not been researched. This dissertation explores the impact of participant cooperativity on supply chain costs through a custom beer game, demonstrating how to create a supply chain with cooperative participants. Participant cooperativity was assessed using a social value orientation questionnaire. The primary hypothesis of the dissertation was validated â€“ increasing participant cooperativity can enhance supply chain function and coordination problem-solving. The study also examined the behavioral aspect of the supply chain and analyzed participant communication and interaction using transactional analysis, offering ways to boost cooperativity. Finally, the behaviors of cooperative participants that yielded positive results were established as conduct rules in the supply chain and incorporated into the simulation using Petri nets. The study confirmed that Petri nets can accommodate various factors affecting supply chains, including personality traits, suggesting that Petri net simulations could substitute real experiments.
