The objective of the doctoral thesis research is to develop the concept of integrated advertising, which is implemented by optimizing performance and yielding positive outcomes for both advertisers and target audiences. The thesis explores the impacts of various advertising tools and the potential for their integration in order to convey a consistent message that triggers positive cognitive and emotional responses from the audience. The empirical research was carried out in December 2015 at the Faculty of Organizational Sciences, involving a sample of 322 second-year students. The study was conducted in two successive stages. The first stage involved three experiments under controlled laboratory conditions where participants were exposed to specially adapted audio-visual materials featuring indirect, direct, and integrated advertising. In the second stage, participants completed printed questionnaires designed to measure their cognitive and emotional responses. Cognitive components were assessed using tests of unaided recall, aided recall, and recognition, while emotional responses were evaluated through tests measuring participants' attitudes towards different types of advertising and advertised products. The empirical research results revealed that integrated advertising holds the most promise for brand positioning in the audience's minds. Direct advertising yielded satisfactory results, albeit slightly inferior to integrated advertising, likely due to the audience's focus on the experimental material, which may not reflect a real-world scenario. The research also found that audiences have difficulty remembering brands advertised indirectly without specific reminders, suggesting that this type of advertising alone does not yield the desired outcomes. However, participants exhibited positive attitudes towards indirect advertising, making it a potentially useful tool for overcoming audience resistance that may result from overexposure to various marketing stimuli. These findings underscore the necessity of primarily planning advertising in an integrated form with synergistic messages. Considering these results, indirect advertising could take precedence over direct advertising in integrated advertising planning, given its potential to achieve numerous objectives beyond simply motivating purchases. Positioning brands in the minds of target audiences and creating a resonant effect could serve as stronger incentives for long-term investments when integrated with other marketing and corporate communication tools.
