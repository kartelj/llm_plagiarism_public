An increasing number of organizations are expanding their operations into the global market. This growth in international business and globalization has resulted in a broader internationalization of human resource management. It is now widely acknowledged that effective human resource management is crucial for the success of multinational corporations. This doctoral dissertation explores the challenges multinational corporations face when managing diverse human resources in an international context. 

The dissertation provides definitions and explanations of the fundamental issues of international human resource management, focusing primarily on staffing and performance management. Multinational corporations face various challenges when conducting business in different countries. One of the most critical decisions these corporations must make concerns the standardization of human resource management activities. 

Often, multinational corporations must modify their human resource management policies, practices, and procedures to accommodate the specific environments of the foreign countries where they operate. This dissertation aims to uncover how multinational companies handle staffing and performance management activities and the degree to which they standardize human resource management policies and practices across their headquarters and various worldwide subsidiaries. 

The dissertation reviews literature on international human resource management and presents research results focused on the standardization of human resource management practices in multinational companies. It includes empirical research carried out in subsidiaries of foreign multinational companies in Serbia, with the objective of determining the extent to which multinational companies standardize their human resource management policies and practices in their Serbian subsidiaries. 

The research also aims to identify the main factors that influence the ability to transfer these policies and practices from headquarters to foreign subsidiaries. The data analysis from the survey conducted in Serbian subsidiaries of multinational companies showed that the surveyed companies mostly standardize their human resource management policies and practices, as well as performance management practices, but not staffing practices. 

Based on these research results, the dissertation proposes a new approach to human resource management. This approach aims to help multinational companies make the best decision regarding the degree to which they want to align their human resource management policies and practices with those at headquarters, or adjust them to local Serbian practices.
