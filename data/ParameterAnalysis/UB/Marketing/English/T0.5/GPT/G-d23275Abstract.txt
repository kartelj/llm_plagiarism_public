The doctoral dissertation's focus is the creation of a national environmental management model that incorporates risk assessment methods. This model will aid in national decision-making regarding law, policy, and strategy creation, and enhance the handling of environmental risks. It will also encourage a comprehensive approach to environmental risk assessment, considering often overlooked factors like societal perception of environmental risks and varying levels of risk propensity among individuals, organizations, and other societal groups. 

The proposed model, which merges qualitative and quantitative risk assessment methods to rank environmental and ecological risks, is premised on a hybrid approach. This approach aids in decision-making by prioritizing environmental management goals. The model's implementation aims to pinpoint crucial areas in national environmental management and guide the establishment of strategic priorities for addressing environmental issues and protection. 

The model's benefits are evident in the outcomes of its application at a national level, which include environmental quality and national health improvement. This is achieved by prioritizing environmental management goals based on seven ranked environmental and ecological risks and involving the public in risk perception, assessment, and decision-making processes. Consequently, this fosters support for the creation of transparent and effective national environmental protection policies and strategies.
