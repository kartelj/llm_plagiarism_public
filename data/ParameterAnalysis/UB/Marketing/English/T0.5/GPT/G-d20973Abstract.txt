This doctoral thesis explores the further development of the methodology for constructing and assessing composite indicators, as developed by experts from the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the Joint Research Center (JRC). Composite indicators are metrics composed by weighting and aggregating individual indicators that measure various aspects of a multi-dimensional concept. These composite indicators are increasingly used by decision-makers to rank and assess entities across a range of subjects. The methodology provided by OECD-JRC offers valuable instructions for constructing the methodological framework of the composite indicator. However, the weighting method and the robustness and sensitivity analysis continue to draw interest. This thesis proposes a weighting method aimed at determining a weighting scheme that maximizes the stability of the metric, which is measured by the sum of the standard deviations of the relative contributions of indicators. The IvanoviÄ‡ distance (I-distance) is proposed to define the model constraints, while the enhanced Scatter Search (eSS) metaheuristics are used to solve the optimization problem. The new method considers the stability of the composite indicator during the process of determining the weighting scheme and suggests a data-driven weighting scheme that minimizes subjectivity and addresses the fact that robustness analysis is often overlooked in the construction and evaluation of composite indicators. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed weighting method can be effectively used in the process of constructing and evaluating composite indicators.
