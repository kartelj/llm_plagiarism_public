This thesis focuses on the enhancement of Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) through the creation of a methodological framework, which utilizes Ivanovic distance (I-distance) and resampling to establish the limits of virtual weights within the Global Assurance Region DEA model (GAR DEA). The study delves into the challenges associated with gauging the efficiency of intricate systems. It also provides a review of the most commonly employed methods for efficiency evaluation, highlighting their respective strengths and weaknesses. The concept of weight restrictions in DEA is further explained. DEA is widely recognized as the go-to method for determining the relative efficiency of complex entities, which use diverse inputs to yield various outputs. The freedom in weight determination often results in a substantial number of entities being viewed as efficient, thereby reducing the method's discriminatory power. Moreover, some entities are evaluated based on a small subset of their indicators, with other indicators being overlooked. The newly developed model addresses the shortcomings found in traditional weight restriction models, where experts' subjective evaluation determines weight limits. The I-distance allows for a data-driven, significance assessment for each indicator involved in the relative efficiency estimation. The proposed model has proven to be consistent and applicable to both profit and non-profit driven systems, as evidenced by its use in scientific papers for efficiency evaluation in the banking and health sectors. The model's successful application in two-stage DEA analysis is also demonstrated, particularly in situations where entities do not have direct control over certain indicators.
