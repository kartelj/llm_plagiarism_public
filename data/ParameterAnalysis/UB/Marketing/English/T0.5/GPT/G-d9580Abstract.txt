Upon reviewing existing literature and conducting related research, it has been determined that only a select few organizations have successfully identified and transferred project knowledge to subsequent projects. It has also been observed that project performance is closely linked to specific knowledge elements. Moreover, it is concluded that knowledge is generated through the learning process in each project and that project knowledge management must be integrated with other project management processes. The primary reasons for inefficient project management in a project environment include organizations' focus on immediate tasks rather than the learning process, insufficient analysis of project success, and the process of documenting project results. Given the lack of scientific support for utilizing project result analysis and project success results, this doctoral dissertation aims to analyze project success and investigate the impact of project success analysis results on knowledge management in a project environment. This dissertation also includes a synthesis and review of the theoretical basis for the project success analysis concept, along with empirical research leading to the development of an integrated concept for measuring and analyzing project success. The empirical research was carried out in Serbia, with a sample of organizations that prioritize project management. The research demonstrated a significant link between the methods of collecting and transferring knowledge from past projects and how we define project success and document project success results. The research findings also support the main hypothesis: Systematic project success analysis based on measuring project performances contributes to effective and efficient knowledge management in a project environment. By examining the research findings, a systematic approach to project success analysis can be developed, based on the relationship between these elements and the need for their formalization. The concept discussed here was applied in a project focusing on information systems and technologies. Furthermore, the dissertation explores the pros and cons of this concept by analyzing the aforementioned project.
