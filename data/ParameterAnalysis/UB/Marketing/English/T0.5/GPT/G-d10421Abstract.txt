As international operations become increasingly globalized, the management of intellectual capital also grows in importance. It is now widely accepted that effective intellectual capital management is crucial to an organization's success. Intellectual capital has become a vital resource and operational foundation for modern organizations. In the early 1920s, the concept of intellectual capital began to gain significance. Studying this concept can greatly increase an organization's market value compared to its book value. Unlike physical assets that depreciate with use over time, the appropriate utilization of intellectual capital can enhance an organization's value. Management is expected to identify and capitalize on opportunities and strengths, while minimizing or eliminating weaknesses in a rapidly changing environment. This approach fosters organizational growth and development. Intellectual capital has both operational and strategic significance for an organization. Nowadays, organizations are increasingly interested in managing intellectual capital. Intellectual capital, a type of intangible asset, includes human capital, structural capital, and relational capital. It encompasses not only the organization's knowledge but also the competencies of its staff, its organizational structure, business processes, intellectual property, and corporate culture. Both internal and external resources, such as relationships with customers, suppliers, distributors, and other stakeholders, are also crucial. Intellectual capital includes factors not accounted for in official financial statements, but which are vital for creating organizational value. The appropriate use of intellectual capital enhances an organization's value, with a greater emphasis on quality over quantity. Intellectual capital is a guide to future dynamic environmental changes. This thesis aims to explore how organizations identify, assess, and report intellectual capital. It includes a literature review on intellectual capital and an overview of previous studies on intellectual capital management practices in organizations. The empirical research conducted for this thesis examines the concept of intellectual capital in Serbian organizations and its importance for financial reporting. The study confirms the thesis hypothesis that intellectual capital is a leading performance indicator in the modern age, ensuring comprehensive information. The final conclusion emphasizes the need to value intellectual capital and present it in supplementary financial statements for a more accurate and reliable representation of an organization's value. The current set of financial statements and quantitative indicators do not provide sufficiently precise information, so quantified non-financial elements, or descriptive forms, can offer a clearer picture of the organization's value and potential.
