The objective of the PhD research was to ascertain the potential for creating a new or enhancing existing knowledge management models to provide a comprehensive perspective on the connections between social capital and knowledge management. This was based on previously identified theoretical insights into the main attributes of social capital in relation to knowledge management within an organization. A literature review revealed a broad range of mutual relationships and influences, forming the foundation for subsequent empirical research in the nonprofit sector, specifically within civil society organizations operating in the European Union and Western Balkans. The study not only revealed the primary features of these organizations' internal and external network operations and their knowledge management maturity level, but also confirmed all theoretical assumptions and identified certain peculiarities. A noticeable dominance of internal social capital dimensions and elements over external ones was found, suggesting that CSOs are likely more focused on the connections arising from their internal operations, specifically those made through individuals and the elements characterizing these connections found in relational, cognitive, and nodus dimensions. Consequently, external social capital, particularly structural forms through which it is established and cultivated, has not been sufficiently acknowledged and thus represents an area requiring substantial improvement. These peculiarities were also observed when social capital dimensions and elements were compared with knowledge management phases, quality, and maturity. The empirical research demonstrated that social capital elements can be incorporated into existing knowledge management models. However, due to limitations, primarily the lack of process-based nature in their functioning, project-based knowledge management models would be more practical. For this purpose, a modified Gasik model was used to illustrate how social capital can be integrated into the knowledge management process. The application of such an integrated knowledge management model was examined in the context of its practical use, potentially leading to a new paradigm of CSO operation that emphasizes knowledge as a key prerequisite for organizational competitiveness and sustainability.
