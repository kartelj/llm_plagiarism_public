The pharmaceutical sector is currently undergoing significant changes, more than ever before. This global trend is fraught with uncertainties and turbulence, with misjudgments and the implementation of strategies being common. The new millennium has introduced fresh challenges and temptations across the social, political, and economic spheres. The journey from traditional medicine production to the contemporary pharmaceutical industry has been marked by significant events in the twentieth century, including the rise of large pharmaceutical companies in the fifties, the thalidomide disaster in the sixties, new managerial strategies in the seventies, global integration and capital concentration in the nineties, and the rapid development of biotechnology in the early twenty-first century. Over the past three decades, dynamic factors have been propelling the pharmaceutical sector forward, preventing stagnation and lethargy. 

This research focuses on managing strategic changes in the pharmaceutical industry, particularly in Serbia. The analysis takes into account the current state of the industry in Serbia, the global industry's development dynamics, and the fact that strategic management and change management in this sector have not been adequately implemented. The goal is to examine the pharmaceutical sector's function and changes and establish a suitable framework for managing strategic changes in Serbia's pharmaceutical industry. 

The paper outlines the concept of strategic changes and discusses key models of strategic change management, with a special focus on Kotter's model. It also analyses the fundamental elements and features of the healthcare and pharmaceutical industry globally and in Serbia. Understanding the pharmaceutical industry necessitates knowledge of its key mechanisms and processes, such as the significance of research and development, marketing and sales, as well as expenses and financial strategies. 

The paper also explores trends and challenges in the global pharmaceutical industry that undoubtedly impact the development direction and dynamics of Serbia's pharmaceutical industry. The specific characteristics of Serbia's healthcare and pharmaceutical market are separately analysed. The country's European integration also implies significant changes in this strategically important field. 

The paper further explores potential growth and development opportunities for Serbia's pharmaceutical industry. It also includes empirical research and highlights the need for a systematic approach to improving change management in Serbia's pharmaceutical industry. Based on the findings, a strategic change management model was initiated in Serbia's pharmaceutical industry to enhance company operations and the overall efficiency of Serbia's health sector.
