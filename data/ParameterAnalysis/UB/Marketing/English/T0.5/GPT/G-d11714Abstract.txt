This doctoral thesis investigates how lean implementation can enhance the operational performance of non-repetitive manufacturing systems, specifically in terms of lead time and delivery reliability. Although there are numerous instances of operational performance improvement through lean implementation, these primarily stem from repetitive manufacturing systems, where lean was originally conceived. Current research indicates a growing interest in applying lean principles to non-repetitive manufacturing systems, but the number of successful implementations in this area is significantly less. This disparity is largely due to the lack of a structured and systematized understanding of lean implementation in non-repetitive manufacturing systems, as well as the absence of a universal framework that takes into account the unique characteristics of these manufacturing environments. 

The primary objective of this research is to enhance knowledge in the field of lean manufacturing and to evaluate the effects of lean implementation in non-repetitive manufacturing systems. This will be achieved by developing a new and original model, based on an analysis of past experiences and experimental validation within a typical non-repetitive manufacturing company. 

Existing research shows that there is an interest in lean implementation in non-repetitive manufacturing systems, however, the unique characteristics of these systems present obstacles that prevent the simple replication of lean practices from repetitive systems. This thesis reviews scientific literature to explore lean development, the characteristics of non-repetitive manufacturing systems, the potential impact of these characteristics on lean implementation, and the possibility of resolving these issues through lean implementation.

Lean was developed by Toyota for use in repetitive manufacturing systems. There are significant differences between repetitive and non-repetitive systems, primarily due to the varied needs and goals of these systems, which can significantly impact how lean is implemented. 

Based on an analysis of the potential for lean implementation in non-repetitive systems, a unique model was developed to improve operational performance. The model was designed with two main objectives. The first was to create a conceptual framework for implementing lean in non-repetitive systems, offering a new perspective and interpretation of lean principles in light of these system's characteristics. The second objective was to formalize a model for lean implementation that operationalizes these customized lean principles.

To evaluate the potential for improving lead time and delivery reliability in non-repetitive systems through lean implementation, the model was implemented and tested in a typical non-repetitive manufacturing company. The results from both simulation and empirical validation show that operational performance can be improved through lean implementation.

The key contributions of this thesis include the design of a new lean implementation model tailored specifically to non-repetitive manufacturing systems, the evaluation of this model through simulation and empirical research, a review of current lean-related research with a focus on non-repetitive systems, a critical assessment of previous research in this field, and recommendations for future research.
