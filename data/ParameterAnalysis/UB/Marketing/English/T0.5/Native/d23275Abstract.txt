The subject of the doctoral dissertation is the development of a model of environmental management at the national level by integrating risk assessment methods, which would support decision-making at the national level in the creation of laws, policies and national strategies, as well as improve the management of environmental risks at the national level. The model should also enable a holistic approach to the environmental risk assessment, taking into account sometimes previously neglected risk factors such as the perception of environmental risks by the general public, as well as the propensity for environmental risk of different participants of society, from individuals, organizations to other social groups. The environmental management model at the national level that integrates risk assessment methods presented in this dissertation is based on a hybrid approach, that is, using qualitative and quantitative risk assessment methods in ranking variable environmental and ecological risks, thereby supporting decision-making in prioritizing environmental management objectives. The purpose of the implementation of this model is to identify critical areas of environmental management at the national level and to provide directions for defining strategic priorities for solving environmental problems and environmental protection. One of the benefits of using such a model is reflected in the results of the implementation of environmental management model at a national level that relate to improving the quality of the environment and human health of a country, by setting priorities in achieving environmental management objectives based on ranked 7 environmental and ecological risks and by involving the public, not only in the process of risk perception and assessment, but also in the environmental decision-making process, thereby enhancing support for the establishment of a transparent and effective national policy and strategies for environmental protection of a country.
