: The subject of this thesis is the development of a methodological framework for the improvement of Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) by employing Ivanovic distance (I- distance) with resampling, in order to generate the bounds of virtual weights in the Global Assurance Region DEA model (GAR DEA). The dissertation examined the problems of measuring the efficiency of complex systems. In addition, overview of the most frequently used methods for efficiency evaluation and their particular advantages and disadvantages are provided. The idea of weight restrictions in DEA is elaborated. DEA is the most commonly used method for estimating the relative efficiency of complex entities using various inputs in order to produce various outputs. Freedom in determining the weights have consequences that a significant number of entities will often be perceived to be efficient, which diminishes the discriminatory power of the method. Also, some entities will be assessed only on a small subset of their indicators, while other indicators are ignored. The new model improves deficiency that occurs in classic weight restriction models, where the bounds for weights are obtained by subjective evaluation of experts. Using the I-distance, data-driven, significance assessment is obtained for each of the indicators involved in the estimation of the relative efficiency. The proposed model has shown consistency and applicability to both profit and non-profit oriented systems, which is verified by the publication of scientific papers, where new model has been utilized in efficiency evaluation of banking and health systems. It is also shown that the model can be successfully applied in the two- stage DEA analysis, in cases where indicators exist that are not under the direct control of the entity.
