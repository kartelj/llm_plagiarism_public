The development of modern information and communication technologies has enabled the expansion of teaching and learning opportunities by using new methods and tools for improving the quality of e-education. In addition, smart learning environments and Internet of things have enabled changes in teaching and learning approaches, both in traditional educational environments and in virtual community environments. The various new concepts of collective intelligence and collaborative learning are still not clearly theoretically and methodologically formed in the context of e-education and smart learning environments. Among these concepts is crowdsourcing, that uses the knowledge and skills of a crowd to perform a crowdsourcing task. Crowdsourcing has proven to be an effective innovation in learning and teaching, scientific research work and in solving various educational problems. The main hypothesis that was developed and demonstrated in this dissertation was that development and implementation of crowdsourcing models in smart learning environments improve the performance and quality of education, increase the students' motivation and improve the final results of educational process. In the experimental part of the doctoral dissertation, three research projects were carried out in two higher education institutions aimed at validating the proposed crowdsourcing models in different educational environments. The results of the evaluation confirmed the great potential of the proposed models and showed students' willingness to collaborate, their competence for solving tasks and production of quality solutions, as well as high degree of their self-organization.
