In conceptual reforms, which are expected to happen in the Republic of Serbia, during its approaching to the European Union, the reform of the health-social system will take very remarkable place. It is very obvious now that Serbia will not be able to rely exclusively on state health systems, firstly because of financial and organizational aspects, so the network of the private health institutions will certainly take very important place in the health system in Serbia. Although there is a certain number of this kind of the institution, even systems in Serbia, this sector is in progress and in the future we should expect its dynamical prosperity. Considering all of these facts, the success of development of the private health institutions will mostly depend on proper organization of marketing and sale process and prediction of challenges where those institutions will meet each other in a trade game which has just started. Definition and developmental model of inter-dependency of sale and marketing activities and their influence at development and brand position is the preferential management task for private health institutions and system. This work will tend to give some basic recommendation for their expectation, agreeable with previous experiences and scientific- research project.
