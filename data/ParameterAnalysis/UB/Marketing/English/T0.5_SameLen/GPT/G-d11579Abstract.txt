In essence, this PhD thesis, apart from the introduction and overall conclusions with suggestions for future study, consists of three distinct yet deeply interconnected and interwoven sections, each delivering its own conclusion. The first segment (chapters 2 to 5) covers definitions of quality indicators, human capital, and social capital, and an analysis of their relationships. The conceptualization of human capital is used to articulate the worth of our human abilities. Despite numerous attempts to standardize the definition and categorize human capital, none seem to have achieved a global consensus on a human capital model for all necessary measurements and computations. This issue impacts all major sectors, including science. Furthermore, it has become clear that any assessment of human capital is virtually pointless without utilizing the concept of social capital, as avoiding their overlap is impossible. Human capital includes individual's knowledge, skills, competences, experience, intellect, talents, know-how, expertise, etc., while social capital, even less tangible, resides in the structure of relationships between individuals. It can be seen as the sole form of capital that only grows when shared, originating from family connections, friendships, professional and other bonds. Lastly, quality indicators are the qualitative and/or quantitative data on a studied phenomenon, enabling analysis of its progression and verification of quality goal achievement, setting directions, and making suitable decisions and actions. Besides indicating process performances, they can also help identify areas needing more in-depth studies and investigations: They monitor changes over time, thus pointing out potential quality issues, associated with a specific stakeholder or interested party. Hence, to connect quality indicators with crucial success factors, they should always be based around the needs and expectations of the primary stakeholders and interested parties. The second segment aims to introduce and clarify notions with increasing potential to impact future approaches to human and social capital management. It questions traditional management perspectives by permitting theories from other fields (virtual, technical, history, nature) to transfer to the realm of social complexity and offer a new paradigm based on complexity theory, which provides vibrant metaphors for understanding both the world's nature and human sense-making: the worldview. This approach surpasses mere linearity and has a socially responsible nature: in the long run, it contributes to sustainable development, while at the organizational level this model could serve as a strategic alignment umbrella for employeesâ€™ behavior. In this context, throughout this section, innovative solutions are provided for various governance and management systems (environmental, HR, marketing, social responsibility, etc.) outside their direct actions to conclude how policymakers can use this paradigm shift to achieve stronger stakeholder engagement, particularly in science, education, and overall knowledge production. This process facilitated the emergence of quality indicators for the human and social capital of the scientific community. The third segment begins with a description of how the quality indicators model for this research was developed. To make this process successful, it was necessary to uncover entirely new data sources, as using new indicators with outdated data formats will not lead to a breakthrough: The new data should inform policymakers about changes in understandings, behaviors, beliefs, and attitudes. This also required a shift from aggregated, macro statistics to smaller details, tailored to the circumstances of the scientific community. The research methodology (model implementation) involved data collection in two directions: The questionnaire was sent to Serbian-origin scientists both in Homeland and Diaspora, followed by an analysis of their CVs, and a broader search of their data in all publicly accessible sources (from Google to social network profiles). The research sample included 444 PhDs (202 in Homeland and 242 in Diaspora), and it allowed all three basic hypotheses to be confirmed. Among the most significant findings are the facts that Serbian PhDs in Diaspora, compared to those in the Homeland, publish over 4 times more papers, around 6 times more papers in journals with IF, are cited above 15 times more, in 14 times more documents, have 13 times higher value of overall IF, over 5 times higher ResearchGate score, and around 5.5 times higher value of the h-index. In doing so, they are more inclined to use a strategy of more co-authors - on average, they have 4 times more coauthors than PhDs in the Homeland. Also, the study has shown that Serbian scientific Diaspora have an advantage in the ways they perceive work in science and research, the position and role of management for it, lifelong learning in the context of international mobility, and languages they speak. Along with that, Serbian PhDs worldwide also more of the opinion that people's consciousness evolves faster than ever before, due to the impact of science and technology. On the other hand, members of the scientific community in the Homeland, according to this sample, are characterized by a higher devotion to the interests of the wider community they identify with, including greater respect for traditions and heritage. PhDs in Serbia, compared with those in its Diaspora, consider "succession planning" as a more important factor in their work, are more willing to take into account the experiences of their ancestors when making vital decisions, and generally feel more afraid of the possibility that current trends of our civilization - especially regarding the level of consumption, and despite all capacities of science we have developed, may lead the entire humanity towards some form of collapse.
