The doctoral thesis titled "Brand Management Model for Establishing Long-Term Customer Relationships" presents relevant models employed by companies for successful brand and customer portfolio management, including the potential for integrating brand management and long-term customer relationship management. An overview of the thesis chapters is provided at the outset, briefly outlining the content of each. The second chapter presents the term and history of branding, with a particular focus on brand architecture and brand knowledge. This chapter also covers the brand management process, emphasizing the brand resonance model and explaining terms such as brand value, added value, and brand financial value. The third chapter focuses on relationship management, defining it and discussing CRM database and the Payne model of customer relationship management. This chapter also discusses customer relationship management models, segmentation, sub-segmentation, and categorization in CRM. The fourth chapter centers on the management of relationships between companies and customers, and the models of these relationships. The fifth chapter develops a specific brand management model for establishing long-term customer relationships, with a special focus on a branding model based on customer perspective and Suzanne Fernie's brand and customer relationship model. This chapter also discusses terms like loyalty and customer satisfaction. The sixth chapter defines points of integration between the brand management model and long-term customer relationship management, providing a detailed analysis and comparison of both concepts, with a special emphasis on the segmentation process and customer categorization, leading to the introduction of a new term, "relationship branding." The final part of the chapter presents an integral model and discusses the research results and hypothesis tests. It also provides final views on the scientific contribution of the thesis and its implications for managers, as well as potential directions for further research. The references used and the contributions of the dissertation are provided at the end of the paper.
