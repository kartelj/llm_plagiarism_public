Cyber warfare refers to conflict within the digital realm, utilizing information communication technologies. It's a distinct type of international conflict, differing from traditional warfare in terms of means, methods and participants. Cyber warfare can occur outside of war and peace periods and is not drastically technologically different from criminal, espionage or terrorist activities in its techniques, methods and attack processes. The potential of this technologically-based conflict form increases with the prevalence and influence of information technologies nationally and globally. The international practice of cyber conflict is real and dynamic. Countries allocate increasing budget funds for conducting cyber conflict, developing capacities and organizational structures for cyber operations and creating doctrines and strategies for their application and development. Some countries have declared cyberspace the fifth domain of military activities, on par with land, sea, air, and space. However, the international community naturally tends to regulate all conflicts, including cyber warfare. The natural method to do this is through the application of the existing law of armed conflict and analogy with appropriate armed conflict situations in physical space. Despite the brief period for the development of doctrines, methods and means for cyber operations, modern scientific and professional literature is rich in papers dealing with possible ways of applying said analogy for the purpose of regulating cyber warfare. A significant place in this literature belongs to the application of law based on cyber attack effects. This approach was accepted by most international legal experts, including authors of the Tallinn Manual for cyber warfare. Despite this theoretical approach, situations and consequences of conducting cyber attacks at the international level remain unresolved and unregulated in practice. States carry out operations in cyberspace, using the fact that attacks are difficult to detect until their obvious consequences are manifested; most often, it is impossible to perform identification and attribution of attackers, i.e., to practically determine a state's responsibility for an attack and its consequences in accordance with the rules, norms and principles of International law of armed conflict. Given the importance of cyber conflict and warfare in modern international relations and the expected growth of their importance in line with future development of information technologies, as well as the inability of practical regulation of situations through the application of traditional armed conflict law, the subject matter of this dissertation is the international legal regulation of conflict in cyberspace. The research objective is to determine the nature of cyber warfare and cyberspace conflict in order to propose a way to regulate it in the future. The objective was achieved during the research through the analysis of conflict threats; its dominant specifics, nature, types and content; estimate of the applicability of traditional law to new conflict situations in cyberspace, and the building of a foundation for future theoretical and practical research in the field of cyberspace conflict. Considering the limitations stemming from the technological nature of information-communication technologies and cyberspace and the fast and dynamic application of such technologies for the purpose of leading conflicts between states in cyberspace, the initial hypothesis during research was that there was no theoretic basis for long-term prediction and consequently understanding of cyber warfare nature, as well as for its international legal regulation. Given the changeable nature of cyber warfare and conflict and the need for simultaneous and complex analyses of the research matter in the context of various scientific disciplines, such as computer, legal, military and sociological sciences, as well as the existing military theory and information security practice, a multidisciplinary and partially interdisciplinary research approach was adopted. For the purpose of providing a scientific explanation of key categories, phenomena and concepts significant for research, such as cyberspace, cyber attacks, cyber weapons, cyber warfare and cyberspace conflict, a comprehensive analysis and systematization of existing knowledge, practice and experiences in the cyber conflict and warfare domain was performed. The goal of this procedure was the synthesis of the key concepts significant for understanding the nature of cyber warfare and its international legal regulation. Research results show that cyber warfare is a technologically dependent form of conflict taking place in cyberspace which is conceptually different from all traditional forms of conflict in the physical environment. Key elements of cyberspace conflict, such as conflict means (weapons), participants and methods of warfare are in their nature significantly different from situations during traditional armed conflict. Key problems of international legal regulation of cyber warfare is the frequent inability to discover cyber attacks, to perform attacker identification and attribution and determining state responsibility for attacks. These problems originate in the technological nature and therefore, cannot be efficiently resolved by exclusive legal regulation, without the application of suitable technological solutions. In some domains, such as performing cyber attacks with direct participation of people outside of public and closed computer information networks, key activities for law application cannot be practically achieved. The dissertation offers a comprehensive analysis of a large number of relevant sources of notions, definitions and concepts, based on which key characteristics of cyberspace and conflicts within cyberspace are determined. According to the analysis results, cyberspace is an environment where data and information are created, kept, processed, exchanged and destroyed by the application of computer systems characterized by the existence or possibility of establishing systems, processes and people network at the level of data. This dissertation especially covers the problems of the application of traditional International Law of Armed Conflict to conflicts in cyberspace, analyses key notions, concepts and phenomena important for cyber warfare between states and offers a proposal as a consequence of determined research results relating to future behavior of states for the purpose of building capabilities for cyber defense from cyberspace attacks and international legal action in future regulation of cyberspace conflicts. Unlike traditional conflicts in physical environment representing organized application of exclusive and specific armament, i.e., means for conduct of conflict, cyber warfare is a process, not use of "cyber weapons". This process represents intentional violation of information security of an attacked system in cyberspace for the military purposes. In general, every cyber attack process consists of the discovery of the targeted system's vulnerability, determining its nature, utilization of vulnerability for unauthorized access to the system and execution of attack. This process primarily depends on computer systems technology and information security, not military skill and practice. However, regardless of the fact that soldiers need not conduct the attack, that there is no application of specific, military armament, and that it can be conducted both during peace and war, or within or outside of a political conflict context, covertly, postponed and decentralized, cyber attacks have the potential to achieve significant military effects and goals at tactical, operational and strategic level. Considering the specific, technologically based nature of cyber warfare, it should be understood in the widest context, not as a conflict in the state of war or a military activity during military operations in the physical environment, but as a large number of possible activities taking place at the physical, logical and cognitive level of cyberspace. The logical level of cyberspace, based on logical-mathematical rules and instructions is the basis of cyberspace, connecting its influence on the living and non-living world in the physical environment through data, computer systems processing them and the meaning of information carried in those data. Wide application of information-communication technologies in cyberspace for the purpose of leading conflicts at the international level is a consequence of their increasing incidence in all segments of human life and work. Whereas the same technologies and principles of their work are applied both in peace time and military environment. This fact, not the scope and content of cyberspace conflict effects, promises the development of this type of conflict and warfare in the future and gives them the capability for fast development and changing of form, use and consequences. The goal of this dissertation is in the identification of cyber conflict and warfare nature, their sources and relations between military, international legal, social and information security practice. This goal provides the practical contribution of the dissertation, reflected in the conclusions of its research. One of the conclusions is that cyber warfare application has a future, primarily depending on the development of information communication technologies, not the capability of the international community to legally regulate cyberspace conflicts in a traditional way. Other conclusions relate to ways of cyber warfare capacity building at the national level, as well as to the only possible direction for cyber conflict practical regulation at the international level. The dissertation points out that the bases for building a national cyber defense system are not in possessing and application of technical systems for conducting operations in cyberspace, but in managing specific knowledge in the field of applied information security in cyberspace at the national level. Also, it is determined that international legal regulation of cyber warfare is not possible through exclusive application of traditional International Law of Armed Conflict, not even through building of new legal systems, if they are based only on traditional legal solutions, without simultaneous inclusion and application of technological solutions on the basic level of modern information communication technologies. The conclusion of the analysis is that the development of new technologies will quickly bring about the development of new cyber warfare capabilities. The dissertation offers a conclusion that the only way of practical cyber warfare regulation at the international level, and at the same time limitation of its negative consequences, is contained in the possible bilateral and multilateral collaboration of interested parties in the international community. Conflicts in cyberspace do not take place only during the state of war, and not only through the application of military offensive operations, so the solution for their regulation cannot be found exclusively in International Law of Armed Conflict, but be a part of a comprehensive approach encompassing many possibilities and activities of military and peacetime exercise of national power. The solution for limiting cyber conflicts lies in the combined application of diplomatic, political, economic, military, legal, information and other efforts and activities.
