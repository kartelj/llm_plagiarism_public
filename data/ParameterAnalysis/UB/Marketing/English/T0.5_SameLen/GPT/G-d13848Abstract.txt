Creating new products and services can rejuvenate existing industries and establish entirely new ones. Thus, the development and commercialization of new technologies are vital to the global economy. In this context, entrepreneurship is seen as a catalyst for economic and social growth, through the formation of new businesses, concepts, products, and services. Recently, social entrepreneurship has garnered the attention of many scholars and practitioners who recognize the importance of entrepreneurial development in not only creating employment and new job opportunities, but also in fostering a healthy societal environment. Technological entrepreneurship begins with assessing the market value of new discoveries and technologies and aligning them with current or potential market needs, with the goal of converting market opportunities into commercialized products, services or new ventures. In this process, individuals who form teams to develop technological new ventures play a crucial role. This organizational form is commonly referred to as a “technological startup” or simply “startup”, and is defined as a temporary organization established to discover a sustainable and scalable business model. Startups also encompass early-stage ventures in innovative and cutting-edge technology fields, characterized by high dynamism, growth orientation, profitability, and the creation of new market values. Many entrepreneurs who develop new, technologically-based products and services within their own startups possess extensive technological knowledge and skills. However, due to their focus on technology and new product or service development, technological venture founders often neglect business orientation, which frequently leads to failure. This dissertation examines marketing and marketing orientation as part of business orientation in the development of technological entrepreneurial ventures. The objective of this dissertation is to develop a comprehensive model of the influence of marketing orientation on the success of technological entrepreneurial ventures in the startup development phase. Marketing orientation is defined as an organizational culture that efficiently fosters organizational behavior and simultaneously creates superior customer value, which is seen as a prerequisite for successful business. The effect of marketing orientation on the development of technological startups is analyzed in this dissertation through competition orientation, customer orientation, and interfunctional coordination. In addition to marketing orientation, the concept of entrepreneurial marketing is examined, analyzed through the components of entrepreneurial orientation: innovation, proactivity, risk-taking, autonomy, and competitive aggressiveness. This dissertation also includes an analysis and research on environmental impact, competitiveness level, and the role of mentorship in the development of technological startups. Additionally, the personal traits of successful entrepreneurs are analyzed. Measuring the performance of technological startups, unlike established companies with business history and large corporations, deviates from traditional success measurement methods, posing a significant challenge for both theory and practice. Based on a review of existing academic literature and qualitative research conducted within a specific target audience, 13 developmental goals for technological startups have been identified. In the quantitative research, the reduction of this scale’s dimensions using the principal component method resulted in four success factors for the development process: success of idea and concept, success of value proposition, success of value exchange, and success of business model. The results of the quantitative research conducted and presented in this dissertation underscore the significant role and influence of various marketing and entrepreneurial orientation components on the success of the development process of technological startups. Moreover, the results elucidate the impact of environmental competitiveness and mentorship on the success of the development process. The final part of the research identifies the personal characteristics of successful founders of technological startups.
