The globalization of international operations has made intellectual capital management increasingly crucial. There's a prevailing belief today that effective management of intellectual capital is a cornerstone of organizational success. Intellectual capital is now a key resource and operational base for modern organizations. During the early 1920s, the concept of intellectual capital grew in significance. Studying this concept significantly boosts an organization's market value compared to its book value. Unlike physical assets that depreciate with use, appropriate utilization of intellectual capital enhances an organization's value. Management is tasked with identifying and leveraging opportunities and strengths in the face of drastic environmental changes while minimizing or eliminating weaknesses. This approach fosters organizational growth and development. Intellectual capital holds both operational and strategic importance for organizations. Increasingly, organizations are showing interest in managing intellectual capital. Intellectual capital, a form of intangible assets, consists of human, structural, and relational capital. It includes not just the organization's knowledge but also staff competencies, organizational structure, business processes, intellectual property, and corporate culture. Both internal and external resources (relationships with customers, suppliers, distributors, and other stakeholders) are crucial. Intellectual capital comprises factors not reflected in official financial statements but are vital for organizational value creation. Proper use of intellectual capital boosts organizational value. Its qualitative dimension is more important than the quantitative, as it creates added value. Intellectual capital serves as a future guide amid dynamic environmental changes. This thesis aims to explore how organizations identify, evaluate, and report intellectual capital. It reviews relevant literature on intellectual capital and previous studies on intellectual capital management practices in organizations. The empirical research within the thesis discusses the concept of intellectual capital in Serbian organizations and its importance for financial reporting. The study verifies the thesis hypothesis that presenting an accurate intellectual capital position is a leading performance indicator in the modern age, aiming to ensure information completeness. The final conclusion underscores the need for intellectual capital valuation and its inclusion in additional financial statements to accurately reflect the organization's value. The current set of financial statements and quantitative indicators lack the precision needed to present necessary information. Therefore, quantified non-financial elements or descriptive forms can provide a clearer picture of the organization's value and potential.
