The purpose of this study is to broaden understanding of quality cost in current operations, and discern the necessity of establishing a quality cost model within a process-systemic perspective. The study, conducted on 186 companies from various sectors, is detailed in this paper. Only firms knowledgeable about quality costs were chosen for the study. The research's business database was compiled based on three indicators of the firms' familiarity with quality costs. The findings reveal a high awareness of the significance of quality costs, and a growth in the number of firms managing these costs. Influential factors in quality cost management systems were highlighted, and relationships between variables that define these systems were examined. Furthermore, the requirements of ISO 9001:2015 standard that have a statistically significant correlation with the variables defining quality cost management were chosen based on the firms' view of their importance. Considering the study's findings indicate a need for a quality cost model within a process-systemic perspective, the PAF model is employed in this paper at the process level to suggest a quality cost model where quality cost elements are evaluated in relation to process outputs, and the principle that one process's outputs influence the quality of another process is considered. In the model, quality costs are calculated for each process at two stages: present (prior to measures) and future (post measures). Necessary control or improvement actions are taken based on nonconformity cause analysis and according to the PAF model's assumption that preventive and appraisal activities decrease failure costs and total quality costs. In the model, the discrepancy between total quality costs in the two observed stages is viewed as the maximum potential quality cost reduction for the observed process. This value is used to prioritize processes for implementing defined control or improvement measures, based on the PAF model's assumption that higher costs indicate lower quality and thus higher priority for such actions.
