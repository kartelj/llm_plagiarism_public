The doctoral thesis primarily focuses on the field of the information society, its evolution, and mechanisms for monitoring and measuring its progress. It encapsulates existing research and theories on the subject of the information society, its various forms, factors influencing its growth, and numerous international initiatives aimed at guiding its global advancement. The thesis explores ways to quantify the complex concept of the information society using a set of interrelated indicators, researching the most suitable metrics for observing, measuring, and evaluating its current state. Besides providing a classification and evolutionary path of benchmarking indicators, the cornerstone of any methodology for quantifying the information society, the thesis also includes an overview of the most relevant methodologies used globally to evaluate the information society. However, the main emphasis of this work is the creation of a unique model specifying the necessary actions to track and evaluate Serbia's information society's progress. This model assumes a theoretical foundation, compatibility with EU standards for international cross-country analyses and comparisons, and compliance with the specificities of Serbia's information society and its potential for investment and further development. The model's formulation includes selecting a set of Information Society Indicators (ISI) in line with EU standards but modified to suit Serbia's characteristics and development potential, transforming the ISI set for ranking based on significance for monitoring the information society, extracting the most relevant ISI subset, and defining a sub-model that quantifies the digital divide's degree through a unique compound indicator - the Digital Polarization Index (DPI). The model has been validated using Serbia as a case study, monitoring and analyzing its information society over five years. The verification process involved statistical monitoring, quantification, and relevant data analysis, and analyzing the results to determine the current state, identify and quantify 'critical points' in Serbia's information society development, and forecast its future progress. The thesis's professional contribution is the evaluation of Serbia's information society development from both the population and economic perspectives. Moreover, the thesis contributes by quantifying and evaluating the intensity of the digital divide and its trends, and identifying the most digitally underdeveloped groups within Serbia's population. The primary scientific contribution is the creation of a model for monitoring and evaluating the information society's development. This model relies on the I-distance method and cluster analysis, two appropriately combined multivariate analysis methods. The initial set of indicators has been narrowed down to the most relevant ones after ranking them based on their I-distance value and applying cluster analysis. The resulting subset includes the most significant indicators for assessing the information society based on 'information quantity.' By reducing the number of indicators while retaining valuable information content, the model's practical application has been significantly enhanced. Additionally, the thesis defines a model for quantifying individual and total digital divide in various areas by introducing the digital polarization index. This model's main characteristics are its generality, flexibility, and openness for adding or changing its basic components, allowing for the identification, definition, and calculation of various individual sub-indices of digital polarization used in calculating the total DPI. These model features are valuable given the rapid changes in the ICT sector. The thesis's social contribution lies in its potential application in monitoring and quantifying the information society and guiding and harmonizing its development. The formulated model can serve as a strategic decision support tool and a tool for observing and minimizing the digital divide. It can also support the evaluation of complex social phenomena outside the information society framework.
