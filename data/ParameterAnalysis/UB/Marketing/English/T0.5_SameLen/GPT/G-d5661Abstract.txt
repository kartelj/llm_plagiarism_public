This doctoral thesis aims to elucidate the significance of special events domestically and internationally. Since antiquity, gatherings have been organized for different reasons. These events were perceived as unique and extraordinary experiences. They were infrequent, occurring due to specific circumstances, individual requests, or governmental group demands. Consequently, they incited thrill and uniqueness. The leisure and entertainment sector is currently a primary focus. Over the recent years, it has seen rapid growth and now holds a distinctive position in the service market, producing numerous innovative service delivery methods. Worldwide, agencies specializing in event planning are highly sought after and hold a considerable stake in business achievement, profit, and positive customer feedback in the service industry, at a global scale. Conversely, every manager must engage in decision making during their work hours. Decisions are constantly being made, not only in relation to traditional managerial functions but also in the organization of special events. Decision making is not an isolated managerial task, but rather a shared element of all other functions. Managers at all organizational levels participate in various decisions, from operational and tactical to strategic. This thesis will illustrate how utilizing a group decision-making system can enhance the organization of special events.
