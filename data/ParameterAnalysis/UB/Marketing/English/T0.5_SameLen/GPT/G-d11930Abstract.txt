Tanja Milić's Ph.D. dissertation, “Strategic and Economic Aspects of Noble Organization Development with the Aim of Achieving Leading Position in Environment”, explores the potential for a new business concept that could enhance organizational performance and achieve long-term sustainable leadership. The author suggests that this can be accomplished through the development of the noble organization concept, an innovative model for attaining, nurturing, and maintaining leadership. This model integrates all known concepts related to the primary purpose of businesses, based on new noble values in relation to customers and stakeholders, and the company itself. The demands of the modern business environment require the creation of new values and principles that will propel the organization to the top. The rapid pace of scientific, technological, and social advancement, coupled with increased globalization, market integration, consumer sophistication, and the abundance of goods, services, and resources, as well as the significant changes in the business and living environment in the 21st century, necessitate alternative strategies for attracting customers and stakeholders to achieve leadership. The author argues that successful organizations must focus on their stakeholders, implementing strategies based on noble values. The noble organization concept aims to secure stakeholder commitment, particularly consumer loyalty, ensuring long-term sustainable profits and leadership over other companies. Spiritual, noble motives and approaches towards major stakeholders will help them to disregard other companies and align themselves with the noble organization. This concept will facilitate the realization of desired goals, resulting in high-quality, sustainable, stable, and consistent profits and growth for the organization. Even during economic crises, the noble organization will be better positioned than others, as it will maintain consumer commitment and support. The dissertation describes the noble organization, its concept, function, and construction, and presents research results related to consumer responses to certain noble aspects of the company and how these aspects influence their loyalty to the company. The study also presents results related to the inherent characteristics of companies as guidelines for further development towards becoming a noble, leading organization. Initial research focused on examining the impact and importance of certain noble business segments of existing companies and values, and their aspirations for a potential noble organization. The research results showed a high preference for noble values and the concept of the noble organization among the general public. A significant percentage of respondents expressed positive attitudes and behaviors towards such an organization, indicating broad acceptance of a potential noble organization. The dissertation also presents examples of companies that foster individual aspects of noble organization with excellent economic results, justifying the development and introduction of the noble organization concept to business systems. The results of the descriptive statistics analysis indicate a high potential power of noble organization in attracting and retaining stakeholders, achieving high business performance, reducing the influence and importance of its competitors, and improving the world in which we live. The research results also show that organizations that value noble values and business aspects more are more successful economically than other organizations. The dissertation explores the concept from all aspects of the organization, and provides the final image of the noble organization with instructions for its operation and development. The author expects that this dissertation will pave a new path for companies to follow, leading to a significant increase in their inflows and profits, as well as maintaining the stability of their acquired positions, their improvements, and improving the quality of life itself.
