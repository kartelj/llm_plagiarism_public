The mining industry's ongoing requirement for progressive strategies and more efficient, dependable, and safer operational methods throughout the production process, from conception to final termination, promotes collaboration between the mining industry and research, academia, technological equipment, technology, labor organization, norm establishment, and standardization. Mining production outcomes are not solely reliant on environmental conditions, workforce expertise, technical and technological equipment, industrial-economic and social-political environments. They significantly hinge on the efficiency of supervisory and management structures, or mining management. This understanding guided the selection and clarification of the doctoral dissertation's topic presented here, focusing on examining the impact of international standards on Serbia's mining industry. The research aims to analyze global and national advancements in this area, explore the philosophy of management systems and international standards worldwide and nationally, and assess the adaptability and adequacy of management systems based on international standards when applied in the diverse conditions of the mining industry. Our research validates the initial hypothesis that international standards are insufficient for effective mining system management. Consequently, we propose a structural model incorporating international standards, which suitably addresses mining management needs and targets the goals of extraction, safety, production, and environmental protection. The issues discussed in the doctoral dissertation are both significant and pressing. The dissertation holds scientific and practical value for the mining industry, evidenced by the research producing results in both areas.
