Numerous research over the past two decades indicates that despite the implementation of quality models, health care organizations continue to experience nonconformities and errors, resulting in persistently low quality. The applied quality models vary, even though they all adhere to the same standard, regulation or concept, leading to differing outcomes. The variation in model structure and results can be attributed to the process of translating guidelines into the implemented model for quality assurance or improvement, often neglecting non-clinical processes that contribute to the quality of health care organizations. Information about the quality of different physicians or health care organizations and the outcomes of various treatment or diagnosis methods, which are crucial for patients' selection of a particular health care organization, physician, or treatment method, are often unavailable, inadequate or not presented in a decision-friendly format. There is limited information available to patients about the quality or outcome of different treatments or providers. Health care quality reports primarily support the choice of health plans and quality improvement among plans and providers, rather than patient awareness and choice. Consequently, high-quality health care organizations are not rewarded with more patient selection for their services, and patients lack clear information to make choices based on their priorities. The aforementioned points highlight two main issues in achieving quality in health care organizations and reaping the benefits of quality achievement. The first issue stems from the transformation of general standards, guidelines, and regulations into a specific model for a particular health care organization, which usually overlooks non-health care processes. The second issue arises from reporting achieved quality, where an overload of data on parameters hinders patients' decision-making about the choice of health care organization, and a variety of data types complicates comparisons between organizations. Viewing health care organization as a business system through the Anatomical Structure Model developed at the Faculty of Organizational Science enables the identification of all elements that directly or indirectly affect the quality of health care services and the structuring of the health care organization. This perspective results in a Model for Quality Improvement of Health Care Business Systems, which serves as a bridge between certain policies, standards, guidelines or concepts, and a specific model for quality assurance, control, and management of health care organizations. The model includes graphical, verbal, and mathematical components, enabling the computation of the quality of each element of the health care business system and facilitating quality comparison between health care business systems using this model, or their similar component elements. The model's application in two primary health care business systems demonstrated its positive impact on quality improvement.
