Stochastic programming, a segment of operational research, explores methods to integrate uncertainty into decision-making processes, acknowledging that complete information may not always be readily accessible to the decision maker. The primary challenge in implementing stochastic programming arises from the uncertainty of parameters in the model and the fact that the optimal solution is determined for the deterministic equivalent (double) of the initial problem. Another issue is assessing the quality of a specific deterministic equivalent from the standpoint of the criterion function value, which could be random, and from the probability of satisfying stochastic constraints. Stochastic programming finds application in various sectors, with some of the most frequent problems addressed using stochastic programming being in production planning, supply chains, logistics, transportation, portfolio management, marketing, finance, and other fields. Three common strategies for resolving stochastic programming problems are stochastic optimization, robust optimization, and chance constrained programming, which form the foundation of all research in this optimization field. Robust optimization is a conservative method that focuses on the worst-case scenario by establishing a deterministic equivalent of the initial problem that eliminates all model uncertainty. Chance constrained programming is a technique that manages uncertainty in the model's constraint parameters and employs various methods to solve these problems. The fundamental assumption in this approach is that a certain constraint, which is stochastic and uncertain, must be met with a predetermined probability. The need to define the constraints in such a way that the predetermined probability of meeting constraints is essentially a risk that the solution obtained will not be fulfilled and which the decision maker is prepared to accept is the reason for developing and applying such an approach. The most difficult and significant aspect of the chance constraint 7 approach is tractability, primarily related to the ability to identify the appropriate probability distributions of the stochastic parameters. However, all the aforementioned stochastic programming approaches are complementary methods for solving optimization problems with uncertainty, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. The research topic of this dissertation is the investigation of different approaches to handling uncertainty in mathematical models, i.e., the development of a new method for solving stochastic programming models. The dissertation's basic premise is that the real-world problem of stochastic programming can be effectively solved using a combination of classic deterministic optimization and simulation. The research's objective is to contribute to the field of stochastic programming by developing a new method for solving weakly structured problems. More specifically, the dissertation proposes a new original method: the iterative optimization-simulation approach. This approach consists of two stages: an optimization phase in which the deterministic equivalent of the initial problem is solved to optimality, and a simulation phase in which the probability of meeting constraints is verified using simulation. Each deterministic equivalent represents a new scenario, which is verified using simulation power. If the decision maker is not satisfied with the outcome, a new scenario of the original stochastic problem with new deterministic values will be established. The accumulated experience from checking scenarios is used to consider and formulate heuristics as simple rules for scenario generation. The primary objective of the research is to use the optimal solutions obtained through the implementation of this approach to solving stochastic models as sound managerial decisions that will facilitate the achievement of goals and the implementation of stochastic models in real-world problems. The most significant contribution of this dissertation is the definition of a new method for solving stochastic optimization problems, i.e., the creation of an efficient method for solving stochastic models using a simulation approach. In addition to this, we will propose a new scenario in 8 solving stochastic optimization models that will facilitate a much simpler application of the appropriate algorithms in solving these models and implementing them in the real world.
