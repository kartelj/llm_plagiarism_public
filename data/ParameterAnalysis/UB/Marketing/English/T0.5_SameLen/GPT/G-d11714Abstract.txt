This doctoral thesis explores how operational performance in non-repetitive manufacturing systems - specifically lead time and delivery reliability - can be enhanced through lean implementation. Many examples of operational performance improvement via lean implementation exist, predominantly from repetitive manufacturing systems where lean was originally developed. Current research indicates a growing interest in applying lean to non-repetitive manufacturing systems. However, cases of operational performance improvement in non-repetitive manufacturing systems are notably fewer than those from repetitive manufacturing systems. One significant reason for this is that lean implementation knowledge in non-repetitive manufacturing systems is not as organized and systematized as in repetitive manufacturing systems. Furthermore, there is no standardized framework for implementing lean in non-repetitive manufacturing systems that considers all specific manufacturing environment characteristics and all lean characteristics. The primary objective of this research is to enhance knowledge in lean manufacturing and to examine the impact of lean implementation in non-repetitive manufacturing systems by developing a unique and innovative model of lean implementation for non-repetitive manufacturing systems. This will be based on prior experience analysis and experimental validation of the proposed model in a typical non-repetitive manufacturing company. Analysis and systematization of prior lean implementation research in non-repetitive manufacturing systems reveal that there is interest in lean implementation in non-repetitive manufacturing systems, but challenges exist due to non-repetitive manufacturing systems characteristics that prevent lean implementation practices in repetitive manufacturing systems from being directly replicated in non-repetitive manufacturing systems. To examine the feasibility of lean implementation in non-repetitive manufacturing systems, this doctoral thesis reviews scientific literature for information on lean development, non-repetitive manufacturing systems characteristics, potential implications of those characteristics on lean implementation, and potential solutions to non-repetitive manufacturing systems problems through lean implementation. Lean was developed in Toyota, a manufacturing system identified as repetitive. There are substantial differences in characteristics of repetitive and non-repetitive manufacturing systems, primarily due to diverse needs met by the two types of manufacturing systems, and consequently by different objectives and activities pursued to achieve those objectives. These differences in characteristics can significantly affect how lean is implemented in non-repetitive manufacturing systems. Lean implementation is typically aligned with repetitive manufacturing systems characteristics, so it is necessary to develop a custom approach to accommodate a specific manufacturing environment's characteristics. Based on the analysis of lean implementation possibilities in non-repetitive manufacturing systems, a unique lean implementation model for enhancing operational performance in non-repetitive manufacturing systems was developed. The model design followed two paths. The first path was to develop a conceptual framework for implementing lean in non-repetitive manufacturing systems, with the primary objective being to provide a new overview and interpretation of lean principles in the context of non-repetitive manufacturing systems characteristics, and to examine the feasibility of using customized lean principles to actively shape the non-repetitive manufacturing environment. The second path stems from the first and represents the formalization of a model for lean implementation in non-repetitive manufacturing systems. The model itself operationalizes customized lean principles and suggests a method of applying lean principles in non-repetitive manufacturing systems through a series of steps aimed at enhancing operational performance. To examine the feasibility of enhancing lead time and delivery reliability in non-repetitive manufacturing systems through lean implementation, the model was implemented in a typical non-repetitive manufacturing system company. The feasibility was initially tested through simulation, with the results indicating that model implementation can enhance lead time and delivery reliability. This was followed by empirical validation through actual model implementation in the company. The empirical validation results indicate that the operational performance of non-repetitive manufacturing systems, specifically lead time and delivery reliability, can be enhanced through lean implementation. This doctoral thesis's contribution is reflected in several key outcomes: (1) a new lean implementation model, custom-made to non-repetitive manufacturing systems characteristics, was developed; (2) the feasibility of the lean implementation model for enhancing operational performance in non-repetitive manufacturing systems was evaluated through simulation and empirical research; (3) the proposed model was assessed based on the evaluation of simulation and empirical research outcomes; (4) the current state of lean-related research was reviewed, with particular focus on lean implementation in non-repetitive manufacturing systems; (5) prior research in the field of lean implementation in non-repetitive manufacturing was critically evaluated; (6) recommendations for future research were provided.
