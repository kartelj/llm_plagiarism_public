The successful completion of the transition process in Central and Eastern Europe, including Serbia, requires the privatization of state and socially owned enterprises. Prior to privatization, these enterprises need to be restructured, as experience has shown. Various restructuring activities aim to enhance company performance, efficiency, and shareholder value. This dissertation focuses on a restructuring methodology based on key value drivers. It also discusses the definition of value, value creation measurement, and value creation models. The goal is to help management understand how to create value through restructuring activities and decisions related to operations, financing, and investments. To create value, management must adopt strategies that increase the return on invested capital, reduce risk, or combine both approaches. The success of restructuring is gauged by the amount of value created, i.e., the difference in equity value before and after restructuring. A company's equity value equals the present value of its discounted future cash flows and depends on both future cash flows and the weighted average cost of capital. Therefore, to increase equity value, it is necessary to boost cash flows by increasing revenue, reducing costs, and improving asset turnover, and also to decrease business risk and the cost of capital. The appropriate sale method of equity can affect the realized equity price of companies undergoing restructuring when their equity is offered for sale to strategic and financial investors. This paper analyzes public tenders and public auctions as equity sale methods for socially and state-owned enterprises undergoing restructuring and privatization. The research and analyses presented in this dissertation support the hypothesis that company restructuring can increase their value and ready them for sale to potential investors. The restructuring methodology presented in this dissertation also suggests that it is possible to develop a restructuring model based on key value drivers that can be applied to any company. Lastly, the analysis of privatization results in Serbia confirms that the sale model of socially and state-owned enterprises is the most efficient privatization model in the late transition stage.
