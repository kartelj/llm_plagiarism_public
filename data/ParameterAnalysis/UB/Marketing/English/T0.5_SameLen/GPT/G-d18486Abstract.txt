The PhD thesis "Strategizing Marketing Communication in Cultural-Educational Establishments for Children" compiles theoretical knowledge based on prior research on marketing communication strategies in cultural and educational institutions for children. It also includes practical knowledge gained over many years working in a children's cultural institution established by the City of Belgrade and numerous cultural projects for children and youth. The research aims to achieve equal treatment of children's cultural-educational institutions with other cultural establishments for older demographics, considering the lack of comprehensive literature on this issue. The thesis addresses the problem of insufficient market awareness in children's cultural institutions, which directly endangers the institution's survival and future growth. The research utilized interviews, focus groups, surveys, and case studies, and analyzed both public and private child-focused institutions and organizations in Serbia and the surrounding region, compared to similar institutions outside the region. The paper scrutinizes the challenges of implementing marketing communication strategies and public relations and illustrates how children's institutions strategize and execute marketing communication. It provides successful real-world examples for a thorough comparison. The paper examines the uniqueness of marketing communication in the culture and education sector and the relationship between non-profit marketing and public relations, which is essential in non-profit cultural and educational activities. Children's cultural institutions must secure a competitive position, retain existing patrons, attract potential audiences, and stimulate cultural interest in the so-called non-existent audience. The development of cultural-educational institutions is hindered by insufficient audience numbers. By utilizing integrated marketing communications and public relations, cultural and educational institutions for children can collaborate with schools to foster children's cultural needs, cultivate cultural habits, and promote healthier adulthood. Theoretical and empirical studies validate the paper's primary hypothesis: the successful market positioning of children's cultural and educational institutions requires the consistent implementation of marketing communication strategies. It has been determined that marketing is crucial in the culture and education sector in its broadest sense. Despite significant differences between the profit and non-profit sectors, fundamental marketing concepts can be applied to both, such as providing services/products that the user/customer desires and mutually advantageous exchange.
