The construction sector is vast and intricate. Given that contractors carry out a significant amount of construction work, the success of these projects largely depends on their skills and credentials. Consequently, choosing a qualified contractor is a crucial task that requires a critical decision for each project. To effectively accomplish this, it is advisable to implement a prequalification process to assess their suitability before reaching the bid awarding stage where the final selection decision is made. As this issue embodies a typical multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problem, the AHP method was utilized. The purpose of this thesis is to suggest a model to assist the Libyan Central Committee of Tendering (hereafter referred to as the Committee) in prequalifying prospective contractor candidates. The model was tested on four Serbian construction companies and comprises four criteria, namely, experience, technical capability, managerial capability, and human capability. A sensitivity analysis was performed to verify the model's robustness. We conclude that the suggested model can provide a dependable framework for the Libyan Central Committee of Tendering when making such a prioritization decision. Furthermore, we can assert that the suggested model would operate effectively, producing satisfactory results, and succeed in making rational decisions in the construction contractor prequalification process, which undoubtedly improves the integrity and transparency of bid awarding processes in the nation.
