In the fast-paced and competitive business landscape, corporations and their leaders are compelled to quickly adjust to market shifts and concentrate on identifying methods to generate new value and optimize knowledge and technology investment returns. They are exploring technologies and knowledge that will revolutionize their business operations and enhance their global market competitiveness. Leaders are striving to utilize available potential technologies, recognizing the necessity of integrating ICT and the internet into their operations to boost productivity, efficiency, and effectiveness. If businesses want to thrive in this new environment, they need to transform their organizational structures, rethink their strategies and business processes, establish the necessary technology infrastructure to efficiently support business processes and yield investment returns. Cloud computing is typically segmented into three categories within the service, platform, and infrastructure (SPI) model, each delivered as a service. This idea extends to the point where a software-as-a-service provider can use platform or infrastructure as a base service. This is a multi-layered cloud system. In addition to public and private cloud systems, hybrid cloud systems also exist. If resources in the private cloud are insufficient, expansion to the public cloud is possible to meet the resource needs. This study aims to identify the optimal cloud solution and conducts an analysis and evaluation of business solutions and underlying technologies. The primary contribution of this dissertation is a decision support expert system that includes a model for selecting virtualization technologies for cloud system construction.
