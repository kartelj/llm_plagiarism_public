Modern information and communication technologies have facilitated the growth of teaching and learning possibilities through the use of innovative methods and tools to enhance e-education quality. Furthermore, smart learning environments and the Internet of things have initiated changes in teaching and learning strategies, in both conventional and virtual community settings. The multiple new notions of collective intelligence and cooperative learning remain somewhat undefined both theoretically and methodologically within the sphere of e-education and smart learning environments. One such concept is crowdsourcing, which leverages the expertise and abilities of a group to complete a task. Crowdsourcing has been shown to be a successful innovation in education and research, and in addressing various educational challenges. The primary hypothesis established and validated in this dissertation was that the creation and application of crowdsourcing models in smart learning environments enhance educational performance and quality, boost student motivation, and improve the overall outcomes of the educational process. In the experimental segment of the doctoral dissertation, three research projects were conducted in two higher education institutions to test the suggested crowdsourcing models in diverse educational settings. The evaluation results affirmed the significant potential of the proposed models, demonstrated students' readiness to cooperate, their capability to solve tasks and generate quality solutions, and their high level of self-organization.
