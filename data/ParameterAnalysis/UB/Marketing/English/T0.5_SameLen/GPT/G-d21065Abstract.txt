This dissertation focuses on enhancing Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) through the creation of a methodological framework that incorporates Ivanovic distance (I-distance) and resampling to establish virtual weight boundaries in the Global Assurance Region DEA model (GAR DEA). The study delves into the challenges of gauging the efficiency of intricate systems. It also provides a comprehensive review of the most commonly used efficiency assessment methods, highlighting their specific pros and cons. The concept of weight restrictions in DEA is discussed in detail. DEA is the primary method for assessing the relative efficiency of complex entities, utilizing various inputs to yield different outputs. The liberty in weight determination often results in a significant number of entities being deemed efficient, thereby reducing the method's discriminatory power. Moreover, some entities are evaluated based on a limited set of indicators, while others are overlooked. The proposed model addresses the shortcomings of traditional weight restriction models, where weight boundaries are determined based on expert opinion. By employing the I-distance, a data-driven significance evaluation is achieved for each indicator involved in the relative efficiency estimation. The model has demonstrated consistency and applicability in both for-profit and not-for-profit systems, as evidenced by its use in scientific papers evaluating the efficiency of banking and healthcare systems. The model's successful application in two-stage DEA analysis, particularly in scenarios where uncontrollable indicators are present, is also demonstrated.
