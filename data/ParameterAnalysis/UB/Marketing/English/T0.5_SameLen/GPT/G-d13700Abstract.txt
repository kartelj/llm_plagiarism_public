'This study aims to highlight the significance of the behavioral approach in contemporary finance decision-making processes. Behavioral finance, a relatively new field, examines the impact of emotional, cognitive, and social factors on financial decision-making. It is an interdisciplinary study, grounded in psychology and applied to modern finance. The goal is to underscore the need for practical application of behavioral finance, which, backed by psychology, elucidates how decision-makers make their choices. It also scrutinizes behavior in business decision-making, connecting traditional finance with reality and the methods financial actors use in decision-making, including all inherent human emotions and limitations. Behavioral theory does not exclude or undervalue the powerful influence of emotions in contemporary finance decision-making processes. Behavioral finance offers improved comprehension of investor behavior, managers, and events in complex, uncertain financial market environments. To investigate the prevalence of behavioral finance concepts in Serbia and Montenegro, a survey and three focus group interviews with financial managers were conducted. The focus groups aimed to create a value orientation scale for financial managers, later used in the survey to gauge the prevalence of behavioral finance concepts in our financial institutions' practices. Twenty-three managers from Montenegro participated in three groups, discussing manager performances, decision-making, value systems, and behavioral finance. The discussions resulted in a seven-point grading scale of manager value orientations, comprising 15 values and hinging on two factors: result-oriented values and moral values. The survey research sought to identify the decision-making styles predominantly used by financial managers and assess the role of emotional competence and value orientations in decision style formation. Based on the research and focus group findings, it can be concluded that managers are not fully aware of behavioral finance theory concepts and that these theories' insights are not applied in practice. Despite agreement on the importance of personality traits for success in this business, professional employment selection is rare. When it does occur, these traits are not verified. The results indicate that managers typically rely on rational decision-making, contradicting behavioral finance theory's claim that humans are not always rational decision-makers. It's important to remember that in our environment, emotions are generally disregarded, and rational reasoning is favored â€“ a notion long since discarded in economically advanced countries. However, the research findings demonstrate that the formation of rational, intuitive, and evasive decision-making styles depends on emotional competence and values, partially validating behavioral finance theory's assertion that factors like personality traits, value system, past experience, emotions, attitudes, motivation, and others influence decision-making.'
