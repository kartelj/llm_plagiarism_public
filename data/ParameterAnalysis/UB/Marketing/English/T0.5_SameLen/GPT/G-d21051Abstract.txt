The doctoral study aimed to determine if there is room for the creation or enhancement of existing knowledge management models, allowing a comprehensive view of all connections between social capital and knowledge management. This was based on prior theoretical findings regarding the main features of social capital in relation to knowledge management within an organisation. Literature analysis revealed a substantial range of mutual relationships and influences, providing a foundation for subsequent empirical research in the nonprofit sector, specifically civil society organisations operating in the European Union and the Western Balkans. The research unveiled not only the primary characteristics of these organisations' internal and external network operations and their knowledge management maturity level, but also validated all theoretical presumptions and identified certain peculiarities. An apparent dominance of internal social capital dimensions and elements over external ones was observed, suggesting that CSOs are likely more drawn to the connections arising from their internal organisational operations. Consequently, external social capital, particularly structural forms through which it is developed and maintained, have not been adequately recognised and thus represent an area requiring significant improvement. These peculiarities were also observed when social capital dimensions and elements were compared with knowledge management phases, quality and maturity. The empirical study demonstrated that social capital elements can be incorporated into existing knowledge management models. However, due to limitations, primarily the lack of a process-based nature of their operation, it would be more practical to utilise project-based knowledge management models. For this purpose, a modified Gasik model was employed to clearly illustrate how social capital can be integrated into the knowledge management process. The application of such an integrated knowledge management model was analysed in terms of its practical usage, potentially leading to a new paradigm of CSO functioning, with knowledge being a vital prerequisite for organisational competitiveness and sustainability.
