'This thesis proposal examines the aid for operational production planning in small to medium-sized businesses (SME). A particular focus is placed on scheduling tasks, which are the most intricate planning issue at the operational stage. SMEs are the leading category of businesses in both Serbia and the European Union (EU-28). SMEs also represent the most common type of businesses in the manufacturing sector in Serbia and the EU-28 nations. Make-to-Order (MTO) production and production organization according to process are the most prevalent production forms in small and medium-sized manufacturing businesses, and the Job Shop scheduling issue is a fundamental part of operational, or short-term production planning in this group of businesses. Considering that operational production planning is directly and intimately linked to the transformation of raw materials and semi-manufactured goods, which generates and adds value, we underline the necessity to manage manufacturing resources properly in the production process (materials, machines, tools, labour force, time, money - or capital, information, market). The thesis proposal offers an overview of fundamental theoretical concepts: small and medium-sized businesses, support for SMEs, the management process in SMEs, production planning, and resource management. Furthermore, the process of operational production planning is outlined from the perspective of activities it includes. Production scheduling issues are viewed as one of the most common problems in the field of operational production planning. These include scheduling products to machines, or determining the sequence of tasks and activities that need to be carried out on each of available machines. It also includes the specification of time slots for the start and end of certain manufacturing activities. The objective of a proper schedule, or sequence of operations, stems from the capacity limitations of production resources (workers, machines and other production equipment). Thus, special focus is given to the enhancement of scheduling tasks, to create an appropriate operational planning process that aligns with the needs of a specific business. For operational production planning tasks, common problems that arise are presented (scheduling issue, work in process and inventory between operations issue, and a problem of determination of operational period length), as well as models, methods and techniques used for resolving these problems. As some of the problems are classified as NP-hard (Nondeterministic Polynomial) problems of operational research, finding the best solution, or optimal schedule, is a highly intricate problem. Therefore, in the literature, special focus is given to the heuristic approach for solving these problems. In the literature review, based on quantitative and qualitative analyses of the scientific papers, the papers that are relevant to this topic are selected, and the scientific achievements in the observed field are identified. Lastly, using the critical review of the literature, the proposal of the new research project presented in this thesis is justified. To investigate the practical aspects of the studied problem, it is assumed that operational planning of production is not at the adequate level of development in Serbian SMEs. The results of the survey conducted on a sample of 79 companies indicate a modest knowledge and application of modern methods and techniques of operations management in operational planning and resource management in the production process. Based on that, it can be concluded that SMEs require appropriate support in the field of operational planning and management of resources in the production process. In the thesis, a model of support for operational production planning and resource management in SMEs is established, in a way to consist of six phases: investigate the problem of SME in the domain of operational production planning and resource management, define the goal of support, define the support package, define indicators for monitoring the application of support, provide the support, and analyze indicators of the performance of the provided support. Within the new research project, the scheduling problem in small-scale production is defined, and is typical for single product production (i.e. one-of-a-kind production). In the literature, this problem is known as a Dual Resource Constrained Flexible Job Shop. The observed problem is modelled in the numerical computing environment and programming language MatLab (Matrix Laboratory). To solve the problem, multi- objective genetic algorithm metaheuristic is used, known as NSGA-II (Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II) with criteria functions makespan (C ) and JIT. The application of the metaheuristics, which significantly improved DRCFJS problem solving, is further on presented in the thesis.'
