'Following a review of existing literature and related research, it is found that only a select few organizations have been able to systematically identify and transfer knowledge from one project to another. It is also discovered that project performances are heavily linked to specific knowledge components. Moreover, it's concluded that knowledge is formed through the learning process in each project, and that project knowledge management should be integrated with other project management processes. The primary reasons for ineffective project management in a project environment include: organizations prioritizing the immediate task over learning, inadequate project success analysis, and inefficient documentation of project outcomes. Considering the lack of scientific support for using project outcome analysis and project success results, this doctoral dissertation is centered on analyzing project success and studying how project success outcome analysis impacts knowledge management in a project setting. This dissertation also includes a synthesis and review of the theoretical foundation for the project success analysis concept, as well as empirical research that leads to the establishment of an integrated concept for evaluating and analyzing project success. This empirical research was carried out in Serbia, with a sample of project management-focused organizations. The research confirmed a significant correlation between how knowledge is collected and transferred from past projects and how we define project success and document project success outcomes. The research findings also support the primary hypothesis: Project success analysis based on measuring project performances, when done systematically, aids in effective and efficient knowledge management in a project setting. Reviewing the research findings, it's possible to establish a systematic approach to project success analysis, based on the relationship between the aforementioned elements and the need for their formalization. The concept discussed here was applied in a project centered on information systems and technologies. Furthermore, the dissertation also outlines the pros and cons of this concept by analyzing the said project.'
