Business intelligence is a crucial foundation for decision-making processes, essential for the successful operation and management of any organization. Its core abilities include data extraction, storage, and analysis of large volumes of data. Recent studies in Business Intelligence reveal that valuable data can be obtained from unstructured sources, allowing for more precise decision-making at all management levels. An organization's capacity to establish a pervasive environment for all data extractors and decision points is vital for the success of the Smart Grid concept. Smart Grid technologies are introducing advancements in the electric power industries, impacting all aspects of the electricity supply chain, resulting in changes in market structures and business models. Business intelligence and performance management infrastructures are widely acknowledged as necessary for comprehensive energy systems adopting Smart Grid technologies. A business intelligence model for B2B e-business of the transmission system and electricity market operator, detailed in this dissertation, is specifically crafted for electricity market activity monitoring through required information and data flows. Creating a Business Intelligence solution, specifically for electricity power systems, necessitates a structured, well-defined methodology and an architecture that outlines the fundamental elements of a data warehouse. The main objective of the methodology for designing a business intelligence system proposed in this dissertation was to investigate how Kimball’s approach for modeling a business intelligence system can serve as a foundation for the implementation of new data warehouse objects, which have minimal dependence on predefined objects within the SAP environment. To realize this objective, a "bottom-up" approach was employed, supplemented by a modified dimension life-cycle adapted for Accelerated SAP for Business Warehouse methodology. The methodology outlined in this dissertation was implemented in practice, resulting in a business intelligence system for electricity market activity monitoring. The suggested solution was evaluated in the Public Enterprise "Elektromreža Srbije". The findings demonstrate that business intelligence solutions can enhance market management in a data-rich environment and can be effectively utilized for reporting in various business sectors of the organization. Additionally, comparative analysis results provide suggestions and recommendations for combined methodologies for developing robust business intelligence systems.
