IT is a driving force in contemporary society and business. It brings about changes in business systems and organizational operations. The increased use of project management skills, methods, and techniques has enhanced management systems in organizations, creating competitive market advantages. IT project management involves aligning IT and business strategies to meet the needs of internal and external stakeholders. The level of IT sophistication depends on organizational capacity and business strategy implementation approaches. A successful IT strategy needs a framework for effective technology implementation. Therefore, utilizing competency and capacity evaluation systems allows organizations to establish a quality value creation base using IT. Maturity models are modern tools for evaluating organizational competency and capacity in project management. Past research and academic and professional community studies indicate two organizational maturity analysis directions. Using general maturity assessment models on various project types has led to ignoring industry-specific competencies. Additionally, IT industry maturity models do not analyze project and organizational competencies and capacities. This thesis aims to develop a comprehensive organizational maturity assessment model incorporating both evaluation systems. Primary data from quantitative and qualitative empirical research was used to create this comprehensive IT project management maturity assessment model. The research included organizations with a well-defined IT component in their business strategy. The research involved a 360-degree organization analysis and assessment from the perspectives of IT experts, project managers, directors, investors, and end users. This is the first time such research has been conducted in Serbia, with only partial international results for some evaluation aspects. The research confirms the main hypothesis that a model based on competencies, processes, documentation, management systems, and metrics for IT project management can be created. These components influence the delivered value, knowledge management, project performance, and project management organizational system. The proposed model has led to the creation of reference measures for six maturity levels, allowing for a comparison of Serbian organizations based on best-practice IT project management. The recommended model can be implemented modularly, depending on organizational needs and market demand. The comprehensive IT project management maturity assessment model proposed in this thesis can benefit academia and the professional community by improving and expanding theoretical approaches and frameworks for maturity assessment, evaluating organizational competencies and capacities in IT project management, and defining the strategic direction of organizational development.
