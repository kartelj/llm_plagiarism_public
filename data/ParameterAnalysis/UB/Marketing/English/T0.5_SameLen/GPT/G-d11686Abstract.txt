The appropriate structuring of a logistics network offers a suitable foundation for effective supply chain management. A well-functioning logistics network can also give a company a competitive edge and assist them in adhering to the increasingly stringent environmental protection regulations and the uncertainties of the business. Logistics network configurations, such as location, facilities, and technology facilities, are critical strategic aspects of supply chain management with a significant impact on the overall performance of the supply chain. This paper presents integrated models of forward and reverse logistics supply. These models, also known as closed-loop supply chains, are networks that incorporate traditional channels and logistics activities and flows, along with the return channel. The development of an integrated logistics and reverse logistics supply network is primarily driven by the need to reduce costs throughout the entire supply chain, increase profits, and comply with legal statutes and regulations related to environmental concerns. This paper posits that operations research methods based on mathematical models of the phenomena and processes under consideration can be effectively employed for decision-making in a logistics system that includes supply and reverse processes. The research aims to contribute to the development of an integrated model of supply logistics and reverse logistics. The problem to be addressed is the determination of an integrated logistics network that unifies the logistics and reverse logistics supply network, thereby enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of the entire supply chain. In this dissertation, we introduce five models that illustrate the problems of location and route selection in integrated logistics models of supply and reverse logistics. The problems are addressed using multi-criteria analysis and heuristic methods. One of the location selection models is solved using the fuzzy AHP method. Four NP hard problems are addressed using heuristic methods. Heuristics based on the Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS) method were developed for mathematical models with one or more objective functions. For each of the four models solved using VNS, two algorithms are used. The Variable Neighborhood Descent (VND) is employed for local search for all models, and the same algorithm is used for all four models. Problems with a small number of nodes are solved optimally, and the results obtained with heuristics are compared with the optimal solutions. Optimal solutions are presented to evaluate and validate solutions obtained by heuristics. The research findings indicate that the developed heuristics offer solutions close to optimal, and that the execution time using heuristics is substantially shorter. The anticipated results should be utilized by researchers in the field studying logistics principles and logistics as a science, as well as by practitioners making logistical decisions in manufacturing companies.
