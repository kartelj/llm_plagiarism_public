Historically, it was assumed that the purpose of business entities globally was to generate profit. This assumption has been challenged in recent decades, particularly as some highly profitable companies have gone bankrupt. This raises the question, "What is required for an organization's sustainability?" Past research into this question has proposed several models that could aid in developing a sustainable business strategy. The goal of this doctoral thesis was to devise a new sustainability model for organizations, utilizing multi-criteria decision-making models to aid strategic decision-making. The study was conducted in multiple stages. The initial stage involved a literature review to identify relevant strategic decision-making indicators. The subsequent stage involved examining indicators used in the annual sustainability reports of top-rated global companies. By selecting 150 indicators, categorized into strategic perspectives based on the Balanced Scorecard, the study was conducted with the involvement of strategic decision-makers. The gathered data was analyzed using PCA and Varimax rotation to identify any correlations or groupings among the tested indicators. It was found that eight perspectives could account for 69.38% of the entire sample. The indicators that best represented these perspectives were selected based on these findings. In the following stage, the fuzzy DEMATEL method was employed to calculate the causal relationships among the selected indicators. The findings indicate that an organization's sustainable strategy relies on eight perspectives, with the learning perspective, best represented by the Exchange of Organizational Knowledge indicator, carrying the most significance. The leadership perspective is second in importance, followed by sustainability, process, social responsibility, growth/market, clients, and finances, in that order. Implementing the developed model should enhance an organization's sustainability prospects in the future.
