Increasingly, organizations are expanding their operations to the global market. The rise of globalization and international business has led to a broader internationalization of human resource management. It is now widely accepted that effective human resource management is crucial for the success of multinational companies. This doctoral dissertation tackles the challenges multinational companies face in managing diverse human resources in an international context. The dissertation outlines and clarifies the fundamental issues of international human resource management, with a focus on staffing and performance management activities. Multinational companies encounter various challenges when conducting business in different countries. One of the most critical decisions they must make relates to the standardization of human resource management activities. These companies often have to adapt their human resource management policies, practices, and procedures to the specific environment of the foreign countries where they operate. The goal of this doctoral dissertation is to uncover how multinational companies carry out staffing and performance management activities and to what degree they strive to standardize human resource management policies and practices at headquarters and various global subsidiaries. In other words, how successful they are in transferring these policies and practices from headquarters to foreign subsidiaries. The dissertation includes a literature review on international human resource management and the results of research on the standardization of human resource management practices in multinational companies. The dissertation also includes empirical research conducted in subsidiaries of foreign multinational companies in Serbia, with the aim of determining the extent to which multinational companies standardize their human resource management policies and practices in their Serbian subsidiaries, as well as identifying the primary factors influencing the transfer of these policies and practices from headquarters to foreign subsidiaries. The analysis of data collected from the survey conducted in subsidiaries of multinational companies in Serbia revealed that the companies surveyed mostly standardize their human resource management policies and practices, as well as performance management practices, but not staffing practices. Based on the research results, a new approach to human resource management was proposed, aiming to assist multinational companies in making the best possible decision regarding the extent to which they wish to align their human resource management policies and practices with those at headquarters, or adapt them to local Serbian practices.
