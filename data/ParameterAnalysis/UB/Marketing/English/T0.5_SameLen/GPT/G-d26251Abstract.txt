This doctoral thesis research focuses on creating a smart library model utilizing big data technologies and services. The primary research problem addressed in the dissertation is creating a big data infrastructure and smart library services that facilitate intelligent searches and suggestions based on library content. The paper specifically examines the potential for integrating the developed model into a smart educational setting to enhance the educational process quality. The dissertation proposes a smart library model as an essential component of the education system that could enhance the quality and comprehensiveness of learning resources and boost user motivation through content-aware suggestions. The model outlined in the dissertation explores the application of a big data system for gathering, analyzing, processing, and visualizing data from various sources, and incorporating this data into the smart library. The objective of creating a smart library is to enhance the library's business process and provide users with innovative search methods and content use. The dissertation considers the prospect of implementing a big data solution for smart libraries as part of an ongoing learning process, aiming to improve library operation outcomes by integrating traditional systems with big data technology. Besides the system components mentioned above, the model also includes the infrastructure and integration of a recommendation system for collaborative filtering by incorporating various sources of differential data with big data technologies. The model's evaluation involved testing and measuring relevant performance parameters that impact the proposed model's efficiency.
