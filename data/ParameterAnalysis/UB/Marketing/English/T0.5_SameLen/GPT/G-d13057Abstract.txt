The goal of the dissertation research is to develop the idea of integrated advertising, which is realized through optimizing performance and generating positive outcomes for both advertisers and the target demographic. The dissertation examines the impact of various advertising tools and their potential for integration to convey a cohesive message that elicits positive cognitive and emotional responses from the audience. Empirical research was carried out in December 2015 at the Faculty of Organizational Sciences, using a sample of 322 second-year students. The study was conducted in two consecutive stages. The first phase involved three experiments under controlled lab conditions, exposing participants to specific audio-visual materials, specifically tailored for this purpose, featuring indirect, direct, and integrated advertising. In the second phase, participants completed printed questionnaires designed to measure their cognitive and emotional responses. To evaluate cognitive elements, unaided recall, aided recall, and recognition tests were utilized, while for assessing emotional responses, an evaluation of participants' attitudes towards different types of advertising and advertised products was used. According to the empirical research results for all three advertising types (indirect, direct, and integrated), integrated advertising demonstrated the highest potential for brand positioning in the audience's minds. Direct advertising yielded satisfactory results (slightly less effective than integrated), which can be attributed to the audience's focus on the experimental material viewed, not reflecting the actual situation. The findings revealed that without specific prompts, audiences have difficulty remembering brands advertised indirectly, suggesting that this form of advertising alone does not yield the desired outcomes. Conversely, participants expressed positive attitudes towards indirect advertising, making it a useful tool for overcoming audience resistance, which could stem from excessive exposure to various marketing stimuli. This study's result strongly suggests the necessity for primarily planning advertising in an integrated form, with synergistic messages. Based on the findings, in the context of integrated advertising planning, indirect advertising could take precedence over direct advertising, considering several other goals besides the objective motivation to purchase. Positioning in the target audience's minds and implying a resonant effect could be a stronger incentive for long-term investments integrated with other marketing and corporate communication tools.
