The doctoral thesis research focuses on developing crowdsourcing models for smart cities, utilizing the Internet of Things (IoT) and mobile technologies. The main research issue in the thesis is the potential application of crowdsourcing, IoT, and mobile technologies to enhance smart city services. The research concentrates on analyzing, defining, and implementing various crowdsourcing models to improve life quality in smart cities. The thesis primarily investigates the readiness of citizens to implement crowdsourcing services in a smart city. The initial phase of the research aims to identify crowdsourcing services, based on IoT and mobile technologies, that will foster citizen participation. The research targets cities not yet fully compliant with smart city standards. The methodology for assessing citizen readiness involved analyzing crowdsourcing models like crowd wisdom, crowdfunding, crowdvoting, and crowdsensing, and their application in areas like traffic, environmental conservation, utilities, and health. Data was collected over two years in Belgrade, surveying a sample of 210 citizens. The findings suggest citizens are prepared to accept crowdsourcing services based on crowdfunding, crowdvoting, and crowd wisdom models. Additionally, the results show citizen interest in environmental conservation (crowdfunding services for solar energy and environmental protection) and public transportation (crowdvoting and crowd wisdom services to enhance public transport). The results, besides indicating priority services for implementation, could serve as a foundation for initiating other smart city projects. The proposed methodology and conclusions could form part of a broader framework for selecting implementation projects in other cities. The thesis outlines the development of the crowdsourcing Smart Belgrade platform, designed to motivate citizens to collaborate and achieve shared goals through collective intelligence and an organized online community. Through the platform, smart city citizens can stay informed about current issues in ecology, utilities, and public transport. Registered platform users can contribute to problem-solving, suggest new initiatives, post relevant information gathered via mobile devices, and report city issues. In addition to these services, a crowdvoting service for voting on initiatives has been implemented on the platform. The model proposed in this thesis should enhance citizen information and participation in a smart city. In the thesis, model evaluation was carried out to test the system and measure relevant parameters influencing the effectiveness and utility of the proposed model. The gathered results support the main hypothesis that developing and using crowdsourcing models based on IoT and mobile technologies enhances citizen participation in information collection, dissemination, and utilization in a smart city.
