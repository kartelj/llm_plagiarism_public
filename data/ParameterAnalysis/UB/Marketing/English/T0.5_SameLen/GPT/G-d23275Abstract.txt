The doctoral thesis focuses on devising a national-level environmental management model by incorporating risk assessment techniques, aimed at aiding national decision-making in formulating laws, policies, and national strategies, along with enhancing national-level environmental risk management. This model should also facilitate a comprehensive approach to environmental risk assessment, considering often overlooked risk factors like public perception of environmental risks and varying environmental risk propensity among different societal participants, from individuals and organizations to other social groups. The proposed national-level environmental management model that integrates risk assessment methods, as presented in this thesis, employs a hybrid approach, i.e., utilizing qualitative and quantitative risk assessment methods to rank fluctuating environmental and ecological risks, thereby aiding decision-making in prioritizing environmental management goals. Implementing this model aims to pinpoint critical areas of national-level environmental management and offer guidance in setting strategic priorities for resolving environmental issues and promoting environmental protection. One advantage of using this model is seen in the results of implementing the environmental management model at the national level, which includes improving a country's environmental quality and human health, by prioritizing environmental management goals based on ranked 7 environmental and ecological risks and by engaging the public, not just in risk perception and assessment, but also in the environmental decision-making process, thus boosting support for the establishment of a transparent and efficient national policy and strategies for a country's environmental protection.
