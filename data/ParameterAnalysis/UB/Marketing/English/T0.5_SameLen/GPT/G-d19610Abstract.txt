This doctoral thesis investigates the enhancement of customer relationship management (CRM) in the digital operations of intelligent libraries. The central issue examined in this study is the potential for integrating a CRM system into a unified library system (ILS), as a method of improving library interactions with patrons and stakeholders. To establish a CRM model in the digital operations of intelligent libraries, suitable for developing nations, this doctoral thesis explores a model based on open-source software. The model comprises an integrated library management system, a CRM system, smart technologies, mobile services, and social media services. An in-depth analysis of the research findings in the CRM field is provided. The core section of the dissertation defines a CRM model and an integration method with the ILS. The suggested model outlines the infrastructure and architecture of the CRM system in the digital operations of intelligent libraries. In the experimental section of the thesis, research was carried out to investigate the application of CRM concepts and smart technologies in libraries, and the readiness of librarians to adopt these technologies for enhancing customer relationships. Based on the developed model, a system for managing customer relations in an intelligent library is implemented by integrating CRM systems into an ILS. The results obtained validate the primary hypothesis that integrating CRM systems in the digital operations of intelligent libraries enhances library operations performance, optimizes library business processes, and improves patron communication.
