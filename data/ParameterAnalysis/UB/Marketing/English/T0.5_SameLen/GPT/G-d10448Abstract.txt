Supply chain management involves strategizing all supply-related activities, including partner coordination and collaboration. Poor coordination can lead to the bullwhip effect. Operational and behavioral factors can cause this effect in supply chains. Most researchers focus on operational causes, while behavioral causes, including personality traits, are acknowledged as significant but not extensively studied. Despite the literature stressing the need for collaboration among supply chain participants to mitigate the bullwhip effect, there's no research on cooperativity as a personality trait's impact. This dissertation examines the effect of participants' cooperativity on chain costs using a tailored beer game, demonstrating how to create a cooperative participant supply chain. Participants' cooperativity was assessed using a social value orientation questionnaire. The thesis's primary hypothesis was validated - enhancing participants' cooperativity can enhance chain functionality and address coordination issues. The research of behavioral aspects in the supply chain, including participant communication and interaction analysis, utilized transactional analysis to improve participant cooperativity in the established chain. Lastly, cooperative participants' behaviors yielding positive outcomes were established as supply chain conduct rules and incorporated into the simulation using Petri nets. This confirmed that Petri nets could incorporate various supply chain influencing factors, including personality traits, making Petri net simulations a viable alternative to real experiments.
