Conceptual reforms anticipated in the Republic of Serbia's journey towards the European Union will prominently feature the transformation of the health-social system. It's becoming increasingly clear that Serbia cannot solely depend on state health systems due to financial and organizational constraints. Therefore, the role of private health institutions in Serbia's health system will be significantly important. Despite the presence of several such institutions or systems in Serbia, this sector is evolving, and we can anticipate its dynamic growth in the future. Given these circumstances, the successful evolution of private health institutions will largely hinge on effective marketing and sales organization and the anticipation of challenges that these institutions will face in the newly begun competitive landscape. Identifying and developing a model of the interplay between sales and marketing activities and their impact on growth and brand positioning is a priority management task for private health institutions and systems. This paper aims to provide basic recommendations in line with past experiences and scientific research projects.
