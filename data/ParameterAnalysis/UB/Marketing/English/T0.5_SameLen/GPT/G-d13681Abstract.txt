The contact center plays a crucial role in ensuring productivity and efficiency as customers and prospective customers assess the contact center, bank's service offerings and products. To streamline the operations of the contact center, certain factors need to be recognized, such as the contact center's nature, technology, communication channels, workforce and their training, workforce size, shift work, and employee supervision. All these factors significantly impact business communication. The inception of the first contact centers dates back to the early fifties of the previous century and numerous transformations have since influenced business communication. Business communication can, in many respects, advance contact centers with varying organization.
