With the help of comprehensive financial risk management, financial institutions can operate more efficiently, securely, and profitably both domestically and globally. The management of financial risk responds to the dangers in financial intermediation, and this paper offers a succinct overview of the role, significance, and implications of modern financial risk management activities, particularly focusing on financial risk models. Financial institutions (both deposit and non-deposit), in addition to financial intermediaries and service providers, face various risks such as credit risk, interest rate risk, solvency, liquidity risk, market risk, operational risk, and technological risk, among others. The accumulation of these risks can potentially lead to horizontal and vertical spread of contagion, pushing the financial institution (bank) into a zone of extreme losses, even bankruptcy. Most financial risks are diverse and intricate, capable of generating disproportionately large losses when interacting with other risks, thereby continually amplifying their impacts. Implementing a risk management strategy, aided by information and communication technologies, is crucial for financial institutions to identify all existing forms of uncertainty (risk), measure, modify (if needed), and manage the uncertainty using innovative methods, financial derivatives (forward, futures, options, swaps), securitization, and other tools. In doing so, financial institutions (banks) are at liberty to engage in ventures that yield acceptable returns relative to the risk, thus fostering a business environment conducive to creating and enhancing value for their owners (stakeholders). Major regulatory changes in financial institutions, particularly in the banking sector (Basel II and Basel III), have significantly driven these transformations, tying the amount of capital to the expected level of credit risk and other risks, such as market, operational, or liquidity risk.
