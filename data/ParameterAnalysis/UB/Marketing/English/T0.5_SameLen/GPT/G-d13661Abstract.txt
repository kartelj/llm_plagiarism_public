The pharmaceutical sector is currently experiencing dynamic changes more than ever before. This global trend is filled with uncertainties and disruptions, and it is not uncommon to see misjudgments and implemented strategies. The new millennium has introduced new temptations and challenges in the social, political, and economic landscape. A considerable journey has been undertaken, transitioning from traditional medicine production to the contemporary pharmaceutical industry. This journey is marked by significant changes throughout the twentieth century, including the emergence and growth of large pharmaceutical companies in the fifties, the thalidomide disaster in the sixties, new managerial strategies in the seventies, global integration and capital concentration in the nineties, and the rapid development of biotechnology at the start of the twenty-first century. Over the past three decades, dynamic factors have significantly propelled the pharmaceutical sector forward, preventing stagnation and lethargy. Considering the circumstances and conditions under which the pharmaceutical industry operates in Serbia, the global industry's development dynamics, and the fact that strategic management and change management in this sector have not been adequately implemented, this research focuses on managing strategic changes in the pharmaceutical industry, with a particular emphasis on Serbia's pharmaceutical industry. The goal of this paper is to analyze the pharmaceutical sector and its operations, examine changes in the sector, and establish an appropriate framework for managing strategic changes in Serbia's pharmaceutical industry. The paper outlines a strategic changes concept and introduces the most crucial strategic change management models. There is a specific emphasis on Kotter's change management model, one of the most significant theoretical concepts in this area. Additionally, the fundamental elements and characteristics of healthcare and the pharmaceutical industry are examined, both globally and in Serbia. Understanding the pharmaceutical industry necessitates knowledge and comprehension of its essential mechanisms and processes, primarily the importance of pharmaceutical products' research and development, marketing and sales, and understanding expenses and pharmaceutical companies' financial strategies. Besides this analysis, the paper pays special attention to global pharmaceutical industry trends and challenges that undoubtedly affect the dynamics and development direction of Serbia's pharmaceutical industry. The healthcare and pharmaceutical markets in Serbia have unique characteristics, which are analyzed separately. European integration also implies significant changes in this strategically crucial field. The paper also highlights the potential for further growth and development of this industry in Serbia. Empirical research will also be conducted within this thesis, demonstrating the need for a systematic approach and enhancement of change management in Serbia's pharmaceutical industry. Based on the results, a strategic change management model was initiated in Serbia's pharmaceutical industry, aimed at improving company operations and increasing the efficiency of Serbia's entire health sector.
