The objective of this doctoral thesis is to create hybrid models to enhance the multi-criteria decision-making process. Current tools for multi-criteria decision-making have been demonstrated to be effective and dependable. However, their primary shortcoming, as revealed by the analysis, is their lack of sufficient focus on mutual comparison, conditionality, and logical dependencies among decision-making attributes. As a result, this thesis proposes multi-criteria models that combine traditional and fuzzy multi-criteria analysis methods, as well as the use of interpolate Boolean algebra, to address decision-making issues. The central hypothesis of the thesis is that integrating interpolate Boolean approach, fuzzy logic, and multi-criteria analysis method can model the decision-making process more effectively than using a single multi-criteria analysis method. Traditional multi-criteria analysis methods are commonly used to solve decision-making problems, despite their main limitation being the absence of an appropriate framework for presenting uncertain/imprecise attributes. These conditions are conducive to the development of fuzzy set theory, which allows for the analysis of uncertain attributes using fuzzy numbers. Therefore, this doctoral thesis developed hybrid models that merge traditional and fuzzy multi-criteria analysis methods to address identified shortcomings and achieve more reliable results. Additionally, models that incorporate interpolate Boolean algebra to handle attribute logical interactions are proposed. This approach expands the capabilities of decision-makers' linguistic statements and provides a more realistic problem perspective. The proposed models are validated using examples of ranking business banks and telecommunications equipment suppliers. An integrated model combining traditional and fuzzy multi-criteria analysis methods is proposed to address the issue of business bank selection. On the other hand, an integrated model that combines a two-stage multi-criteria analysis method and a hybrid model that includes an analysis of the logical interaction between attributes using Boolean algebra in accordance with all Boolean laws is proposed to solve the supplier ranking issue. The research findings indicate that combining multi-criteria analysis methods can overcome the limitations of traditional methods and outperform individual multi-criteria methods. Additionally, the use of interpolate Boolean algebra enabled the modeling of attribute interactions and interdependencies, making it significantly easier for decision-makers to accurately present the actual decision-making problem. The doctoral thesis's primary contribution is the enhancement of the decision-making system through the development of combined multi-criteria models in situations where decision-making attributes cannot be precisely determined if there are certain conditionalities and logical interactions among them. The main motivation for this paper is its potential practical application in real business systems.
