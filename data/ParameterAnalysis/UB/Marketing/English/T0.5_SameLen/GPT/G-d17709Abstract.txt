This study aims to identify, examine, and establish various real options, and investigate their impact on shareholder value creation. The objective, based on the results, is to suggest a novel equity valuation method for corporations with high risk and high flexibility. This study provides a synopsis of modern strategy concepts and connects them to the creation of shareholder value. Through implementing a specific strategy, a company has various real options available. Literature review helped identify different indicators of flexibility and uncertainty, suggesting a potential presence of real options. These indicators helped categorize corporations and identify those with valuable real options. Additionally, financial performance metrics of companies with high flexibility and high uncertainty were calculated and their features outlined. This doctoral dissertation recognizes and critically examines existing stock pricing models. Based on the results, excess return is linked to risk, real options, and generic strategies. This study uses panel data analysis. Different definitions of growth option were used to check the sensitivity of the suggested method. Moreover, this method is validated by comparing predicted and actual excess return outcomes. Real options indicators are significant in explaining the risk-return relationship, but the market appears more cautious in valuing these options. A cost-leadership strategy enhances the excess return for investors.
