Negotiation, as a multifaceted and evolving social process, aims to find a solution that allows all participants to meet their objectives. Establishing a concentrated and sophisticated communication system involves understanding information needs, their significance, communication pathways, communication frequency, and effectiveness. The necessity for communication is validated by the requirement for information crucial for successful negotiation, and an awareness of events that could impact value creation. This paper investigates and analyses how marketing communication affects business negotiation and value creation. The research issue of this doctoral thesis centres on exploring the interactive and interpersonal link between marketing communication tools and business negotiation stages as means of generating extra value. Viewing business negotiation as a business philosophy where marketing communication is vitally important, allows businesses to gain numerous advantages or create added value elements. By probing the target market, it aids in assessing the effect of marketing communications, and thus their influence on business negotiations. In this regard, empirical research was conducted to assess the contribution of individual communication channels, the stages of negotiation, and linear regression analyses were executed on the entire sample, separating buyers and sellers.
