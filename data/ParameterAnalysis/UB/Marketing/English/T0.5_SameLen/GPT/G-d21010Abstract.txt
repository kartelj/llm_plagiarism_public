Open badges, an innovative educational technology, acknowledge the accomplishments, abilities, characteristics, and passions of an individual or group. Recently, there's been an increase in software systems that utilize the Open Badges Infrastructure (OBI), supporting diverse teaching/learning and badging methods. However, their effectiveness in a specific educational context can differ greatly. This presents significant challenges for educators when selecting a system for a specific educational use. The goal of this study is to suggest potential usability metrics - both general and OBI-specific, that can be beneficial in choosing this educational technology. The primary outcome of the research is a methodological structure that comprises standard general usability metrics (for example, perceived usability score based on System Usability Scale) and the OBI-specific usability metrics developed during the research (for example, 'ease of sharing badges' score, 'support for badge creation satisfaction' score, etc.). The suggested method has been tested in an empirical study using a mixed research methodology. The study's findings confirmed the effectiveness of the suggested method in the given context. It was demonstrated that the proposed metric categories complement each other and that the metrics satisfactorily differentiated the systems evaluated. Moreover, the qualitative evaluation results highlighted the main usability issues of the systems evaluated. The method can be implemented in various educational environments, considering the proposed metrics are relatively easy to gather and understand.
