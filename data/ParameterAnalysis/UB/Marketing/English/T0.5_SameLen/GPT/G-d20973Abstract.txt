This doctoral thesis focuses on advancing the methodology for building and assessing composite indicators, developed by experts at the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the Joint Research Center (JRC). Composite indicators are measurements created by combining individual indicators that evaluate diverse facets of a multi-dimensional concept, given certain weightings. These composite indicators are increasingly utilized by decision makers to rank and assess entities across various subjects. The OECD-JRC methodology offers beneficial guidance for the intricate procedure of constructing the methodological framework for the composite indicator. However, the weighting procedure and the robustness and sensitivity analysis continue to draw interest. The weighting method proposed in this doctoral thesis aims to identify the weighting scheme that optimizes the stability of the measurement, gauged by the sum of standard deviations of relative contributions of indicators. To establish the model constraints, the bootstrap IvanoviÄ‡ distance (I-distance) is suggested, while the metaheuristics enhanced Scatter Search (eSS) is employed to address the identified optimization problem. The new method considers the stability of the composite indicator during the weighting scheme identification process and suggests a data-driven weighting scheme that lessens the level of intuitivity and addresses the issue that the robustness analysis is often omitted in the construction and evaluation of composite indicators. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed weighting method can be effectively implemented in the construction and evaluation of composite indicators.
