The aim of the doctoral dissertation is to highlight and elucidate how business intelligence systems can be enhanced through group decision-making processes. In the realm of business intelligence, the word 'intelligence' primarily refers to data or information designed to aid business decision-making. Viewed in this light, business intelligence aids navigation in novel circumstances and aids in quick and precise problem-solving. However, it diverges from the traditional psychological interpretation of the term intelligence as it pertains not to an individual's personal ability, but to a technological solution implemented by an organization. Business intelligence should not be perceived as a product or a system, but rather as an architecture and an amalgamation of integrated operational applications and decision support applications. Business intelligence embodies the utilization of all data resources, hence the corporate information and knowledge aimed at facilitating improved and relevant business decisions, and consequently the capacity to recognize new business opportunities. Assisting an individual decision-maker is a crucial activity for any successful corporate management. However, as business operations and functions increasingly become complex and the accountability for decisions made grows larger, it becomes necessary to consider all diverse ideas and perspectives held by team members, specifically the available body of knowledge for group decision-making. Furthermore, it is a mathematically substantiated truth that the collective knowledge of all team members inherently surpasses the knowledge of any individual team member. The only requirement here is existing communication and resource sharing among team members. Conversely, the demand for quality enhancement in group decision-making is apparent. This is a continuing subject of interest for researchers with substantial practical and theoretical knowledge. Therefore, the matters of knowledge acquisition, storage, and distribution will receive special focus and consideration; knowledge will underpin all sections of the thesis and will form the binding fabric of the paper.
