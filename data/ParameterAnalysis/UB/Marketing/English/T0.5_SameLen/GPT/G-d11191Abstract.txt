The dissertation's focus is on the potential to create a versatile and adaptable process performance measurement model. As modern organizational management involves process management, the organization's goal attainment is tied to its processes' success. Key performance indicators are used to measure process success. Part of the study examines the interplay between the organization's highest-level goals and process performance indicators in companies that have adopted a process approach. The research explores methods and opportunities to enhance the adaptability and flexibility of the process performance measurement system, including an analysis and description of existing performance measurement models and the creation of a unique, flexible, and adaptable model. This development includes defining the model (its structure, connections, and interdependencies), applying it in practice, and refining it based on results. The dissertation's central hypothesis, which has been developed and validated, is: Formalizing the interdependencies between an organization's highest goals and key process performance indicators can enhance the adaptability and flexibility of business performance measurement systems. A scientific description and comparative analysis of current process performance measurement models was conducted based on a comprehensive literature review. Subsequently, the new GPI (Goal; Process; Indicator) model was proposed. This model allows for the direct identification of interdependencies between top-level goals and process performance indicators, offering a degree of adaptability and flexibility. A case study was then undertaken. The model, which was previously conceptualized, is refined based on the study's findings. The research findings and proposed GPI model provide a foundation for improved and simplified performance management, as well as further research in this field.
