: The goal of this research is to present, analyze, and determine different types of real options, and to explore their influence on shareholder value creation. Based on the findings, the aim is to propose a new equity valuation approach, for high risk high flexibility corporations. This research presents an overview of contemporary strategy concepts and relates them to the shareholder value creation. By conducting a certain strategy, company has different real options at its disposal. Based on the literature review, different flexibility and uncertainty indicators were determined which can suggest that there is a potential for the presence of the real options. These indicators were used to sort corporations, and to determine which have valuable real options. Furthermore, financial performance measures of high flexibility, high uncertainty companies were calculated and their characteristics were presented. This doctoral thesis identifies and critically addresses existing stock pricing models. Based on all the findings, excess return is related to the risk, real options, and generic strategies. Panel data analysis is employed in this research. Different growth option definitions were used to test the sensitivity of the proposed approach. Additionally, this approach is verified through comparison of the predicted and actual excess return results. Real options indicators show significance for an explanation of the risk-return relationship, but it can be seen that the market is more conservative when valuing those options. Cost-leadership strategy increases the investorsâ€™ excess return.
