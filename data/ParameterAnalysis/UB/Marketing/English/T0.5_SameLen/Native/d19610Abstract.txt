: The subject of this doctoral dissertation research is the development of customer relationship management (CRM) in the electronic business of smart libraries. The main problem explored in this paper is to examine the possibility of integrating the customer relationship management system into an integrated library system (ILS) as one of the methods for improving library communication with patrons and stakeholders. In order to implement customer relationship management model in the electronic business of smart libraries, suitable for developing countries, the model based on open source software is explored in this doctoral dissertation. The model consists of the following components: an integrated library management system, customer relationship management system, smart technologies, mobile services and social media services. A detailed analysis of the research results in the field of customer relationship management is presented. In the central part of the thesis, a model for customer relationships management is defined, as well as a method for integration with the integrated library system. The proposed model presents the infrastructure and architecture of the customer relationship management system in the electronic business of smart libraries. In the experimental part of the dissertation, research was conducted aimed at examining the use of CRM concepts and smart technologies in libraries, as well as the willingness of librarians to accept the use of these technologies in order to improve customer relationships. Based on the developed model, a system for managing customer relations in a smart library is implemented, by integrating CRM systems into an integrated library system. The obtained results confirmed the main hypothesis that the integration of customer relationship management systems in the electronic business of smart libraries improves the performance of library operations, optimizes library business processes and improves communication with patrons.
