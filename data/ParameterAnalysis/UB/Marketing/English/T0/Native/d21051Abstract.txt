The goal of the doctoral research was to establish whether there exists a space for development of a new or improvement of the existing models of knowledge management that would allow holistic view of all links that exist between social capital and knowledge management, based on the previously established theoretical findings related to key characteristics of social capital in the context of knowledge management in the organisation. Through analysis of the literature a significant scope of mutual relations and infuences were discovered that set a basis for afterwards empirical research in the nonprofit sector that is on the civil society organisations that work in the European Union and the Western Balkans. The research disclosed not only key characteristics of internal and external network operations of these organisations and their level of knowledge management maturity but confirmed all the theoretical assumptions and established certain specificities. There was discovered an obvious dominance of the dimensions and elements of internal social capital over the external ones which speaks to the fact that CSOs probably are more inclined to the links that come from their organisational inner operations that is from the links realized through individuals and the elements that characterize these links and are found in relational, cognitive and nodus dimensions. In that sense, external social capital, first of all structural forms through which it is established and nurtured, have not been sufficiently recognized and therefore represent a field that should be further significantly improved. These specificities were also noticed when dimensions and elements of social capital were crossed with knowledge management phases, quality and maturity. The empirical research did show that the elements of social capital may be integrated in the existing knowledge management models but that due to the limitations, mostly reflected through absence of process based nature of their functioning, it would be more practical to use the project based models of knowledge management. To that end a modified Gasik model was used to provide a clear presentation on how the social capital may be integrated in the knowledge management process. Application of such integrated knowledge management model has been analysed in the context of its practical usage through which a new paradigm of CSO working could be obtained emphasizing the knowledge as a key precondition for organizational competitive and sustainable work.
