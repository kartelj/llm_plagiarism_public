The subject of the doctoral (Ph.D.) dissertation, “Strategic and Economic Aspects of Noble Organization Development with the Aim of Achieving Leading Position in Environment” by Tanja Milić and the main goal of the research is to analyze possibilities, i.e., the development of a new concept that will contribute to improving the business of organization and the achievement of long-term sustainable prestigious leading positions. The author believes that this goal can be achieved by developing the concept of noble organization as the innovative model of reaching, nurturing and preserving the leading position, which unites all currently known concepts associated with the new primary purpose of companies, and based on new noble values in relation of the company to its customers and stakeholders in general, as well as of the company itself. Requirements of the modern business environment necessitate the “creaming” of new values and principles that will launch organization, i.e., company to the very top. The increasingly rapid pace of scientific, technological, and social development, and related to them faster globalization and market integration, sophistication of consumers, and the growing abundance of goods, services and resources needed for their implementation, as well as the dramatic changes that have occurred in the first decades of the 21st century in business and living environment caused by human activity, influence the fact that companies need to turn to other ways of winning customers and other stakeholders in order to reach leading position. It is increasingly being recognized that an organization, in order to achieve successful results, must direct its actions towards its stakeholders, and that within these relationships, according to the author of this dissertation, strategies based on noble values must be implemented. IX Noble organization is a concept that should lead to the realization of stakeholder commitment, especially of consumers to the company and their continuing attachment to it, thus ensuring long-term sustainable profit and the noble organization leadership in relation to other companies. Spiritual, noble motives, and approach to the major stakeholders of the company and their preservation and attention directed towards them will help them “forget” about other companies, competitors and to bind to it as a noble organization, an organization that lives and exists because of them, which gives all its best for their own good and that is their helper, support and reliance, someone they can have confidence in. This concept will ensure desired goal realization, which will ensure the achievement of high quality, sustainable, stable, persistent profits and consistent growth and development to organization. Even in times of economic crisis, when, despite a possible decline in sales and profits caused by lower purchasing power of consumers, with the first signs of exiting the crisis period, it will generate higher growth and profit in relation to other companies, but also during the crisis noble organization will be in a better position than others, because it will save the commitment and support of consumers and other stakeholders. In this doctoral dissertation noble organization is described, its concept, its functioning and its construction, the results of research related to consumer response to certain noble aspects of the company and how these aspects affect their attachment to the company, as well as the stability and solidity of their relationship for the company are presented. Also, results are given of research related to the intrinsic, current characteristics of the companies, as guidelines for further development in order to achieve a noble – a leading organization. Since this is a new concept and noble organization does not exist in practice, the research of general public and representatives of business organizations, as well as best practices is initially focused only on examining the impact and importance of certain noble business segments of existing companies and values, as well as their aspirations for a potential noble organization to approximate the results of the desirability of introducing the concept of the noble organization to business systems. X Research results showed that noble values and the concept of the noble organization are highly preferred by the respondents of the general public. In terms of public attitudes towards noble organization a very high percentage of respondents who expressed positive attitudes and behaviors and desired outcomes towards such an organization is viewed, which indicates the broad acceptance of potential noble organization that would emerge in the market, and thus the achievement of the leading position in environment by such organization. Also, presented examples of companies that foster individual aspects of noble organization with excellent economic results achieved indicate the justification for the development and introduction of the concept of the noble organization to business systems. Results of descriptive statistics analysis indicate a high potential power of noble organization in relation to attracting and retaining stakeholders, and hence achieving high business performance, weakening the influence and importance of its competitors, as well as improving the world in which we live, by which initially set hypotheses are indicatively confirmed. Furthermore, research results of existing business organizations show that organizations that have in a greater extent and that value more noble values and business aspects are more successful economically than other organizations. Also, research has established statistically significant difference in the evaluation of all tested values, virtues and aspects of business by the public and by business organizations for the benefit of the public, which indicates the need to raise awareness of the importance and presence of observed values, virtues and aspects of doing business in business organizations, as well as an open space for action, implementation, and application of the noble organization concept developed in this dissertation. The concept is explored from all aspects of the organization, and the final image of the noble organization is given with instructions of its operation, and development. It is expected, that this dissertation will open up an entirely new way, which companies need to follow, which will lead to a multiple increase of their inflows and profits, as well as maintaining the stability of their acquired positions, their very improvements, and improving the quality of life itself.
