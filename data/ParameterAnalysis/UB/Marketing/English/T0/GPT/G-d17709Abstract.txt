This study aims to examine, categorize, and identify various real options and their impact on the creation of shareholder value. The objective is to suggest a novel method for equity valuation, specifically for corporations with high risk and high flexibility. The study provides a comprehensive review of modern strategy concepts and their connection to shareholder value creation. A company can utilize various real options by implementing a specific strategy. A literature review helped identify indicators of flexibility and uncertainty, suggesting the potential existence of real options. These indicators were utilized to categorize corporations and identify those with valuable real options. The financial performance metrics of companies with high flexibility and uncertainty were calculated and their features outlined. This doctoral dissertation scrutinizes and critically discusses existing stock pricing models. The excess return is linked to risk, real options, and generic strategies based on the findings. This study uses panel data analysis. Various definitions of growth options were tested to gauge the sensitivity of the suggested method. The proposed approach was also validated by comparing predicted and actual excess return results. Real options indicators are significant in explaining the risk-return relationship, but the market appears more cautious in valuing these options. The cost-leadership strategy enhances the excess return for investors.
