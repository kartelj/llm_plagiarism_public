Increasingly, organizations are expanding their operations to the global market. The rise of globalization and international business has led to a broader internationalization of human resource management. It is now widely accepted that effective human resource management is crucial to the success of multinational companies. This doctoral dissertation explores the challenges multinational companies face in managing diverse human resources in an international context. It defines and elaborates on the fundamental issues of international human resource management, focusing primarily on staffing and performance management. Multinational companies often encounter various challenges when conducting business in different countries, one of the most critical being the decision to standardize human resource management activities. These companies frequently need to adapt their human resource management policies, practices, and procedures to the specific environments of the foreign countries where they operate. The goal of this dissertation is to uncover how multinational companies carry out staffing and performance management activities and the degree to which they standardize human resource management policies and practices in their headquarters and various worldwide subsidiaries. The dissertation reviews literature on international human resource management and presents research results on the standardization of human resource management practices in multinational companies. It includes empirical research conducted in foreign multinational company subsidiaries in Serbia, aiming to determine the extent of standardization of their human resource management policies and practices, and to identify the main factors influencing the transfer of these policies and practices from headquarters to foreign subsidiaries. The survey results from Serbian subsidiaries of multinational companies indicate that these companies mostly standardize their human resource management and performance management practices, but not their staffing practices. Based on these findings, a new approach to human resource management is proposed, aimed at helping multinational companies decide the extent to which they should align their human resource management policies and practices with those at headquarters, or adapt them to local Serbian practices.
