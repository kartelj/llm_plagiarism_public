The paper aims to enhance understanding of quality costing in current practices and ascertain the necessity of establishing a quality cost model within a process-systemic approach. It features a study conducted on 186 companies across various industries, all of which are familiar with quality costs. The research database was compiled based on three indicators of the companies' knowledge of quality costs. The findings indicate a high awareness of the importance of quality costs and a growing number of companies managing these costs. The study also highlights factors influencing quality costs management systems and analyzes the relationships between variables that define these systems. Furthermore, it identifies the requirements of the ISO 9001:2015 standard that are significantly associated with the variables defining quality costs management, as per the companies' views on the importance of meeting these requirements. The research findings underscore the need to establish a quality cost model within a process-systemic approach. Therefore, this paper utilizes the PAF model at the process level to propose a quality cost model that considers the elements of quality costs in relation to process outputs and acknowledges that one process's outputs can affect another process's quality. The model calculates quality costs for each process at two points: current (before measures are implemented) and expected (after measures are implemented). Based on the analysis of nonconformity causes, necessary control or improvement measures are implemented, adhering to the PAF model's assumption that preventive and appraisal activities reduce failure costs and total quality costs. The model views the difference in total quality costs at the two observed points as the maximum potential quality cost reduction for the process in question. This value is used to prioritize processes for implementing defined control or improvement measures, based on the PAF model's assumption that higher costs imply lower quality and thus a higher priority for implementing such measures.
