The mining industry's continuous demand for advanced solutions and more efficient, dependable, and safer production methods throughout all stages of the production process, from planning and design to the permanent halt of mining activities, promotes collaboration between the mining industry and research, science, education, technical equipment, technology, work organization, and the establishment of norms and standards. The outcomes of mining production are not solely reliant on natural conditions, workforce professionalism, technical-technological equipment, industrial-economic, and socio-political environment. They are significantly influenced by the effectiveness of supervision and management structure, or mining management. This understanding guided the selection and definition of the doctoral dissertation's theme presented here, which focuses on examining the impacts of international standards on the Serbian mining industry. The research aims to review global and national achievements in this field, study the philosophy of management systems and international standards globally and nationally, and assess the adaptability and adequacy of management systems based on international standards in the mining industry's multivariable conditions. Our research confirms the initial hypothesis that international standards are insufficient for effective mining systems management. Consequently, we propose a structural model that integrates international standards, adequately addressing mining management needs and aiming to achieve exploitation, safety, production, and ecological security objectives. The issues addressed in the doctoral dissertation are both significant and urgent. The dissertation holds scientific and practical importance for the mining industry, as evidenced by the research results in both areas.
