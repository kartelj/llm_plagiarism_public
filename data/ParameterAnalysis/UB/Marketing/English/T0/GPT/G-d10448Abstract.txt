Supply chain management involves planning all activities related to supply, and coordinating and collaborating with chain partners. The bullwhip effect can occur due to a lack of coordination, with operational and behavioral factors contributing to this effect. While many researchers focus on operational causes, behavioral causes, including personality traits, are often overlooked. Despite the recognized need for collaboration to mitigate the bullwhip effect, the role of cooperation as a personality trait has not been studied. This dissertation investigates the influence of participant cooperativity on supply chain costs using a custom beer game, and provides guidance on creating a cooperative supply chain. Participant cooperativity was assessed through a social value orientation questionnaire. The primary hypothesis of the dissertation was validated - increased participant cooperativity can enhance supply chain function and aid in addressing complex coordination issues. The research also examined behavioral phenomena in the supply chain, and used transactional analysis to study communication and interaction between participants, offering ways to boost cooperativity. Finally, the behaviors of cooperative participants that yielded positive results were identified as conduct rules in the supply chain and incorporated into a simulation using Petri nets. This demonstrated that Petri nets can accommodate various factors influencing supply chains, including personality traits, suggesting that Petri net simulations could substitute real experiments.
