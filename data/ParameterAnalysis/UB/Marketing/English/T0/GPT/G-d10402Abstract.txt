The development of employees within manufacturing companies is a fundamental aspect of a company's growth. It is a key differentiator between companies in a competitive market. The growth and development of employees is a driving force for companies, providing a significant competitive edge. Employee development in production companies is becoming an increasingly important aspect of a company's operations. Previously, this was not a strategic focus for production companies, but with the shift to market economic conditions, employers are beginning to understand and accept its importance. As such, there is a need for further improvement in this area.

This paper focuses on the key factors influencing employee development in manufacturing companies, viewing it as a systematic activity and a crucial prerequisite for further scientific and overall development. After reviewing theoretical works and practical experiences, this paper aims to identify potential solutions to the primary challenges in the field of employee development. The goal is to define the factors that directly influence employee development, with the intention of creating a competitive advantage in the markets where these companies operate.

The rapid changes in the business environment necessitate the development of employees, particularly in terms of acquiring and improving new knowledge and skills. The objective is to enhance the performance of employees and thereby strengthen the competitive advantage of the companies.
