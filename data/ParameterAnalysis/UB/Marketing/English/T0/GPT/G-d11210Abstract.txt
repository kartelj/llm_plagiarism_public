The primary objective of this doctoral thesis is to create hybrid models to enhance the multi-criteria decision-making process. Current tools supporting this process have demonstrated their reliability and efficiency. However, a key drawback is their lack of focus on the mutual comparison, conditionality, and logical dependencies among decision-making attributes. As a result, the thesis proposes multi-criteria models that combine traditional and fuzzy methods of multi-criteria analysis, along with the application of interpolate Boolean algebra. The central hypothesis is that a combination of interpolate Boolean approach, fuzzy logic, and multi-criteria analysis method can model the decision-making process more effectively than a single method of multi-criteria analysis. Traditional methods of multi-criteria analysis, commonly used to address decision-making problems, are limited by their inability to adequately represent uncertain/imprecise attributes. This limitation paves the way for the development of fuzzy set theory, which allows for the analysis of uncertain attributes using fuzzy numbers. Consequently, this doctoral thesis develops hybrid models that merge traditional and fuzzy methods of multi-criteria analysis to address these shortcomings and yield more reliable results. The models also incorporate interpolate Boolean algebra to account for logical attribute interactions, thereby enhancing the expressiveness of decision-makers' linguistic statements and providing a more realistic problem perspective. The proposed models are tested using examples of ranking business banks and telecommunications equipment suppliers. An integrated model combining traditional and fuzzy methods of multi-criteria analysis is proposed to address the business bank selection problem. Conversely, a hybrid model combining a two-stage multi-criteria analysis method and an analysis of logical attribute interactions using Boolean algebra is proposed to address the supplier ranking problem. The research results indicate that combining multi-criteria analysis methods can overcome the limitations of traditional methods and outperform individual multi-criteria methods. Additionally, the application of interpolate Boolean algebra facilitates the modeling of attribute interactions and interdependencies, making it easier for decision-makers to accurately represent the actual decision-making problem. The doctoral thesis's key contribution is the enhancement of the decision-making system through the development of combined multi-criteria models, particularly in situations where decision-making attributes cannot be precisely determined and where certain conditionalities and logical interactions exist. The primary motivation for this research is its potential practical application in real business systems.
