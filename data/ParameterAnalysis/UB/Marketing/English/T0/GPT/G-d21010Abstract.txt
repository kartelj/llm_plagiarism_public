Open badges, an emerging educational technology, are used to acknowledge the accomplishments, abilities, traits, and interests of individuals or groups. Recently, there has been an increase in software systems that utilize the Open Badges Infrastructure (OBI) to support various teaching, learning, and badging methods. However, the effectiveness of these systems can greatly differ depending on the educational setting, posing a challenge for educators in selecting the most suitable system. This study aims to suggest potential usability metrics, both general and specific to OBI-compliant systems, that can aid in the selection process. The primary outcome of this research is a methodological framework that incorporates standard general usability metrics, such as the System Usability Scale score, and newly developed technology-specific usability metrics, such as 'ease of sharing badges' and 'support for badge creation satisfaction' scores. This proposed method was tested in an empirical study using a mixed research method. The study's findings confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed method in the given context, demonstrating that the suggested metric categories are complementary and successfully differentiated the systems evaluated. Furthermore, the qualitative evaluation results highlighted the main usability issues of the systems evaluated. This method can be implemented in various educational contexts, as the suggested metrics are relatively straightforward to gather and interpret.
