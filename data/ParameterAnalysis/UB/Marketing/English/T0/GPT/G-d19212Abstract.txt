This dissertation primarily focuses on the analysis of remote sensing methodology, specifically the collection and preparation of data for processing, and the use of statistical methods for classification. The research aims to propose a methodology for defining the sensitivity zone in the classification of phenomena, primarily using multivariate analysis statistical methods. Remote sensing, a scientific field and technique for collecting information about an object without direct contact, is often paired with image processing disciplines and a geographic information system (GIS) for geospatial science and technology. This dissertation explores the link between GIS and remote sensing, with GIS being a crucial tool in spatial data analysis. 

The dissertation also delves into the classification of remotely-sensed data, particularly the identification and classification of image pixels. The classification is performed on multiple data sets, with the goal of assigning each pixel of an image to a specific class based on the statistical characteristics of the pixel's intensity and color. 

The dissertation also discusses multivariate analysis, a set of statistical methods that simultaneously analyze multidimensional measurements obtained for each observation unit from a set of objects. Data clustering techniques and Discriminant Analysis are also discussed, with the latter being at the core of the proposed method. 

The dissertation also introduces the concept of digital images and their processing in remote sensing, and reviews widely used classification methods. The accuracy of the maps generated by remote sensing is evaluated by comparison with reference data, known as “ground truth”. 

The research aims to develop a methodology that will improve the overall classification accuracy using the sensitivity zone, while reducing the time and resources needed for running the classification. The dissertation also presents case studies and the possibilities of applying the sensitivity zone in remote sensing for precision agriculture. 

The proposed method was tested in several different types of crops, and the results were compared with other classification methods in use. The dissertation concludes with answers to questions related to the goals and hypotheses set, and the appendix briefly describes the developed software solution through which the research and data analysis was conducted.
