The doctoral thesis primarily focuses on the field of information society, its progression, and the mechanisms used to monitor and measure its advancements. It encapsulates existing research and theories on the topic of information society, its evolution, various forms, growth determinants, and numerous international initiatives aimed at steering its global progress. The thesis explores ways to quantify the information society, a complex concept defined by a set of interrelated indicators, and investigates the most suitable metrics for observing, measuring, and evaluating its current state. 

The thesis also provides a classification and evolution path of benchmarking indicators, which are fundamental to any methodology aimed at quantifying the information society. It includes an overview of the most relevant methodologies used globally for evaluating the information society. The primary focus of the work is the creation of a unique model that outlines the necessary actions to monitor and evaluate advancements in Serbia's information society. 

This model is based on theoretical foundations, is compatible with EU standards, and takes into account the specificities of Serbia's information society and its potential for investment and further development. The model's formulation includes the selection of Information Society Indicators (ISI) in line with EU standards, but modified to suit Serbia's characteristics and development potential. 

The model has been tested in Serbia, monitoring and analyzing its information society over a five-year period. The verification process involved statistical monitoring, quantification, and relevant data analysis, as well as an analysis of the results to determine the current state, identify and quantify 'critical points' in the development of Serbia's information society, and forecast its future progress. 

The thesis contributes professionally by evaluating the development of Serbia's information society from both the population and economic perspectives. It also quantifies and evaluates the intensity of the digital divide and its trends, and identifies the most digitally underdeveloped groups within Serbia's population. 

The thesis's basic scientific contribution is the formulation of a model for monitoring and evaluating the development of the information society. This model uses the I-distance method and cluster analysis, two appropriately combined methods of multivariate analysis. The initial set of indicators has been reduced to the most relevant ones, after ranking according to their I-distance value and applying cluster analysis. 

The thesis also defines a model for quantifying individual and total digital divide in different areas, introducing the digital polarization index. The model is general, flexible, and open to adding or changing its basic components, allowing for the identification, definition, and calculation of various individual sub-indices of digital polarization. 

The social contribution of the thesis is its potential application in monitoring and quantifying the information society and guiding its development. The formulated model can be used as a strategic decision support tool, a tool for observing and minimizing the digital divide, and a tool for supporting the evaluation of different complex social phenomena outside the information society framework.
