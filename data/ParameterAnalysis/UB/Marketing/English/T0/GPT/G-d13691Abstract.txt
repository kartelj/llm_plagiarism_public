Cyber warfare, a form of conflict that occurs in cyberspace, is facilitated by the use of information communication technologies. It is a unique form of international conflict, differing from traditional warfare in terms of means, methods, and participants. Cyber warfare can occur during both war and peace times and is not significantly technologically different from criminal, espionage, or terrorist activities. The potential for this technologically-based conflict grows with the increasing prevalence and influence of information technologies at both national and global levels. 

States are investing more in conducting cyberspace conflict, developing capacities and organizational structures for operations in cyberspace, and adopting doctrines and strategies for their application and development. Some states have even declared cyberspace as the fifth domain of military activities, on par with land, sea, air, and space. However, the international community tends to regulate all conflicts, including cyber warfare, typically through the application of existing laws of armed conflict and analogies with appropriate armed conflict situations in physical space. 

Despite the relatively short period for the development of doctrines, methods, and means for cyberspace operations, there is a wealth of scientific and professional literature exploring possible ways of applying these analogies for the regulation of cyber warfare. A significant portion of this literature focuses on the application of law based on the effects of cyber attacks. This approach has been widely accepted by most international legal experts, including the authors of the Tallinn Manual for cyber warfare. 

However, the practical situations and consequences of conducting cyber attacks at the international level remain unresolved and unregulated. States carry out operations in cyberspace, taking advantage of the difficulty in discovering attacks until their obvious consequences are manifested and the often impossibility of identifying and attributing attackers, i.e., practically determining a state's responsibility for an attack and its consequences in accordance with the rules, norms, and principles of International law of armed conflict. 

Given the importance of cyber conflict and warfare in modern international relations and the expected growth of their importance in line with future development of information technologies, as well as the inability to practically regulate situations through the application of traditional armed conflict law, this dissertation focuses on the international legal regulation of conflict in cyberspace. The research objective is to understand the nature of cyber warfare and cyberspace conflict to propose a way to regulate it in the future. 

The research results show that cyber warfare is a technologically dependent form of conflict that occurs in cyberspace and is conceptually different from all traditional forms of conflict in the physical environment. The key problems of international legal regulation of cyber warfare are the frequent inability to discover cyber attacks, to identify and attribute attackers, and to determine state responsibility for attacks. These problems originate from the technological nature of cyber warfare and therefore cannot be efficiently resolved by exclusive legal regulation, without the application of suitable technological solutions. 

The dissertation offers a comprehensive analysis of a large number of relevant sources of notions, definitions, and concepts, based on which key characteristics of cyberspace and conflicts within cyberspace are determined. The dissertation also covers the problems of applying traditional International Law of Armed Conflict to conflicts in cyberspace, analyses key notions, concepts, and phenomena important for cyber warfare between states, and offers a proposal for future behavior of states for the purpose of building capabilities for cyber defense from cyberspace attacks and international legal action in future regulation of cyberspace conflicts. 

The dissertation concludes that the future of cyber warfare depends primarily on the development of information communication technologies, not the capability of the international community to legally regulate cyberspace conflicts in a traditional way. The dissertation also suggests that the only possible direction for practical regulation of cyber conflict at the international level is through bilateral and multilateral collaboration of interested parties in the international community. The solution for limiting cyber conflicts lies in the combined application of diplomatic, political, economic, military, legal, information, and other efforts and activities.
