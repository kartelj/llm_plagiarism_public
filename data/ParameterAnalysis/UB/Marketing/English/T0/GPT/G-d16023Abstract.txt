Information technologies (IT) are the driving forces behind contemporary society and business growth. They instigate changes in business systems and organizational operations. The increasing use of project management skills, methods, and techniques has enhanced management systems in organizations, creating competitive market advantages. IT project management involves aligning IT and business strategies to meet the needs of both internal and external stakeholders. The level of IT application and sophistication depends on the organization's capacity and the strategies used in business implementation. A successful IT strategy requires a framework for effective technology implementation. Thus, the use of competency and capacity evaluation systems allows organizations to establish a quality foundation for value creation through IT. 

Maturity models are modern tools for assessing organizational competency and capacity in project management. Past research and academic and professional studies suggest two directions in organizational maturity analysis. The use of general maturity assessment models across various project types has led to the neglect of industry-specific competencies. Furthermore, maturity models used in the IT industry do not analyze project and organizational competencies and capacities. 

This thesis aims to develop a comprehensive model for organizational maturity assessment that includes both evaluation systems. Primary data collected through quantitative and qualitative empirical research were used to create this comprehensive model for IT project management maturity assessment. The research included organizations with a well-defined IT component in their business strategy. The research process involved a 360-degree analysis and assessment of the organization from the perspectives of IT experts, project managers, directors, investors, and end users. This is the first study of its kind in the Republic of Serbia, with only partial international results for some general and specific evaluation aspects. 

The research results support the main hypothesis that it is possible to create a model based on competencies, processes, documentation, management systems, and metrics for IT project management. These components influence the value delivered, knowledge management, project performance, and the project management organizational system. Based on the proposed model, reference measures for six maturity levels were created. These measures allow for a comparison of Serbian organizations according to their best-practice IT project management. The recommended model can be implemented in modules, depending on organizational needs and market demand. 

The comprehensive model for IT project management maturity assessment proposed in this thesis can benefit both academia and the professional community. This is because the proposed model can enhance and broaden theoretical approaches and frameworks for maturity assessment, evaluate organizational competencies and capacities in IT project management, and define the strategic direction of organizational development.
