This doctoral thesis focuses on advancing the methodology for building and assessing composite indicators, a process developed by experts from the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the Joint Research Center (JRC). Composite indicators are metrics that combine individual indicators measuring various facets of a multi-dimensional concept. These indicators are increasingly used by decision-makers to rank and assess entities across diverse topics. The OECD-JRC methodology offers valuable guidance for constructing the methodological framework of the composite indicator. However, the weighting method and the robustness and sensitivity analysis remain areas of ongoing interest. This thesis proposes a weighting method aimed at identifying a weighting scheme that enhances the stability of the metric, as measured by the sum of standard deviations of relative contributions of indicators. The bootstrap IvanoviÄ‡ distance (I-distance) is suggested to set the model constraints, while the enhanced Scatter Search (eSS) metaheuristics is employed to solve the optimization problem. This novel method considers the stability of the composite indicator during the weighting scheme determination process and suggests a data-driven weighting scheme that minimizes intuitivity and addresses the lack of robustness analysis in the construction and evaluation of composite indicators. Experimental results demonstrate the successful application of the proposed weighting method in the construction and evaluation of composite indicators.
