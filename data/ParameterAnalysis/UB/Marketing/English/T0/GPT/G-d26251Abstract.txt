This doctoral research thesis focuses on the creation of a smart library model utilizing big data technologies and services. The primary research issue addressed is the creation of a big data infrastructure and smart library services that facilitate intelligent searches and recommendations from the library's content. The paper specifically explores the potential for integrating the developed model into a smart educational environment to enhance the quality of education. 

The thesis introduces a smart library model as a crucial component of the educational system, aiming to improve the quality and comprehensiveness of learning resources and boost user motivation through content-aware recommendations. The model discussed in the thesis explores the potential of using a big data system for collecting, analyzing, processing, and visualizing data from various sources, and integrating this data into the smart library. 

The objective of creating a smart library is to enhance the library's business process and provide users with innovative search and content usage methods. The thesis considers the prospect of implementing a big data solution for smart libraries as part of an ongoing learning process, aiming to improve library operations' outcomes by integrating traditional systems with big data technology. 

In addition to these system components, the model incorporates the infrastructure and integration of a recommender system for collaborative filtering, combining multiple sources of differential data with big data technologies. The model's evaluation involved testing and measuring relevant performance parameters that impact the proposed model's efficiency.
