The doctoral thesis focuses on creating a national environmental management model by incorporating risk assessment methods. This model aims to aid in national decision-making processes related to the formulation of laws, policies, and strategies, and to enhance the handling of environmental risks. It also seeks to provide a comprehensive approach to environmental risk assessment, considering often overlooked risk factors such as public perception of environmental risks and the varying environmental risk tendencies of different societal participants, ranging from individuals to organizations and other social groups. 

The proposed national environmental management model, which integrates risk assessment methods, is based on a hybrid approach. It utilizes both qualitative and quantitative risk assessment methods to rank varying environmental and ecological risks, thereby assisting in prioritizing environmental management goals. 

The model's implementation aims to pinpoint critical areas in national environmental management and offer guidance in setting strategic priorities for addressing environmental issues and protection. One of the advantages of this model is its potential to improve a country's environmental quality and public health. This is achieved by prioritizing environmental management goals based on ranked environmental and ecological risks and by involving the public in risk perception, assessment, and environmental decision-making processes. This involvement can strengthen support for the development of transparent and effective national environmental protection policies and strategies.
