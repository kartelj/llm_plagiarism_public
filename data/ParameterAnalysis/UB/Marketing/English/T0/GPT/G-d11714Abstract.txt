This doctoral thesis explores the potential for enhancing the operational performance of non-repetitive manufacturing systems, specifically lead time and delivery reliability, through the application of lean principles. While there are numerous examples of operational performance improvement in repetitive manufacturing systems through lean implementation, the same cannot be said for non-repetitive systems. This disparity is largely due to the lack of a structured and systematized understanding of lean implementation in non-repetitive systems, as well as the absence of a universal framework for its application. 

The primary objective of this research is to expand the knowledge base of lean manufacturing and assess the impact of lean implementation in non-repetitive systems by developing a unique model. This model will be based on an analysis of past experiences and will be experimentally validated in a typical non-repetitive manufacturing company. 

The research reveals that while there is interest in lean implementation in non-repetitive systems, there are also challenges due to the unique characteristics of these systems. To explore the potential for lean implementation in these systems, the thesis reviews scientific literature on lean development, the characteristics of non-repetitive systems, the potential impact of these characteristics on lean implementation, and the potential solutions to these challenges through lean implementation. 

Lean principles were originally developed in Toyota, a repetitive manufacturing system. There are significant differences between repetitive and non-repetitive systems, primarily due to the diverse needs and goals of these systems. These differences can significantly impact how lean is implemented in non-repetitive systems. 

Based on this analysis, a unique model for lean implementation in non-repetitive systems was developed to improve operational performance. The model was designed in two parts: a conceptual framework for implementing lean in non-repetitive systems, and a formalized model for lean implementation. The model was then tested in a typical non-repetitive manufacturing company, first through simulation and then through empirical validation. The results showed that the model can improve lead time and delivery reliability in non-repetitive systems. 

The key contributions of this thesis include the development of a new lean implementation model for non-repetitive systems, the evaluation of this model through simulation and empirical research, a review of current lean research, a critical assessment of previous research on lean implementation in non-repetitive systems, and recommendations for future research.
