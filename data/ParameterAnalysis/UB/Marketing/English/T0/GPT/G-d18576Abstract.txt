In the face of a rapidly changing and competitive market, businesses and their management teams are compelled to swiftly adapt to market shifts. This necessitates a focus on uncovering methods to generate new value and optimize returns on investments in knowledge and technology. Businesses are on the hunt for technologies and knowledge that will revolutionize their operations and bolster their competitiveness on a global scale. Management teams are striving to harness the potential of available technologies, recognizing the importance of integrating ICT and the Internet into their operations to boost productivity, efficiency, and effectiveness. To thrive in this new environment, businesses must overhaul their organizational structures, redefine their strategies and business processes, and establish the necessary technology infrastructure to support business processes efficiently and yield returns on investments. Cloud computing is typically segmented into three areas within the service, platform, and infrastructure (SPI) model, each delivered as a service. This concept extends to the point where someone offering software as a service can utilize platform or infrastructure as a foundational service, creating a cloud within a cloud system. In addition to public and private cloud systems, hybrid cloud systems also exist. If resources in the private cloud are insufficient, expansion into the public cloud can be made to acquire the necessary resources. This paper concentrates on identifying the optimal cloud solution and conducting an analysis and evaluation of business solutions and underlying technologies. The primary contribution of this thesis is a decision support expert system that includes a model for selecting virtualization technologies for constructing cloud systems.
