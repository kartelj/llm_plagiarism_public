Tanja Milić's Ph.D. dissertation, “Strategic and Economic Aspects of Noble Organization Development with the Aim of Achieving Leading Position in Environment,” aims to explore the potential of a new concept that could enhance organizational business and secure long-term prestigious leadership positions. The author proposes the concept of a noble organization as an innovative model for achieving, maintaining, and preserving leadership positions. This model integrates all known concepts related to the new primary purpose of companies, based on noble values in the company's relationship with its customers and stakeholders, as well as the company itself. 

The modern business environment demands the creation of new values and principles that can propel an organization to the top. Rapid advancements in science, technology, and society, along with faster globalization and market integration, consumer sophistication, and the abundance of goods, services, and resources, necessitate a shift in how companies win over customers and stakeholders to secure a leading position. 

The author argues that an organization must focus its efforts on its stakeholders to achieve success. Within these relationships, strategies based on noble values should be implemented. The noble organization concept aims to foster stakeholder commitment, particularly consumer loyalty, ensuring long-term sustainable profit and leadership over other companies. 

The dissertation describes the noble organization, its concept, functioning, and construction. It presents research results related to consumer responses to certain noble aspects of a company and how these aspects influence their loyalty. It also provides research results related to the intrinsic, current characteristics of companies as guidelines for further development towards becoming a noble, leading organization. 

The research results indicate that the general public highly prefers noble values and the concept of a noble organization. A high percentage of respondents expressed positive attitudes and behaviors towards such an organization, suggesting broad acceptance of a potential noble organization in the market. 

The dissertation also presents examples of companies that foster individual aspects of a noble organization with excellent economic results, justifying the development and introduction of the noble organization concept to business systems. The research results show that organizations that value noble values and business aspects more are economically more successful than other organizations. 

The dissertation explores the concept from all aspects of the organization and provides a final image of the noble organization with instructions for its operation and development. The author expects that this dissertation will pave a new path for companies to follow, leading to a significant increase in their revenues and profits, as well as improving the stability of their acquired positions and the quality of life.
