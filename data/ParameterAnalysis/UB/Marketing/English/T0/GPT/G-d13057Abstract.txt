The doctoral thesis research aims to develop the concept of integrated advertising, which is implemented by optimizing performance and generating positive outcomes for both advertisers and the target audience. The thesis explores the impact of various advertising tools and their potential integration to deliver a cohesive message that elicits positive cognitive and emotional responses from the audience. 

Empirical research was conducted in December 2015 at the Faculty of Organizational Sciences, with a sample of 322 second-year students. The study was conducted in two stages. The first stage involved three experiments under controlled laboratory conditions, where participants were exposed to specially adapted audio-visual materials featuring indirect, direct, and integrated advertising. The second stage involved participants completing printed questionnaires to assess their cognitive and emotional responses. 

Cognitive components were assessed using unaided recall, aided recall, and recognition tests, while emotional responses were evaluated through attitude assessment tests regarding different types of advertising and advertised products. 

The empirical research results showed that integrated advertising was the most effective for brand positioning in the audience's minds. Direct advertising also yielded satisfactory results, although slightly less effective than integrated advertising. This could be attributed to the audience's focus on the experimental material, which may not reflect real-world scenarios. 

The study found that audiences had difficulty recalling indirectly advertised brands without specific reminders, suggesting that indirect advertising alone may not yield desired results. However, participants expressed positive attitudes towards indirect advertising, making it a useful tool for overcoming audience resistance that may arise from overexposure to various marketing stimuli. 

These findings underscore the importance of planning advertising primarily in an integrated form, with synergistic messages. In the context of integrated advertising planning, indirect advertising could be prioritized over direct advertising, considering objectives beyond motivating purchases. Positioning in the audience's minds and creating a resonant effect could be a stronger stimulus for long-term investments integrated with other marketing and corporate communication tools.
