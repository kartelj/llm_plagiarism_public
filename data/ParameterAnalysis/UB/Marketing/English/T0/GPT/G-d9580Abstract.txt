The literature review and related research reveal that only a few organizations have successfully identified and transferred project knowledge to future projects. It also shows that project performance is closely tied to specific knowledge elements. Furthermore, it is concluded that knowledge is generated through the learning process in each project and that project knowledge management should be integrated with other project management processes. 

The primary reasons for inefficient project management include organizations focusing more on the immediate task rather than the learning process, inadequate analysis of project success, and the process of documenting project results. Given the lack of scientific support for using project result analysis and project success results, this doctoral dissertation aims to analyze project success and investigate the impact of project success analysis results on knowledge management in a project environment. 

The dissertation includes a synthesis and review of the theoretical foundation for the project success analysis concept, as well as empirical research that leads to the development of an integrated concept for measuring and analyzing project success. This empirical research was carried out in Serbia, with a sample of organizations that focus on project management. 

The research demonstrated a significant link between how knowledge is collected and transferred from previous projects and how we define project success and document project success results. The research also supports the main hypothesis: systematic project success analysis based on measuring project performances contributes to effective and efficient knowledge management in a project environment. 

The research results suggest that a systematic approach to project success analysis can be established, based on the relationship between these elements and the need for their formalization. This concept was applied in a project centered on information systems and technologies. The dissertation also discusses the pros and cons of this concept by analyzing the said project.
