This doctoral thesis research focuses on the evolution of customer relationship management (CRM) within the digital operations of intelligent libraries. The primary issue investigated is the potential for incorporating a CRM system into an integrated library system (ILS) as a means to enhance library interactions with patrons and stakeholders. The research explores a model based on open-source software to implement a CRM model in the digital operations of intelligent libraries, particularly in developing countries. This model comprises an integrated library management system, a CRM system, smart technologies, mobile services, and social media services. An in-depth analysis of research findings in the CRM field is provided. The thesis's core section defines a CRM model and a method for its integration with the ILS. The proposed model outlines the infrastructure and architecture of the CRM system within the digital operations of intelligent libraries. The experimental section of the thesis includes research on the application of CRM concepts and smart technologies in libraries and librarians' readiness to adopt these technologies to enhance customer relationships. Based on the developed model, a system for managing customer relations in an intelligent library is implemented by integrating CRM systems into an ILS. The results support the primary hypothesis that integrating CRM systems into the digital operations of intelligent libraries enhances library operations, optimizes library business processes, and improves patron communication.
