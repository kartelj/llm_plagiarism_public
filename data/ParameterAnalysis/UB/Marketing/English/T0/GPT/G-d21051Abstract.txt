The doctoral research aimed to determine if there was room for the creation or enhancement of existing knowledge management models that would provide a comprehensive understanding of the connections between social capital and knowledge management. This was based on previously identified theoretical findings on the main features of social capital in the context of knowledge management within an organization. A thorough literature analysis revealed a wide range of mutual relationships and influences, laying the groundwork for subsequent empirical research in the nonprofit sector, specifically civil society organizations operating in the European Union and Western Balkans. 

The study not only revealed the primary characteristics of these organizations' internal and external network operations and their knowledge management maturity level, but also validated all theoretical assumptions and identified certain peculiarities. It was found that internal social capital dimensions and elements were more dominant than external ones, suggesting that CSOs are likely more focused on connections stemming from their internal operations. These connections are realized through individuals and the elements that characterize these links, found in relational, cognitive, and nodus dimensions. 

In this context, external social capital, particularly structural forms through which it is established and nurtured, has not been adequately recognized and thus represents an area that needs significant improvement. These peculiarities were also observed when social capital dimensions and elements were compared with knowledge management phases, quality, and maturity. 

The empirical research demonstrated that social capital elements could be incorporated into existing knowledge management models. However, due to limitations, primarily the lack of process-based nature of their functioning, it would be more practical to use project-based knowledge management models. A modified Gasik model was used to clearly illustrate how social capital could be integrated into the knowledge management process. The application of such an integrated knowledge management model was analyzed in the context of its practical usage, suggesting a new paradigm for CSO operations that emphasizes knowledge as a key prerequisite for organizational competitiveness and sustainability.
