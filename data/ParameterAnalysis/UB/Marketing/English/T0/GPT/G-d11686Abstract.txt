Designing an effective logistics network is crucial for efficient supply chain management. It not only gives a company a competitive edge but also helps them adhere to increasingly stringent environmental regulations and navigate business uncertainties. The configuration of a logistics network, including location, facilities, and technology, is a key strategic issue in supply chain management with a significant impact on overall performance. 

This paper presents integrated models of forward and reverse logistics supply, also known as closed-loop supply chains. These models incorporate traditional channels and logistics activities, as well as return channels. The development of such an integrated network can reduce costs across the entire supply chain, increase profits, and help businesses meet legal and environmental regulations. 

The paper posits that operations research methods, based on mathematical models of the phenomena and processes under consideration, can effectively guide decision-making in a logistics system that includes supply and reverse processes. The research aims to contribute to the development of an integrated model of supply logistics and reverse logistics. The challenge is to determine an integrated logistics network that unifies the logistics and reverse logistics supply network, thereby enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of the entire supply chain. 

The dissertation presents five models that address the selection of locations and routes in integrated logistics models of supply and reverse logistics. These problems are tackled using multi-criteria analysis and heuristic methods. One of the models for location selection is solved using the fuzzy AHP method, while four NP-hard problems are solved using heuristic methods. Heuristics based on the Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS) method are developed for mathematical models with one or more objective functions. 

For each of the four models solved using VNS, two algorithms are used. The Variable Neighborhood Descend (VND) is used for local search for all models. Problems with a small number of nodes are solved optimally, and the results obtained with heuristics are compared with the optimal solutions. The optimal solutions are presented to assess and verify the heuristic solutions. 

The research findings indicate that the developed heuristics offer solutions close to optimal, and that the execution time using heuristics is significantly shorter. These results are expected to be useful for researchers studying logistics principles and for practitioners making logistical decisions in production companies.
