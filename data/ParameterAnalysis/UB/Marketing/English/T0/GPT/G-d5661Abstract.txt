This doctoral thesis aims to elucidate the significance of special events both domestically and internationally. Since time immemorial, humans have congregated for various reasons, with such gatherings often being unique and infrequent experiences. These events, often triggered by specific circumstances or at the behest of an individual or governmental group, brought about a sense of excitement and novelty. Today, the leisure and entertainment industry is a focal point, having experienced rapid growth in recent years. It now holds a significant position in the service market, continually generating innovative ways to deliver its services. Event organization agencies have gained global popularity and contribute significantly to business success, profits, and customer satisfaction in the service industry. Concurrently, decision-making is a crucial task for every manager. Decisions are constantly made, not only in relation to traditional management functions but also in the organization of special events. Decision-making is not an isolated management function, but rather a common thread running through all other functions. Managers at all organizational levels are involved in a range of decisions, from operational and tactical to strategic. This thesis will demonstrate how utilizing a group decision-making system can enhance the organization of special events.
