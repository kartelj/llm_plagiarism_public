As international operations become increasingly globalized, the management of intellectual capital is becoming more crucial. It is widely accepted that effective management of intellectual capital is a key factor in an organization's success. Intellectual capital is now seen as a vital resource and operational base for modern organizations. The concept of intellectual capital gained prominence in the early 1920s and has been shown to significantly increase an organization's market value compared to its book value. Unlike tangible assets, which depreciate with use, the proper utilization of intellectual capital can enhance an organization's value. 

Management is expected to identify and leverage opportunities and strengths in the face of drastic environmental changes, while minimizing or eliminating weaknesses. This approach fosters organizational growth and development. Intellectual capital, which includes human capital, structural and relational capital, has both operational and strategic significance for an organization. 

Intellectual capital is not just the knowledge within an organization, but also encompasses staff competencies, organizational structure, business processes, intellectual property, and corporate culture. Both internal and external resources, such as relationships with customers, suppliers, distributors, and other stakeholders, are also crucial. Intellectual capital includes factors not reflected in official financial statements but are vital for creating organizational value. 

The qualitative aspect of intellectual capital is more important than the quantitative, as it creates added value. Intellectual capital is a guide to future dynamic environmental changes. This thesis aims to explore how organizations identify, evaluate, and report intellectual capital. It includes a literature review on intellectual capital and previous studies on its management in organizations. 

The empirical research within the thesis discusses the concept of intellectual capital in Serbian organizations and its importance for financial reporting. The study supports the thesis hypothesis that providing an accurate representation of intellectual capital is a leading performance indicator in the modern age, with the goal of ensuring comprehensive information. 

The final conclusion emphasizes the need for intellectual capital valuation and its inclusion in additional financial statements to accurately reflect an organization's value. The current set of financial statements and quantitative indicators do not adequately capture necessary information, so quantified non-financial elements or descriptive forms can contribute to a clearer understanding of an organization's value and potential.
