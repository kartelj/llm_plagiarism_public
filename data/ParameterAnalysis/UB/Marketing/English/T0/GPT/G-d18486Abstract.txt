The doctoral thesis titled "Planning of marketing communication strategy in cultural-educational institutions for children" presents a systematic compilation of theoretical knowledge. This knowledge is based on prior research on marketing communication strategies in cultural and educational institutions for children. It also includes practical knowledge gained from years of experience working in a children's cultural institution established by the City of Belgrade, and numerous cultural projects for children and youth. 

The research aims to ensure that cultural-educational institutions for children are treated equally with other cultural institutions catering to an older demographic. This is due to the lack of comprehensive literature addressing this issue. The dissertation addresses the problem of insufficient market awareness in children's cultural institutions, which poses a direct threat to their survival and future growth. 

The research methodology included interviews, focus groups, surveys, and case studies. It also involved the analysis of public and private institutions and organizations for children in Serbia and the surrounding region, in comparison to similar institutions outside the region. 

The paper examines the challenges of implementing marketing communication strategies and public relations. It demonstrates how children's institutions plan and execute these strategies. It also presents successful examples for a comprehensive comparison. 

The paper explores the unique aspects of marketing communication in the culture and education sector, and the relationship between non-profit marketing and public relations. It emphasizes the need for children's cultural institutions to secure a competitive position, retain existing patrons, attract potential audiences, and awaken cultural interest among non-existent audiences. 

The lack of a sufficient audience is a barrier to the growth of cultural-educational institutions. However, by using integrated marketing communications and public relations, these institutions can collaborate with schools to foster cultural interest, establish cultural habits, and promote healthier adulthood among children. 

The paper's primary hypothesis, confirmed by theoretical and empirical research, is that the successful market positioning of children's cultural and educational institutions requires the continuous implementation of marketing communication strategies. The research concludes that marketing is essential in the culture and education sector, in its broadest sense. Despite the significant differences between the profit and non-profit sectors, basic marketing concepts, such as providing demanded services/products and facilitating mutually beneficial exchanges, can be applied to both.
