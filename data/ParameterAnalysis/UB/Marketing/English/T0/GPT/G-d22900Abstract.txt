The text suggests that negotiation, a complex and dynamic social process, aims to find a solution that allows all parties involved to achieve their objectives. Establishing a detailed and targeted communication system involves understanding information needs, their significance, communication channels, communication frequency, and effectiveness. The necessity for effective bargaining and awareness of events that could impact value creation confirms the need for communication. This paper investigates and analyzes the impact of marketing communication on business negotiation and value creation. The research problem of this doctoral dissertation is to explore the interactive and interpersonal relationship between marketing communication tools and business negotiation stages as means of creating additional value. Viewing business negotiation as a business philosophy, where marketing communication plays a crucial role, allows the company to realize numerous benefits or create value-added elements. By questioning the target audience, it aids in measuring the impact of marketing communications and hence their influence on business negotiations. In this regard, empirical research was conducted to assess the contribution of individual communication channels and the stages of the negotiation process. Linear regression analyses were also performed on the total sample, divided into buyers and sellers.
