The dissertation focuses on the potential for creating a flexible and adaptable model for measuring process performance. Modern organizational management is largely about managing processes, and the organization's success is tied to the success of these processes. Key performance indicators are used to gauge the success of a process. The research includes an examination of the relationship between top-level organizational goals and process performance indicators in companies that have adopted a process approach. The study also explores ways to enhance the flexibility and adaptability of the process performance measurement system, including a review and analysis of existing models and the creation of a unique, adaptable model. This development includes defining the model's structure, elements, and interdependencies, applying it in a practical setting, and refining it based on the results. The main hypothesis, which is supported by the dissertation, is that formalizing the interdependencies between top-level organizational goals and key process performance indicators can enhance the flexibility and adaptability of business performance measurement systems. A comprehensive literature review led to a scientific description and comparative analysis of existing process performance measurement models. This was followed by the proposal of a new GPI (Goal, Process, Indicator) model, which allows for the direct identification of interdependencies between top-level goals and process performance indicators and offers a degree of flexibility and adaptability. A case study was then conducted, and the findings were used to refine the previously conceptualized model. The research results and the proposed GPI model provide a foundation for improved and simplified performance management, as well as future research in this field.
