This thesis proposal delves into the support for operational production planning in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), with a particular focus on scheduling activities, which are the most intricate planning issues at the operational level. SMEs are the primary type of enterprises in Serbia and the European Union (EU-28), especially in the manufacturing sector. The most prevalent forms of production in these enterprises are Make-to-Order (MTO) production and production organization according to the process. The Job Shop scheduling problem is a crucial part of short-term production planning in these enterprises. 

Given that operational production planning is closely tied to the transformation of raw materials and semi-manufactured goods, which adds value, it is essential to manage manufacturing resources effectively in the production process. The thesis proposal provides an overview of fundamental theoretical concepts such as SMEs, support for SMEs, management in SMEs, production planning, and resource management. 

The process of operational production planning is defined in terms of the activities it includes. Production scheduling problems, which involve scheduling products to machines and determining time slots for manufacturing activities, are identified as common issues in operational production planning. The goal of an effective schedule arises from the capacity constraints of production resources. Therefore, improving scheduling activities is crucial for an efficient operational planning process that aligns with the needs of a specific enterprise. 

The proposal presents typical problems in operational production planning activities, along with models, methods, and techniques used to solve these problems. Some of these problems are classified as NP-hard problems of operational research, making finding the optimal schedule a complex task. Hence, the heuristic approach for solving these problems is given special attention in the literature. 

The literature review identifies relevant papers based on quantitative and qualitative analyses, recognizing scientific achievements in the field. A critical review of the literature justifies the proposal of the new research project presented in this dissertation. 

The practical aspects of the problem are examined, assuming that operational planning of production in Serbian SMEs is not adequately developed. The survey results from 79 companies show a limited understanding and application of modern operations management methods in operational planning and resource management. Therefore, SMEs require appropriate support in operational planning and resource management. 

The dissertation proposes a model of support for operational production planning and resource management in SMEs, consisting of six phases. A new research project defines the scheduling problem in small-scale production, typical for single product production. This problem, known as a Dual Resource Constrained Flexible Job Shop, is modeled in the MatLab numerical computing environment. The NSGA-II multi-objective genetic algorithm metaheuristic is used to solve the problem, with criteria functions makespan and JIT. The application of the metaheuristics, which significantly improved DRCFJS problem solving, is further presented in the dissertation.
