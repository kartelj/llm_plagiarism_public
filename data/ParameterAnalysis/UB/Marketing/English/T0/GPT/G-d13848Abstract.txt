The creation and advancement of new products and services can rejuvenate existing industries and establish entirely new ones, making the development and commercialization of new technologies crucial for the global economy. Entrepreneurship, often seen as a catalyst for economic and social growth, involves the formation of new companies, ideas, products, and services. Recently, social entrepreneurship has gained attention from researchers and practitioners due to its impact on job creation and societal health. 

Technological entrepreneurship begins with assessing the market value of new discoveries and technologies and aligning them with current or potential market needs. This process aims to convert market opportunities into commercialized products, services, or new ventures. Teams that form to develop these new technological ventures, often referred to as "startups," play a significant role. Startups are temporary organizations created to find a sustainable and scalable business model. They are typically characterized by high dynamism, growth orientation, profit-seeking, and the creation of new market values. 

Many entrepreneurs who develop new, technology-based products and services within their startups possess extensive technological knowledge and skills. However, they often neglect business orientation, which can lead to failure. This dissertation examines marketing and marketing orientation as part of business orientation in the development process of technological entrepreneurial ventures. 

The goal is to develop a comprehensive model of how marketing orientation impacts the success of technological entrepreneurial ventures in the startup phase. Marketing orientation is defined as an organizational culture that efficiently fosters behavior within the organization and creates superior value for customers, a prerequisite for successful business. 

The dissertation analyzes the impact of marketing orientation on the development process of technological startups through competition orientation, customer orientation, and interfunctional coordination. It also examines the concept of entrepreneurial marketing through components of entrepreneurial orientation: innovativeness, proactiveness, risk-taking, autonomy, and competitive aggressiveness. 

The dissertation includes an analysis of environmental impact, competitiveness level, and the role of mentorship in the development process of technological startups. It also examines the personal characteristics of successful entrepreneurs. 

Measuring the performance of technological startups, unlike established companies and large corporations, presents a significant challenge for both theory and practice. Based on a review of existing scientific literature and qualitative research conducted within a specific target audience, 13 development goals for technological startups have been identified. 

Quantitative research has generated four success factors for the development process: success of idea and concept, success of value proposition, success of value exchange, and success of business model. The research results highlight the significant role and impact of several marketing and entrepreneurial orientation components on the success of the development process of technological startups. They also explain the impact of environmental competitiveness and mentorship on the development process. The final part of the research identifies the personal characteristics of successful founders of technological startups.
