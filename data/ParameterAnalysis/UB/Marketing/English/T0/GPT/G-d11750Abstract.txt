The aim of this doctoral thesis is to explore and elucidate how business intelligence systems can be enhanced through group decision-making processes. In the realm of business intelligence, the term 'intelligence' primarily refers to the reporting or information designed to aid business decision-making. Viewed in this light, business intelligence aids in navigating new scenarios and aids in swift and precise problem-solving. However, it diverges from the conventional psychological interpretation of the term, as it does not pertain to an individual's personal ability, but rather to a technological solution implemented by a corporation. Business intelligence should not be seen as a product or system, but rather as an architecture and an amalgamation of integrated operational and decision-supporting applications. It embodies the utilization of all data potentials, hence the corporate information and knowledge aimed at making superior and suitable business decisions, and subsequently the capacity to pinpoint new business opportunities. Assisting an individual decision-maker is a crucial activity for any successful corporate management. However, as business system operations become increasingly complex and the accountability for decisions grows, it becomes necessary to consider the diverse ideas and perspectives of team members, as well as the accumulated knowledge, for group decision-making. Furthermore, it is a mathematically established truth that the collective knowledge of all team members invariably surpasses the knowledge of any single member, provided there is effective communication and resource sharing among team members. Conversely, the need for quality enhancement in group decision-making is clear. This is a recurring research interest for scholars with substantial practical and theoretical expertise. As such, the issues of knowledge acquisition, storage, and distribution will receive special focus and consideration; knowledge will underpin all sections of the thesis and serve as the linking element of the paper.
