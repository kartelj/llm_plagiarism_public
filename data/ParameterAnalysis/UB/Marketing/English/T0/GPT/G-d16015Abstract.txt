As the Republic of Serbia moves closer to joining the European Union, significant changes are anticipated, particularly in the health-social system. It's becoming increasingly clear that Serbia cannot solely depend on state health systems due to financial and organizational constraints. Therefore, private health institutions are expected to play a crucial role in Serbia's health system. Despite the presence of several such institutions, this sector is still developing and is expected to thrive dynamically in the future. The success of these private health institutions will largely hinge on effective marketing and sales strategies, as well as the ability to anticipate challenges in the competitive landscape. Defining and developing a model of interdependence between sales and marketing activities, and their impact on brand positioning and development, is a priority management task for these private health institutions. This paper aims to provide basic recommendations based on past experiences and scientific research projects.
