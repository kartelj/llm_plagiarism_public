This study aims to highlight the significance of the behavioral approach in decision-making processes within modern finance. Behavioral finance, a relatively new field of study, examines the impact of emotional, cognitive, and social factors on financial decision-making. It is an interdisciplinary study rooted in psychology and applied to contemporary finance. The goal is to underscore the need for practical application of behavioral finance, which, backed by psychology, elucidates how decision-makers arrive at their choices. It also scrutinizes behavior in business decision-making, bridging the gap between traditional finance and reality, and the methods financial actors employ in decision-making, taking into account all personal feelings and human limitations. Behavioral theory does not dismiss emotions from human behavior or downplay the potent influence of emotions on decision-making processes in modern finance. Behavioral finance enhances understanding of investor behavior, managers, and events in a complex and uncertain business environment unfolding in financial markets. To assess the presence and extent of behavioral finance concepts in Serbia and Montenegro, a survey and three focus group interviews with financial managers were conducted. The focus groups aimed to develop a value orientation scale for financial managers, later used in the survey to gauge the prevalence of behavioral finance concepts in our financial institutions. Twenty-three managers from Montenegro participated in three groups discussing manager performances, decision-making, value system, and behavioral finance. The discussions led to the creation of a seven-point grading scale for manager value orientations, comprising 15 values and dependent on two factors: result-oriented values and moral values. The survey aimed to identify the predominant decision-making styles of financial managers and examine the role of emotional competence and value orientations in shaping these styles. The findings suggest that managers are not fully aware of behavioral finance theory concepts and do not apply the knowledge these theories provide. Despite consensus on the importance of personality traits for success in this field, professional selection is rare, and when it occurs, these traits are not verified. The results indicate that managers typically rely on rational decision-making, contradicting behavioral finance theory's claim that humans are not always rational. It's important to note that our environment discourages emotions and encourages rational thinking â€“ a notion long discarded in economically advanced countries. However, the research findings reveal that the formation of rational, intuitive, and evasive decision-making styles depends on emotional competence and values, partially validating behavioral finance theory's assertion that factors like personality traits, value system, previous experience, emotions, attitudes, motivation, among others, influence decision-making.
