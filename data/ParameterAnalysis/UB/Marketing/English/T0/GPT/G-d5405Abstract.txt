Despite the implementation of quality models in the past two decades, health care organizations continue to experience nonconformities and errors. This suggests that the quality of these organizations and their services remains subpar. The quality models implemented vary, even though they are based on the same standard, regulation, or concept, leading to differing results. The variation in the structure of these models and their outcomes can be attributed to the translation process of the guideline into the implemented model for quality assurance or improvement. This often overlooks non-clinical processes that are crucial for the quality of health care organizations and their services. 

Information regarding the quality of various physicians or health care organizations, as well as the outcomes of different treatment or diagnosis methods, is often unavailable, insufficient, or not presented in a form that facilitates decision-making. Patients have limited access to information about the quality or outcome of different treatments or providers. Health care quality reports are primarily designed to aid payers in choosing health plans and improving quality among plans and providers, rather than enhancing patient awareness and choice. Consequently, high-quality health care organizations are not rewarded with increased patient patronage, and patients lack the necessary information to make informed choices. 

This highlights two main issues in achieving quality in health care organizations and reaping the benefits of quality achievement. The first issue stems from the transformation of general standards, guidelines, and regulations into a specific model for a particular health care organization, which often neglects non-health care processes. The second issue arises from reporting the achieved quality, as the abundance of data on parameters hinders patients' decision-making and complicates comparisons between health care organizations. 

Viewing health care organization as a business system through the Anatomical Structure Model developed at the Faculty of Organizational Science allows for the identification of all elements that directly or indirectly affect the quality of health care services. This perspective results in a Model for Quality Improvement of Health Care Business Systems, which serves as a bridge between certain policies, standards, guidelines, or concepts, and a concrete model for quality assurance, control, and management of health care organizations. This model includes a graphical, verbal, and mathematical component, enabling the calculation of the quality of each element of the health care business system and facilitating quality comparisons between health care business systems using this model. The model's application in two primary health care business systems demonstrated its positive impact on quality improvement.
