Stochastic programming, a subset of operational research, explores methods to integrate uncertainty into decision-making processes, acknowledging that decision-makers may not always have all necessary information at hand. The primary challenge in applying stochastic programming stems from the uncertainty of model parameters and the fact that the optimal solution is defined for the deterministic equivalent (double) of the original problem. Another issue is assessing the quality of a specific deterministic equivalent from the standpoint of the criterion function value, which can be random, and from the probability of satisfying stochastic constraints. Stochastic programming is utilized in various fields, including production planning, supply chains, logistics, transportation, portfolio management, marketing, finance, and more. 

Three common strategies for solving stochastic programming problems are stochastic optimization, robust optimization, and chance constrained programming, which form the foundation of all research in this optimization field. Robust optimization is a conservative strategy that focuses on the worst-case scenario by defining a deterministic equivalent of the original problem that eliminates all model uncertainty. Chance constrained programming is a method that addresses uncertainty in the model's constraint parameters and employs various techniques to solve these problems. 

This approach assumes that a stochastic and uncertain constraint must be satisfied with a predetermined probability. The need to describe constraints in a way that the predefined probability of satisfying constraints is actually a risk that the solution obtained won't be satisfied, and which the decision-maker is willing to accept, is the reason for developing and applying such an approach. The most challenging aspect of the chance constraint approach is tractability, primarily related to the ability to find the appropriate probability distributions of the stochastic parameters. 

However, all these stochastic programming approaches are complementary in solving optimization problems with uncertainty, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. This dissertation's research field investigates different methods of handling uncertainty in mathematical models, i.e., developing a new approach to solving stochastic programming models. The dissertation's basic premise is that the real-life problem of stochastic programming can be effectively solved by combining classic deterministic optimization and simulation. 

The research aims to contribute to the field of stochastic programming by developing a new approach to solving weakly structured problems. Specifically, the dissertation proposes a new original method: the iterative optimization-simulation approach. This approach involves an optimization phase, where the deterministic equivalent of the original problem is solved to optimality, and a simulation phase, where the probability of satisfying constraints is checked using simulation. Each deterministic equivalent represents a new scenario, which is checked using simulation. If the decision-maker is not satisfied with the result, a new scenario of the original stochastic problem with new deterministic values will be defined. The accumulated experience from checking scenarios is used to consider and formulate heuristics as simple rules for scenario generation. 

The primary research goal is to use the optimal solutions achieved through this approach's implementation to solving stochastic models as sound managerial decisions that will facilitate the goals' realization and implementation of the stochastic models in real-life problems. The dissertation's most significant contribution is defining a new approach to solving stochastic optimization problems, i.e., devising an efficient method to solve stochastic models using a simulation approach. Additionally, a new scenario will be proposed in solving stochastic optimization models, simplifying the application of the appropriate algorithms in solving these models and implementing them in the real world.
