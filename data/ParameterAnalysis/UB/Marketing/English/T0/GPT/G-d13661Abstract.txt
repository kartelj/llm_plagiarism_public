The pharmaceutical industry is currently experiencing significant changes and uncertainties, a trend that is being observed globally. This industry has evolved from traditional medicine production to a modern industry, marked by significant events such as the rise of large pharmaceutical companies in the 1950s, the thalidomide disaster in the 1960s, new management strategies in the 1970s, global integration and capital concentration in the 1990s, and the rapid development of biotechnology in the early 21st century. These dynamic factors have propelled the industry forward, preventing stagnation.

This research focuses on managing strategic changes in the pharmaceutical industry, particularly in Serbia, considering the industry's global development dynamics and the fact that strategic management and change management have not been adequately implemented in this sector in Serbia. The goal of this paper is to analyze the pharmaceutical sector, its changes, and to establish a suitable framework for managing strategic changes in Serbia's pharmaceutical industry.

The paper defines strategic changes and presents key models of strategic change management, with a special focus on Kotter's model. It also analyzes the fundamental elements and characteristics of the healthcare and pharmaceutical industry globally and in Serbia. Understanding the industry requires knowledge of its key mechanisms and processes, including the importance of research and development, marketing and sales, and understanding the costs and financial strategies of pharmaceutical companies.

The paper also examines trends and challenges in the global pharmaceutical industry that significantly influence the development of Serbia's pharmaceutical industry. The healthcare and pharmaceutical market in Serbia have unique characteristics that are analyzed separately. European integration also brings significant changes to this strategically important field in the country.

The paper also explores opportunities for further growth and development of the industry in Serbia and includes empirical research demonstrating the need for a systematic approach to improving change management in Serbia's pharmaceutical industry. Based on the findings, a model for managing strategic changes in Serbia's pharmaceutical industry has been proposed to enhance company operations and the efficiency of Serbia's entire health sector.
