The successful transition of Central and Eastern Europe, including Serbia, hinges on the privatization of state and socially owned enterprises. This process has shown that restructuring these enterprises before privatization is necessary. Various restructuring activities aim to enhance company performance, efficiency, and shareholder value. This dissertation focuses on a restructuring methodology centered on key value drivers, including the definition of value, measuring value creation, and value creation models. The goal is to help management understand how to create value through restructuring decisions related to operations, financing, and investments. To create value, management should adopt strategies that increase return on invested capital, reduce risk, or a combination of both. The success of restructuring is gauged by the created value, which is the difference in equity value before and after restructuring. The equity value of a company is the present value of its discounted future cash flows, dependent on the value of future cash flows and the weighted average cost of capital. To boost equity value, it's crucial to increase cash flows by raising revenues, cutting costs, and increasing asset turnover, while also reducing business risk and, consequently, the cost of capital. The right method of equity sale can influence the realized equity price of companies undergoing restructuring when their equity is up for sale to strategic and financial investors. This paper also examines public tenders and auctions as methods of selling equity of socially and state-owned enterprises undergoing restructuring and privatization. The research and analyses presented in this dissertation support the hypothesis that company restructuring can increase their value and prepare them for sale to potential investors. The dissertation also validates the feasibility of a restructuring model based on key value drivers that can be applied to any company. Lastly, an analysis of Serbia's privatization results confirms that selling socially and state-owned enterprises is the most efficient privatization model in the late transition stage.
