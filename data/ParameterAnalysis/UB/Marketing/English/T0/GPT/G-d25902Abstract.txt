The doctoral thesis research focuses on the creation of crowdsourcing models in smart cities, utilizing the Internet of Things (IoT) and mobile technologies. The thesis primarily explores the potential of integrating crowdsourcing, IoT, and mobile technologies to enhance smart city services. The research delves into the analysis, definition, and execution of various crowdsourcing models to improve living standards in smart cities. 

The thesis primarily investigates the readiness of citizens to adopt crowdsourcing services in a smart city. The initial phase of the research aims to identify those crowdsourcing services, based on IoT and mobile technologies, that will stimulate citizen participation. The research is centered on cities that have not yet fully adopted smart city standards. 

The method used to assess citizens' readiness involved analyzing crowdsourcing models like crowd wisdom, crowdfunding, crowdvoting, and crowdsensing, and their application in areas such as traffic, environmental conservation, utility services, and health. Data was collected over two years in Belgrade, using a survey of 210 citizens. 

The findings suggest that citizens are prepared to embrace crowdsourcing services based on crowdfunding, crowdvoting, and crowd wisdom models. The results also show a keen interest in environmental conservation and public transportation. These findings not only highlight priority services for implementation but also provide a solid foundation for initiating other smart city projects. 

The thesis introduces the development of the crowdsourcing Smart Belgrade platform, designed to encourage citizens to collaborate and achieve shared goals through collective intelligence and an organized online community. The platform allows citizens to stay informed about current issues in ecology, utility services, and public transportation, and participate in problem-solving, initiate new projects, post relevant information, and report city issues. 

The platform also includes a crowdvoting service for voting on initiatives. The model proposed in this dissertation aims to enhance citizen information and participation in a smart city. The model's effectiveness and usefulness were evaluated and tested in the thesis, confirming the main hypothesis that the development and use of crowdsourcing models based on IoT and mobile technologies enhance citizen participation in information collection, dissemination, and usage in a smart city.
