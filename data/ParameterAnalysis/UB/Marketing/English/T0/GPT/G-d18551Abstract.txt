Modern information and communication technologies have paved the way for the growth of teaching and learning opportunities through the use of innovative methods and tools, enhancing the quality of e-education. Furthermore, smart learning environments and the Internet of Things have facilitated shifts in teaching and learning strategies in both traditional and virtual community settings. However, many new concepts such as collective intelligence and collaborative learning are yet to be clearly defined theoretically and methodologically within the realm of e-education and smart learning environments. One such concept is crowdsourcing, which leverages the collective knowledge and skills of a group to accomplish a task. Crowdsourcing has been shown to be a successful innovation in education, scientific research, and problem-solving within education. This dissertation posits and demonstrates that the creation and application of crowdsourcing models in smart learning environments enhance educational performance and quality, boost student motivation, and improve the overall outcomes of the educational process. In the experimental section of this doctoral dissertation, three research projects were conducted in two higher education institutions to validate the suggested crowdsourcing models in various educational settings. The evaluation results affirmed the significant potential of the proposed models, demonstrating students' readiness to cooperate, their problem-solving abilities, their capacity to produce quality solutions, and their high level of self-organization.
