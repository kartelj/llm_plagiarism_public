This thesis focuses on enhancing the Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) by incorporating Ivanovic distance (I-distance) and resampling to establish the limits of virtual weights in the Global Assurance Region DEA model (GAR DEA). The study delves into the challenges of gauging the efficiency of intricate systems. It also provides a comprehensive review of the most commonly employed efficiency evaluation methods, highlighting their specific pros and cons. The concept of weight restrictions in DEA is further explained. DEA is widely used to estimate the relative efficiency of complex entities by utilizing various inputs to yield different outputs. The freedom in weight determination often results in a large number of entities being perceived as efficient, thereby reducing the method's discriminatory power. Moreover, some entities are evaluated based on a limited set of indicators, while others are overlooked. The new model addresses the shortcomings of traditional weight restriction models, where weight limits are determined by expert subjective evaluation. By using the I-distance, a data-driven significance assessment is achieved for each indicator involved in estimating relative efficiency. The proposed model has proven to be consistent and applicable to both profit and non-profit systems, as evidenced by its use in scientific papers for efficiency evaluation in the banking and health sectors. The model's successful application in two-stage DEA analysis is also demonstrated, particularly in situations where entities have indicators that are not directly under their control.
