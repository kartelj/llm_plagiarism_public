In essence, this PhD thesis, apart from the introduction and general conclusions with suggestions for future research, is divided into three distinct yet closely linked sections, each concluding with its own summary. The first section (chapters 2 to 5) covers definitions of quality indicators, human capital and social capital, and their interrelationships. The concept of human capital is used to articulate the value of our human abilities. Despite numerous attempts to standardize the definition and categorize human capital, no global consensus has been reached on a universally applicable model for measuring and calculating it. This issue impacts all major fields, including science. It has become clear that any study of human capital is virtually meaningless without considering the concept of social capital, as the two are inextricably linked. Human capital includes an individual's knowledge, skills, competences, experience, intellect, talents, know-how, expertise, etc., while social capital, which is less tangible, is embedded in the structure of relationships among individuals. It can be seen as the only form of capital that grows when shared, originating from family ties, friendships, professional connections, and other relationships. Quality indicators are qualitative and/or quantitative data on a studied phenomenon, allowing for analysis of its evolution and assessment of whether quality targets are met, directions established, and appropriate decisions and actions taken. They can also help identify areas requiring further study and investigation by tracking changes over time and highlighting potential quality concerns related to specific stakeholders or interested parties. To link quality indicators with critical success factors, they should always be centered around the needs and expectations of the main stakeholders and interested parties. The second section introduces and clarifies concepts with increasing potential to influence approaches to managing human and social capital in the future. It challenges traditional views on management by incorporating theories from other fields (virtual, technical, history, nature) into the realm of social complexity, providing a new paradigm based on complexity theory. This approach transcends pure linearity and has a socially responsible nature, contributing to sustainable development in the long term and serving as a strategic alignment model for employee behavior at the organizational level. This section offers innovative solutions for various governance and management systems (environmental, HR, marketing, social responsibility, etc.) beyond their primary actions, concluding how policy makers can use this paradigm shift to achieve stronger stakeholder engagement, particularly in science, education, and knowledge production. This process created favorable conditions for the emergence of quality indicators for the human and social capital of the scientific community. The third section begins with a description of how the quality indicators model for this research was developed. To succeed, it was necessary to find entirely new data sources, as using new indicators with outdated data formats would not result in a breakthrough. The new data should inform policy makers about changes in understandings, behaviors, beliefs, and attitudes. This required a shift from aggregated, macro statistics to more detailed data, tailored to the circumstances of the scientific community. The research methodology (model implementation) involved data collection in two directions: questionnaires were sent to Serbian scientists both in Serbia and abroad, followed by an analysis of their CVs and a broader search for their data in all publicly available sources (from Google to social network profiles). The research sample included 444 PhDs (202 in Serbia and 242 abroad), and all three basic hypotheses were confirmed. The most significant findings include the fact that Serbian PhDs abroad publish over four times as many papers, around six times as many papers in journals with an impact factor, are cited over 15 times more, in 14 times more documents, have a 13 times higher overall impact factor value, over five times higher ResearchGate score, and around 5.5 times higher h-index value than their counterparts in Serbia. They also tend to have more co-authors - on average, they have four times as many co-authors as PhDs in Serbia. The study also revealed that the Serbian scientific diaspora has an advantage in how they perceive work in science and research, the role of management in it, lifelong learning in the context of international mobility, and the languages they speak. Serbian PhDs worldwide also believe more strongly that people's consciousness is evolving faster than ever before due to the impact of science and technology. Conversely, members of the scientific community in Serbia, according to this sample, are characterized by a higher commitment to the interests of the wider community they identify with, including greater respect for traditions and heritage. PhDs in Serbia, compared to those abroad, view "succession planning" as a more important factor in their work, are more willing to consider the experiences of their ancestors when making important decisions, and generally feel more fearful of the possibility that current trends of our civilization - especially regarding consumption levels, and despite all the scientific capacities we have developed, may lead humanity towards some form of collapse.
