The construction sector is vast and intricate, with contractors carrying out a significant portion of the work. As such, the success of these projects largely hinges on their skills and qualifications. This makes the selection of a competent contractor a crucial decision in every project. To ensure this is done effectively, it's advisable to carry out a prequalification process to assess their suitability before the final selection stage. This issue is a classic multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) problem, hence the use of the AHP method. This dissertation aims to present a model to assist the Libyan Central Committee of Tendering (hereafter referred to as the Committee) in prequalifying potential contractors. The model, which was tested on four Serbian construction firms, comprises four criteria: experience, technical capability, managerial capability, and human capability. A sensitivity analysis was conducted to verify the model's robustness. The conclusion is that the proposed model provides a dependable framework for the Committee when making such prioritization decisions. Furthermore, the model is efficient, produces satisfactory results, and aids in making sound decisions in the contractor prequalification process, thereby enhancing the integrity and transparency of the bid awarding processes in Libya.
