Financial institutions can enhance their effectiveness, safety, and profitability both domestically and globally through the comprehensive management of financial risks. This text provides a brief overview of the role, significance, and implications of modern financial risk management activities, with a particular focus on financial risk models. Financial institutions, including deposit and non-deposit entities, as well as financial intermediaries and service providers, face various risks such as credit, interest rate, solvency, liquidity, market, operational, and technological risks. The accumulation of these risks can lead to widespread contagion, potentially resulting in significant losses and even bankruptcy for the financial institution. These financial risks are diverse and complex, and can lead to disproportionately large losses when they interact with other risks, thereby continually amplifying their impact. It is crucial for financial institutions to employ risk management strategies and information and communication technologies to identify, measure, and adjust all existing forms of uncertainty. They can use new methods, financial derivatives, securitization, and other tools to manage this uncertainty. This enables financial institutions to engage in activities that offer an acceptable return relative to the risk, thereby creating and enhancing value for their owners. Changes in the regulation of financial institutions, particularly in the banking sector with the introduction of Basel II and Basel III, have significantly influenced these developments. These regulations tie the amount of capital to the expected level of credit risk and other risks, such as market, operational, or liquidity risk.
