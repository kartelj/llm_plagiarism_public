Despite implementing quality models over the past two decades, health care organizations still grapple with errors and nonconformities, pointing to a persistent issue with service quality. Even though these models are built on the same standard, regulation, or concept, the outcomes they produce vary due to differences in their structure and implementation process. 

One possible reason for this divergence lies in the translation of guidelines into an applied model for quality assurance or improvement, often bypassing non-clinical processes which are crucial for maintaining overall quality of health care services. 

Furthermore, patients lack adequate or accessible information on the quality of different health care providers, treatments, or diagnoses, which hinders their ability to make informed decisions. Although health care quality reports are produced, they serve more to aid payers in selecting health plans and improving quality among plans and providers, rather than fostering patient awareness and choice. Consequently, high-quality healthcare organizations don't necessarily attract more patients, and patients are often ill-informed about their choices. 

These issues indicate two fundamental problems in maximizing quality and reaping its benefits in health care organizations. The first encompasses the limitations in transforming general standards and guidelines into a practical model that inadvertently ignores non-healthcare processes. The second revolves around the complexity and oversaturation of data in quality achievement reports, which confound patients' decision-making and comparison of different health care organizations. 

To address these issues, we can view healthcare as a business system using the Anatomical Structure Model developed by the Faculty of Organizational Science. This approach facilitates the identification and structuring of all elements indirectly or directly impacting the quality of healthcare services. This understanding culminates in the Model for Quality Improvement of Health Care Business Systems, connecting policies, standards, and guidelines to a practical model for quality assurance, control, and management. 

This model, which includes graphical, verbal, and mathematical parts, enables the calculation and comparison of the quality of each component of the healthcare system. After its application in two primary healthcare systems, the model demonstrated its potential to enhance the quality of healthcare business systems.
