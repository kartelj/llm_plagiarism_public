Negotiating is a multifaceted and dynamic social process that aims to find a solution that allows each involved party to meet their goals. Creating a comprehensive and targeted communication system involves considering the types of information required, their significance, the medium of communication, how often communication takes place, and its effectiveness. The need for communication is driven by the need for information vital for effective negotiations and for awareness of events which could impact value creation. This paper explores the impact of marketing communication on business negotiation and value creation processes. The research problem of this thesis is to examine the reciprocal relationship between marketing communication tools and business negotiation stages as tools for creating added value. Viewing business negotiation as a business philosophy, where marketing communication is of paramount importance, allows a company to enjoy various benefits or create added value components. Querying the target audience enables the measurement of the effect of marketing communications, and therefore also their impact on business negotiations. In this regard, empirical research was conducted to investigate the contributions of individual communication channels, the stages of the negotiation process, and linear regression analyses were carried out on the total sample, dividing it into buyers and sellers.
