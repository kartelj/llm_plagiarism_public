The aim of the doctoral study was to determine whether there was room for creation of a new, or enhancement of existing knowledge management models. These models would provide a comprehensive perspective on the connections between social capital and knowledge management, based on previously established theories about the primary aspects of social capital in the context of knowledge management in an organization. A significant range of mutual relationships and influences were unearthed through literary analysis which then set the foundation for empirical research in the nonprofit sector. This specifically pertained to the civil society organizations operating in the European Union and the Western Balkans. The study revealed not just the pivotal traits of these organizations' internal and external network operations and their level of knowledge management maturity, but also confirmed all theoretical suppositions and identified certain particularities. The study noted a clear prevalence of internal social capital's dimensions and elements over the external, suggesting the likelihood of Civil Society Organisations (CSOs) leaning more towards relationships originating from their internal operations. This is seen through individual linkages characterized through cognitive, relational and hub dimensions. Conversely, external social capital, especially the structural forms for its establishment and nurturance, were not adequately appreciated, thus necessitates further significant improvement. These peculiarities were also observed when social capital's dimensions and elements were correlated with knowledge management stages, quality, and maturity. Empirical research has indicated that social capital elements can be incorporated into existing knowledge management models. However, due to their limitations, primarily their lack of a process-based operation, using project-based models might be more feasible. A modified version of the Gasik model was applied to illustrate how social capital could be integrated into the knowledge management process. The practical application of this integrated knowledge management model was explored. This could potentially introduce a new working paradigm for CSOs with the emphasis on knowledge as a crucial requirement for organizational competition and sustainment.
