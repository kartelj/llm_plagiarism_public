This study aims to enhance understanding of quality costing in present practices and ascertain the need to define a quality cost model within the framework of a process-systemic approach. It involves a review of 186 corporations from various sectors, all of which are acquainted with quality costs. Three indicators to gauge familiarity with quality costs were utilized to construct the research database. Findings illustrate significant comprehension of the significance of quality costs, together with a growing trend of businesses managing these expenses. Influential factors in quality cost management systems were identified, and correlations amongst these factors were examined. From the companies' perspective, specific requirements of ISO 9001:2015 standard, with a significant relationship with quality cost management variables were chosen based on their importance. The study outcomes emphasize the necessity of defining a quality cost model in a process-systemic approach context. Consequently, the PAF model is applied at the process level to suggest a cost model, which views quality cost elements in relation to outputs of a process. The model takes into account the effect of one process's outputs on another's quality. In the proposed model, quality costs are calculated at two instances: the present and the expected, post-intervention points. Appropriate control or enhancement measures are then determined based on nonconformity analysis causes and the PAF model's assumption, where preventive and appraisal activities decrease failure costs and overall quality costs. The model ensures that the difference in total quality costs at the two observed instances is the highest possible for the process under study. This value is used to prioritize processes for implementing defined control or enhancement measures, with the PAF model assuming that higher costs imply lower quality, therefore, a higher need for intervention.
