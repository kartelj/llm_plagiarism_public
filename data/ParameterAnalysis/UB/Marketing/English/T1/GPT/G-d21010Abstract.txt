Education technology systems, known as Open Badges, can acknowledge the skills, accomplishments, qualities, and interests of individuals or groups. Recently, there has been an increase in software systems based on the Open Badges Infrastructure (OBI), which support various teaching, learning, and badge-awarding practices. However, their usability can significantly vary in specific educational settings, posing a challenge for educators when choosing a system for particular educational use. The objective of this research is to introduce usability metrics, which are overall and unique to the OBI-compliant systems, to aid in choosing the appropriate educational technology. The primary outcome of this research is a methodological framework that includes standard general usability metrics along with technology-specific usability metrics developed during the research. The suggested approach was tested in an empirical study using a mixed research approach. The study's findings indicate the proposed approach's success in the given context. The metrics proved to be complementary and satisfactorily distinguished the evaluated systems. Furthermore, a qualitative evaluation illuminated the key usability issues in the assessed systems. The approach may be implemented in various educational environments since the proposed metrics are easy to gather and interpret.
