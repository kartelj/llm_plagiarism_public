Following a comprehensive review of existing literature and conducting a series of related research, it has become evident that only a few organizations have achieved success in consistently identifying and transferring project knowledge to their future ventures. It is also observed that project performance is intensely linked with specific elements of knowledge. Moreover, the study concludes that knowledge creation is resultant of a learning process within each project and calls for an integration of project knowledge management with other project management processes. Major obstacles to efficient project management include a greater emphasis on the immediate task rather than learning process, insufficient analysis of project success, and inappropriate methods of documenting project results. This doctoral dissertation addresses the gap in scientific understanding of project result analysis and project success results, focusing on project success analysis and the impact of project success result analysis on knowledge management within a project environment. This work includes both a synthesis and review of theoretical basis for project success analysis, along with empirical research, establishing a combined concept for measuring and analyzing project success. The empirical research was carried out on a group of project management-focused organizations in Serbia, demonstrating a significant correlation between the methods used for collecting and transferring knowledge from previous projects and the definition of project success and documentation of project success results. The empirical results also support the primary hypothesis that systematic project success analysis, based on measuring project performances, enhances efficacy and efficiency of knowledge management within a project environment. A closer examination of the research results reveals the possibility of establishing a systematic approach to project success analysis considering the correlation between various elements and the necessity of their formalization. The proposed concept was applied in a technology-based project on information systems. The dissertation further highlights the strengths and weaknesses of this concept by evaluating the aforementioned project.
