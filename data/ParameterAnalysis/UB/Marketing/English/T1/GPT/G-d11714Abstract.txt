This doctoral thesis investigates methods to optimize operational efficiency in non-repetitive manufacturing systems, specifically focusing on lead time and delivery reliability, via lean implementation. There is a wealth of evidence demonstrating improved operational performance through the application of lean principles in repetitive manufacturing systems where it was initially conceived. However, current research highlights an emerging interest in adapting this approach to non-repetitive systems, despite the lesser quantity of success cases compared to repetitive systems.

One significant hindrance to achieving this is the lack of a structured understanding and systematic application of lean implementation in non-repetitive systems. Additionally, there is an absence of a universal framework that effectively considers all the unique features of the specific manufacturing environment and the lean principles.

The primary objective of this research is to enhance our expertise in lean manufacturing and assess the impact of lean implementation on non-repetitive systems by developing a novel model specifically designed for them. This model, based on past experiences, will be experimentally verified within a typical non-repetitive manufacturing company.

Challenges arising from the specificities of non-repetitive systems hinder a straightforward application of lean principles developed in repetitive systems. To navigate this, the thesis thoroughly reviews the relevant literature regarding lean development, non-repetitive systems characteristics, potential challenges presented by these characteristics to lean implementation, and opportunities to address these issues.

Lean, which was initially conceived in Toyota's repetitive manufacturing system, can be impacted by the distinguishing features between repetitive and non-repetitive systems, which derive from different needs, goals, and strategies. Consequently, a customized approach is required to integrate lean principles effectively.

Based on this comprehensive exploration, a novel model to implement lean principles in non-repetitive systems, thereby enhancing their operational efficiency, has been developed. This model took shape in two stages - the first sought to conceptualize a framework for implementing lean principles in non-repetitive systems, while the second entailed formalizing this model by operationalizing customized lean principles in a series of steps aimed at improving operational performance.

The model was tested, first in simulations and then in practical application within a typical non-repetitive system company, yielding improvements in lead time and delivery reliability - the key dimensions of operational performance. Thus, this research's significant contributions include the design and assessment of a new lean implementation model suited to non-repetitive systems, a critical review of related existing research, and recommendations for future research directions.
