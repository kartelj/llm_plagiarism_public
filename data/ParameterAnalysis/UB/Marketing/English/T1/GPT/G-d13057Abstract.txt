The goal of his doctoral research is to devise an integrated advertising strategy that enhances performance and delivers favorable results for advertisers and their target market. The dissertation probes the impacts of various advertising tools and the potential for their amalgamation to convey a cohesive message that sparks positive intellectual and emotional responses from the audience. The empirical study was completed in December 2015 at the Department of Organizational Sciences, with 322 second-year students as respondents. The survey consisted of two sequential parts. Initially, three experiments were conducted within a controlled laboratory environment, involving the exposure of respondents to specifically tailored audiovisual material, manifesting indirect, direct, and integrated advertising. Subsequently, participants completed questionnaires in print to measure their intellectual and emotional responses. Recall and recognition tests were utilized to evaluate cognitive factors, while affective responses were gauged through surveys assessing the respondents' attitudes towards the various kinds of advertising and the advertised goods. According to the collected data concerning all three advertising forms (indirect, direct and integrated), integrated advertising proved to possess the most potential in brand positioning. Direct advertising yielded satisfactory outcomes, though slightly lower than integrated advertising, which is attributed to the audience's focus on the experimental material rather than the real-life scenario. The findings revealed that the audience poorly recalls indirectly advertised brands without specific prompts, implying the ineffectiveness of this form of advertising when used in isolation. However, respondents held positive views towards indirect advertising, rendering it a useful tool to subdue resistance arising from overexposure to marketing stimuli. This data strongly advocates for the primary use of integrative advertising combined with synergistic messages. Based on the results, indirect advertising could be of primary importance in the planning of integrated advertising, considering other objectives besides inciting a purchase. Securing a position in the minds of the target audience and resonating strongly may provide more substantial boosts in the case of long-term investments integrated with other marketing and corporate communication tools.
