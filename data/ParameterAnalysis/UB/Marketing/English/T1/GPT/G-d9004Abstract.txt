The effective management of financial risks allows financial institutions to operate more securely, successfully, and lucratively both locally and globally. This work offers a succinct overview of the role, significance and repercussions of implementing contemporary financial risk management techniques, focusing particular attention upon financial risk models. All types of financial institutions and intermediaries, whether deposit-based or not, coupled with service providers, undertake various risks such as credit, solvency, liquidity, market, operational, and technological risks. The combination of these risks can potentially lead to the widespread distribution of loss, pushing the financial institution to the brink of bankruptcy. As most financial risks are varied and intricate, they can cause disproportional, amplified losses when interacted with other risks. Therefore, it is crucial for financial institutions to employ risk management strategies, supplemented by ICT systems, allowing them to identify, measure and modify (if required) all current forms of uncertainty. The utilization of innovative techniques and financial instruments such as financial derivatives, securitization and others, help in achieving this. Hence, financial institutions are enabled to engage in ventures that offer a fair return in relation to the risk, securing a business environment that fosters and enhances value for its owners. Changes in the regulation of financial institutions, notably Basel II and Basel III, have majorly influenced these modifications, linking the quantum of tied capital with credit risk levels and other risks such as market, operational or liquidity risk.
