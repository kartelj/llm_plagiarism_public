The doctoral thesis, entitled "Brand Management Model for Establishing Long-Term Customer Relationships," discusses frameworks used by companies for successful brand and customer portfolio management, as well as the integration of brand management and long-term customer relationship management. The layout of the chapters is provided at the beginning, followed by a brief explanation of each chapter's contents. The second chapter delves into the concept and history of branding, focusing specifically on brand architecture and knowledge, and emphasizes the brand resonance model within the discussion on the brand management process. It also defines terms such as brand value, added value, and brand financial value. 

The third chapter explores relationship management, defining the term, discussing CRM databases and the Payne model of customer relationship management. It also talks about Customer Relationship Management models, segmentation, sub-segmentation, and CRM categorization. The fourth chapter centers around company-customer relationship management and its related models. 

The fifth chapter goes into creating a specific brand management model for establishing long-term customer relationships, focusing on a customer-centric branding model and Suzanne Fernie's model of brand and customer relationships. This chapter also opens a discussion on loyalty and customer satisfaction. 

The sixth chapter outlines the points of intersection between brand management and long-term customer relationship management, providing an in-depth analysis and comparison of both concepts. The focus is on the segmentation process and customer categorization as a preface to a brand-new concept, "relationship branding." An integral model is presented at the end of the chapter, along with research results and hypothesis testing. This chapter concludes with the implications of the thesis for scientists and managers and proposed directions for further research. The final section of the paper lists its references and contributions.
