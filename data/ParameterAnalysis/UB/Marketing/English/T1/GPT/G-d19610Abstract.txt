This PhD research paper discusses the enhancement of customer relationship management (CRM) within smart libraries' digital commerce. The central issue addressed is the potential integration of the CRM system into an inclusive library system (ILS) as a path to better interaction with library patrons and interested parties. The research explores the implementation of a CRM model in smart libraries' digital commerce, specifically catering to developing countries, utilizing an open-source software model. This model features an integrated library management system, CRM system, advanced technologies, mobile service, and social media components. Detailed CRM research findings are presented. The thesis primarily outlines a CRM model and a merging method with an ILS. The proposed model showcases the CRM system's infrastructure and architecture within smart libraries' digital commerce. In the practical research segment, studies were conducted to understand the application of CRM concepts and smart technologies in libraries, and librarian's readiness to adopt such technology to enhance customer relations. The model developed helped to implement a system that manages customer relations in a smart library, via CRM systems integration into an ILS. The resulting evidence affirmed the leading hypothesis that incorporating CRM systems in smart libraries' digital commerce enhances library operation efficiency, optimizes business processes, and promotes better engagement with customers.
