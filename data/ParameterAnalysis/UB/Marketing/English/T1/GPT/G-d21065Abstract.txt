This dissertation focuses on the enhancement of Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) through the establishment of a methodological structure, which incorporates the use of Ivanovic distance (I-distance) and resampling to shape the limitations of virtual weights in the Global Assurance Region DEA model (GAR DEA). The paper closely scrutinizes the challenges associated with measuring the efficiency of complex systems. Furthermore, it provides a comprehensive review of the most commonly employed methods for efficiency evaluation, while shedding light on their respective strengths and weaknesses. Additionally, the concept of weight restrictions in DEA is discussed in detail. Essentially, DEA serves as a primary tool for estimating the relative efficiency of complex entities by utilizing various inputs to generate diverse outputs. However, the freedom in determining the weights often leads to a substantial number of entities being perceived as efficient, consequently reducing the method's discriminatory capacity. Likewise, it results in certain entities being evaluated only based on a minor portion of their indicators, while others are overlooked. The innovated model addresses these deficiencies by using the I-distance to provide data-derived, significance evaluation for each indicator used in estimating relative efficiency. This updated model has proven its reliability and applicability in both profit and non-profit oriented systems, as evidenced by its use in published research papers analyzing the efficiency of banking and healthcare systems. Moreover, the model's successful application in two-stage DEA analysis underlines its effectiveness, particularly in situations where certain indicators are not within the direct control of the entity.
