The focus of this PhD thesis is to advance the approach for building and assessing composite indicators, developed by experts from the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the Joint Research Center (JRC). Composite indicators are measures created by merging individual indicators that quantify various elements of the examined multi-faceted concept. Decision makers increasingly utilize these composite indicators for ranking and assessing entities on diverse subjects. The OECD-JRC approach offers valuable guidance for structuring the complex procedure of creating the methodological outline of the composite indicator. Nevertheless, the steps involving the weighting method as well as the robustness and sensitivity analysis continue to garner interest. The objective of the suggested weighting method in this PhD thesis is to establish a weight system that enhances the constancy of the metric, gauged by the sum of standard deviation of relative contributions of indicators. The bootstrap IvanoviÄ‡ distance (I-distance) is suggested to determine the model constraints, while the augmented metaheuristics Scatter Search (eSS) is employed to solve the identified optimization issue. This new method considers the consistency of the composite indicator during the process of determining the weighting system and offers a data-driven weight system that reduces intuition-dependency and addresses the absence of robustness analysis in most construction and assessment procedures of composite indicators. As per the experimental outcomes, it is demonstrated that this proposed weighting method can be effectively used in constructing and evaluating composite indicators.
