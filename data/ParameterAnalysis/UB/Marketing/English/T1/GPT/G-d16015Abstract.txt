As Serbia edges closer to joining the European Union, it is expected that the health and social system will undergo significant changes. It's clear that the country can no longer solely depend on public health facilities due to financial and organizational reasons. Therefore, private healthcare institutions will likely play a substantial role in Serbia's health system. Although the private health sector in Serbia is still growing, it promises a dynamic future. The success of these private institutions largely depends on sound marketing and sales strategies and their ability to predict and navigate various challenges within the competitive marketplace. The task of defining a development model that balances sales and marketing activities for the growth and branding position is vital for Serbia's private health institutions. This work aims to provide basic guidelines based on past experiences and scientific research projects.
