Business intelligence serves as a crucial component of decision-making processes, essential for successful management and operations within any organization. Its core attributes include: information extraction, data warehousing and large-scale data analysis. Recent studies reveal that valuable insights can be gather from unstructured data, enhancing decision-making in all areas of management. The successful creation of a universal environment that integrates all data extractors and decision-making points is pivotal for the effective implementation of the Smart Grid concept. Innovations in Smart Grid technologies are revolutionizing the electricity industry, impacting all aspects of the supply chain while transforming market dynamics and business models. For comprehensive energy systems adopting Smart Grid technologies, infrastructures for business intelligence and performance management are a must. This dissertation presents a business intelligence model specifically designed for transmission system and electricity market operator’s B2B e-business, which focuses on electricity market activity monitoring through necessary information and data flows. The creation of a business intelligence solution tailored for electric power systems requires a well-structured methodology and an architecture outlining the essential elements of a data warehouse. Using Kimball’s modelling approach as a guide, this dissertation proposes a methodology for designing a business intelligence system that minimizes reliance on predefined objects within the SAP environment. The 'bottom-up' approach was used, along with a modified dimension life-cycle adapted for Accelerated SAP for Business Warehouse methodology. This dissertation presents the results of the applied methodology, resulting in a business intelligence system for electricity market activity monitoring. The proposed solution was evaluated in the Public Enterprise "Elektromreža Srbije". Findings indicate that business intelligence solutions can enhance market management efficiency in data-intensive environments and can effectively be utilized across various business segments. Moreover, comparative analysis results suggest potential methodologies for building robust business intelligence systems.
