This study aims to highlight the significance of a behavioral approach in decision making within the sphere of modern finance. Behavioral finance, a fairly recent field of study, examines the impact of emotional, cognitive, and social factors on financial decision making. It is an interdisciplinary area of study wherein principles of psychology are applied to contemporary finance. The study seeks to underscore the necessity of the practical application of behavioral finance, which draws on psychology to elucidate how decision makers arrive at their choices. It also takes into account behavior in business-related decision making, tying together traditional finance and real-world scenarios and explores how financial actors make decisions, taking into consideration personal feelings and human shortcomings. It does not disregard the effect of emotions on human behavior nor does it downplay its considerable impact on financial decision-making processes. 

Through behavioral finance, we can better comprehend the behaviour of investors, managers, and events within the intricate and unpredictable world of finance. A survey and three focused group interviews involving financial managers were conducted to gauge the extent to which behavioral finance principles are utilized in Serbia and Montenegro. The focus group's aim was to create a value orientation scale for financial managers, used later in the survey to ascertain the prevalence of behavioral finance concepts within our financial institution practices. Twenty-three managers from Montenegro took part in the discussions, touching upon manager performance, decision-making, value system, and behavioral finance. 

A seven-point rating scale for manager value orientations was drawn up, founded on the conversations, consisting of 15 values, contingent upon two factors: result-orientated and moral values. The survey aimed to identify what decision-making styles predominantly used by the financial managers and delve into the importance of emotional competence and value orientations in such decision styles. 

Based on the research findings and focus groups, it was concluded that managers are not fully cognizant of behavioral finance principles and undervalue their practical application. While there's consensus regarding the significance of personality traits in achieving success in the field, minimal professional employment selection is present. If it does occur, these traits are rarely screened. 

The data indicates that managers often resort to rational decision-making styles, conflicting with the behavioral finance theory which asserts that humans are not always rational when making decisions. It's important to remember that in our society, the commonly held belief is that there's no place for emotions, and rational thinking is highly encouraged â€“ a concept long abandoned in economically advanced nations. Regardless, the research findings show that the formation of rational, intuitive, and evasive decision-making styles are influenced by emotional competence and values. This, to an extent, supports the behavioral finance theory, which emphasizes the impact of personality traits, value systems, past experience, emotions, motivations, and other factors on decision making.
