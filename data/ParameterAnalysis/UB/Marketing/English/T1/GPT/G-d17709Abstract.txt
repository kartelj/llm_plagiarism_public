This study aims to present, examine, and identify various types of real options and investigate their impact on the creation of shareholder value. From the obtained insights, a novel technique for equity valuation is proposed for corporations with high risk and flexibility. This study offers a comprehensive view of modern strategy theories and links them to the generation of shareholder value. Implementing certain strategies provides the company with a variety of real options. A literature review was used to identify different indicators of flexibility and uncertainty, suggesting the potential presence of real options. These indicators were applied to classify corporations and identify those with valuable real options. Additionally, financial performance measures for companies with high flexibility and uncertainty were computed and their characteristics outlined. This PhD thesis scrutinizes existing stock pricing models. Based on the collected data, excess returns are tied to risk, real options, and basic strategies. Panel data analysis is utilized in this study. Various definitions of growth option were applied to test the sensitivity of the proposed method. This method is validated by comparing the predicted and actual excess return results. While real options indicators are important for understanding the risk-return relationship, it's observed that the market is more cautious when valuing these options. The cost-leadership strategy enhances the excess return for investors.
