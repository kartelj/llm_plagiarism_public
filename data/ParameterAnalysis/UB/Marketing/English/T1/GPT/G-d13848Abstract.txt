Creating new products and services can reinvigorate existing industries and open up entirely new ones, highlighting the significant impact that the development and commercialization of novel technologies can have on the global economy. In this context, entrepreneurship has been recognized as a critical driver of economic and social progress, leading to the creation of new businesses, ideas, products, and services. 

Recent years have seen an increasing interest in the concept of social entrepreneurship among researchers and practitioners. They acknowledge its crucial role not only in job creation but also in fostering a healthy society. 

Technological entrepreneurship begins with assessing the market value of new discoveries and technologies and aligning them with existing or potential market needs. The ultimate goal is to convert market opportunities into commercialized products, services, or new ventures. Entrepreneurs who establish teams for such ventures play a vital role in this process.

The term 'startup' quantifies this form of organization. Startups are temporary entities aiming to discover a sustainable and scalable business model. They primarily operate within innovation and novel technology sectors. Their key characteristics include high dynamism, growth and profit orientation, and the ability to create new market values.

However, many entrepreneurs tend to overlook the business aspect due to their focus on technology and new product or service development. This imbalance often leads to failure.

This study focuses on the role of marketing and market orientation in the development process of technological entrepreneurial ventures. It aims to establish a comprehensive model that demonstrates market orientation's influence on technological entrepreneurial ventures' success during the startup phase.

Marketing orientation, as an organizational culture, effectively influences organizational behavior and enhances customer value, a prerequisite for successful ventures. This study investigates the impact of competition orientation, customer orientation, and interfunctional coordination on technological startupsâ€™ development process. 

It also examines the concept of entrepreneurial marketing - spanning components like innovativeness, proactiveness, risk-taking, autonomy, and competitive aggressiveness. The study also investigates environmental impact, competitiveness levels, and the role of mentorship in the development of technological startups.

Apart from these aspects, the study scrutinizes the personal traits of successful entrepreneurs. Assessing the performance of technological startups, unlike established businesses and large corporations, diverges from traditional success metrics, posing a significant theoretical and practical challenge.

Based on a review of existing scientific literature and qualitative research from a specific target audience, 13 developmental goals for technological startups have been recognized.

In this study, quantitative research reveals four crucial success factors for these ventures: idea and concept success, value proposition success, value exchange success, and business model success.

The study concludes by highlighting the crucial role and influence of several marketing and entrepreneurial orientation factors on the development process's success. It also recognizes the impact of environment competitiveness and mentorship. Lastly, the personal characteristics of successful founders of technological startups are identified.
