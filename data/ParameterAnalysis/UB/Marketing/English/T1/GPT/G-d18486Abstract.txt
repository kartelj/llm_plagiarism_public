The doctoral thesis titled "Planning marketing communication strategies in child-focused cultural-educational institutions" compiles theoretical knowledge developed from prior research on marketing communication strategies applied in both culture and education-related institutions for children. The practical knowledge encapsulated comes from many years of employment in a children's cultural institution established by the city of Belgrade, and various cultural projects designed for children and young people. The intent behind this investigation is to achieve equal consideration of children's cultural-educational institutions with other cultural establishments meant for older demographics, considering that no comprehensive literature exists that approaches this issue. The dissertation addresses the problem of undervaluing market mentality in children's cultural organizations, a neglect that can jeopardize the institutions' survival and future growth. This work employed interviews, focus groups, surveys, and case studies; analyzed both public and private child-serving institutions and organizations in and outside of Serbia; and compared them with analogous establishments in other regions. The thesis looks into the difficulties of implementing marketing communication strategies and public relations, and demonstrates how these institutions strategize and apply marketing communications. It offers successful real-world examples for a thorough comparison, and scrutinizes the characteristics of marketing communication in culture and education, and the necessary correlation between non-profit marketing and public relations. Children's cultural institutions must secure a competitive standing, maintain their existing consumers, attract potential audiences, and also meet the cultural demands of otherwise overlooked demographics. The inadequate audience size presents a barrier to these institutions' success. By implementing integrated marketing communications and public relations, these venues, in partnership with schools, can instill cultural appreciation in children, foster cultural habits, and contribute to a healthier adulthood. This work supports the primary hypothesis arguing that the constant application of marketing communication strategies is crucial for the successful market positioning of child-centered cultural-educational institutions. It concludes that marketing, broadly construed, is indispensable in culture and education. Despite significant differences between profit-seeking and non-profit sectors, fundamental marketing notions can apply in both. These include supplying services/products desired by users/customers and engaging in mutually beneficial exchanges.
