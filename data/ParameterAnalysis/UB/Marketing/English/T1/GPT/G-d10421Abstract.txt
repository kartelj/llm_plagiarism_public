As global business operations become increasingly intertwined, managing intellectual capital effectively has become crucial. It is broadly accepted today that effective management of intellectual capital is the cornerstone of an organization's success. Intellectual capital, as a principal resource and operational base, is of paramount importance to modern organizations. Since the 1920s, the concept of intellectual capital has gained prominence. Studying this concept can significantly enhance an organization's market value in relation to its book value. Unlike physical assets, which depreciate over time with use, the careful application of intellectual capital adds to an organization's worth. Management is anticipated to identify and exploit opportunities and strengths in a changing environment while minimizing or eliminating weaknesses to promote the organization's growth and development. Intellectual capital has both operational and strategic importance for an organization. Today, organizations are increasingly interested in managing their intellectual capital.

Intellectual capital, a form of intangible asset, is comprised of human, structural, and relational capital. It is not just about the available knowledge within an organization but also encompasses staff competencies, organizational structure, business practices, intellectual property, and corporate culture. Both internal and external resources, including relation with customers, suppliers, distributors, and stakeholders, also play a key role. Intellectual capital includes factors that aren't reflected in official financial statements but are crucial in creating organizational values. Using intellectual capital effectively increases an organization's value with the qualitative dimension being more critical in creating added value.

Intellectual capital is a future-oriented indicator considering the dynamic changes in the environment. This thesis aims to explore how organizations identify, evaluate, and report intellectual capital. It includes a review of pertinent literature on intellectual capital and a summary of past studies on the practice of intellectual capital management in organizations. The empirical research, conducted in Serbia, discusses the concept and importance of intellectual capital in organizations, particularly for financial reporting. 

The study confirms the hypothesis that developing a sound intellectual capital position is a leading performance indicator in the modern age, aiming to ensure thorough information. The thesis concludes that valuing intellectual capital and presenting it in supplemental financial statements is necessary for accurately reflecting an organization's value. The extant financial statement and quantitative indicators do not comprehensively present the necessary information. Therefore, quantified non-financial elements or descriptive forms help paint a clearer picture of an organization's total value and potential.
