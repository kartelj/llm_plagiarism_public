Increasingly, organizations are expanding their operations into the global market. The rise of globalization and international business has spurred the extensive internationalization of human resource management. It's now widely recognized that effective human resource management is a cornerstone for the success of multinational corporations. 

This doctoral dissertation delves into the challenges multinational corporations face when managing diverse human resources in an international context. Key issues and primary activities of international human resource management, particularly staffing and performance management, are defined and elaborated upon. 

Multinational corporations must navigate various challenges while conducting business globally, one of the most crucial being the decision to standardize human resource management activities. These corporations often have to tailor their policies, practices, and procedures to suit the environment of each foreign country where they operate. 

The aim of this dissertation is to unveil how multinational corporations conduct staffing and performance management activities. It also examines to what extent they seek to standardize human resource management policies across headquarters and all international subsidiaries, or in other words, how successful they are in importing these policies from headquarters to foreign subsidiaries. 

The dissertation also comprises a literature review on international human resource management, and the results of research focused on the standardization of human resource management practices in multinational corporations. This empirical research was carried out in foreign multinational subsidiaries based in Serbia, intent on determining the extent that multinational corporations standardize their human resource management policies in their Serbian subsidiaries. It also identifies the key factors that influence the transmission of these policies from headquarters to subsidiaries. 

The analysis of the survey data collected from the Serbian subsidiaries revealed that most companies standardize their human resource management policies and performance management, but not their staffing practices. Drawing from these research findings, a novel approach to human resource management was suggested. This aims to guide multinational corporations to make informed decisions regarding whether to harmonize their human resource management practices with their headquartersâ€™ or to adapt them to Serbian local practices.
