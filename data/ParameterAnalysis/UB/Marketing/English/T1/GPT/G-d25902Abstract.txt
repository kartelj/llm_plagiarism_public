The PhD research explored the creation of crowdsourcing models in IoT and mobile technology powered smart cities. The study aimed to investigate the prospective uses of crowdsourcing, IoT, and mobile technologies in enhancing smart city services. Various crowdsourcing models were analysed, defined, and implemented to better life quality in smart cities, with an emphasis on measuring citizen readiness for the usage of crowdsourcing services. 

In the initial stage, the research aimed to identify those crowdsourcing services, facilitated by IoT and mobile technology, which would actively engage the citizens. Cities lagging in alignment with smart city norms were the primary focus. The methodology for examining citizen readiness incorporated an analysis of various crowdsourcing models like crowd wisdom, crowdfunding, crowdsensing, and crowdvoting in several sectors like traffic, environmental protection, utilities, and health. 

Data was collected from a survey conducted in Belgrade, over two years, involving 210 citizens. The findings suggested a robust readiness among citizens to adopt crowdsourcing services, especially ones based on crowdfunding, crowdvoting, and crowd wisdom models. Further, citizens displayed interest in environmental initiatives (crowdfunding services supporting solar energy and environmental conservation) and public transportation (crowdvoting and crowd wisdom services enhancing public transport).

These results could facilitate the implementation of priority services and spur other smart city projects. The conclusions and methodology could also guide project selection in other cities. The development of a crowdsourcing platform, 'Smart Belgrade', is showcased in the thesis. This platform encourages collective intelligence and team working among citizens through a structured online community.

Citizens can stay informed about current ecological, utility services, and public transportation issues via the platform. Registered users can partake in problem-solving, suggest new initiatives, post data collected from suitable mobile devices, and report city problems. Additionally, a crowdvoting service for initiative voting was introduced on the platform. The proposed model aims to boost citizen involvement in information collection, dissemination, and usage in a smart city. 

The study tested the system and measured relevant parameters to evaluate the model's effectiveness and functionality. The results supported the primary hypothesis that crowdsourcing models, powered by IoT and mobile technologies, enhance citizen involvement in the smart city information process.
