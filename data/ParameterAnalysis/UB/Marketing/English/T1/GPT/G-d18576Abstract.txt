The dynamic and competitive market landscape requires companies and their management to quickly adjust to market shifts and concentrate on finding avenues to add new value and increase the return on investments in technology and knowledge. They are constantly seeking innovative technologies and knowledge that can revolutionize their business operations and enhance their global market competitiveness. Aware of the need to integrate ICT and the Internet into their business, the management is attempting to utilize the potential technologies available to augment productivity, efficiency, and effectiveness. For businesses to thrive in this new environment, they need to adapt their organizational structures, modify their strategies, overhaul their business processes, and develop a robust technology infrastructure for supporting efficient business operations and promising investment returns. 

Cloud computing is commonly bifurcated into three service segments - service, platform, and infrastructure (SPI), all of which are provided as services. A software provider, for example, could utilize the platform or infrastructure as a fundamental service, creating a layered cloud system. Besides the standard public and private cloud systems, hybrid cloud models also exist. If the resources of a private cloud are insufficient, an expansion to the public cloud can be considered to avail the needed resources. This paper is dedicated to the discovery of an optimal cloud solution through the analysis and evaluation of business solutions and the supporting technologies. A key contribution of the thesis is a decision support expert system that encompasses a model for choosing appropriate virtualization technologies for constructing cloud systems.
