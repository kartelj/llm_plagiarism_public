Designing an effective logistics network forms a suitable base for streamlined supply chain management. It also gives a company a competitive edge, enabling it to meet growing environmental regulations and business uncertainties. The configuration of a logistics network, such as the placement of facilities and use of technology, is a critical strategic consideration in supply chain management due to its substantial impact on overall performance. The research in this paper revolves around integrated models of forward and reverse logistics supply, or closed-loop supply chains. These networks combine traditional channels and activities with a return channel.

The creation of an integrated logistics network can lead to cost savings across the supply chain, increased profits, and compliance with environmental laws and regulations. This study posits that operations research methods tied to mathematical models can assist in decision making in logistics systems, including supply and reverse processes.

The goal is to develop a unified model of supply logistics and reverse logistics, tying together the logistics network and the reverse logistics supply to augment efficiency and effectiveness across the whole supply chain. Five models illustrating the selection of locations and routes in integrated logistics systems are presented in this study. The problems are resolved using multi-criteria analysis and heuristic methods, including the fuzzy AHP method for one model. For complex problems that are NP hard, heuristic methods rooted in the Variable neighborhood search (VNS) method were used. Two algorithms were used for each of the four models solved via VNS, and the Variable neighborhood descend (VND) method was used for local searches for all models.

Issues involving fewer nodes were optimally solved, and the heuristic-generated outcomes were compared with optimal solutions. These optimal solutions were also analyzed to validate heuristic-based results. The research shows that the heuristic methods developed closely approximate optimal solutions and that they operate significantly faster. We anticipate that these findings will benefit not only researchers exploring logistics principles and science but practitioners making logistical decisions in production firms as well.
