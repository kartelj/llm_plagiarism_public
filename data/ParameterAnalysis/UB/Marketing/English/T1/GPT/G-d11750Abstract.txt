The primary aim of this PhD thesis is to shed light on potential enhancements to the system of business intelligence through the implementation of a group decision-making process. Business intelligence in its true essence is designed to support business decisions, providing vital data reports or information. In doing so, it aids in navigating unforeseen situations and expedites accurate problem resolutions. Unlike the traditional psychological implication of the term 'intelligence', in the business context, it is not a personal attribute but a technological solution employed by corporations.

Business intelligence should neither be perceived as a product or a system. In reality, it constitutes an architectural design composed of integrated operative and decision-supporting applications. Business intelligence embodies the exploitation of all data reserves - corporate information and knowledge - with the ultimate goal of enhancing business decision-making, thereby identifying novel business opportunities.

The reinforcement to an individual decision-maker plays a pivotal role in effective corporate management. As business operations and functionalities progressively become complex, greater responsibility is placed on decision-making. Such circumstances necessitate consideration of diverse ideas and perspectives from team members, exploiting the collective knowledge for group decision-making. Notably, it is a mathematically established fact that the cumulative knowledge of team members always supersedes any individualâ€™s knowledge, provided there is effective communication and resource sharing.

Additionally, the stringent demand for quality improvement in group decision-making is undeniable. This remains an ongoing subject for researchers with extensive practical and theoretical experience. Therefore, concerns regarding knowledge procurement, storage, and distribution will be given prime importance. Knowledge will form the foundation of all the thesis chapters and serve as the binding element of the entire paper.
