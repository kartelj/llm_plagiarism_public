The size and complexity of the construction industry are enormous, with contractors handling a significant part of the work. Therefore, the successful execution of construction projects relies heavily on the abilities and qualifications of these contractors. As such, the process of selecting a qualified contractor is a crucial task which involves making important decisions for each project. To facilitate this process, it is advisable to conduct a prequalification assessment of potential contractors before reaching the bidding stage where the final selection is made. This problem corresponds to a typical multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) scenario, so the AHP method was used. The objective of this thesis is to put forth a model to assist the Libyan Central Tendering Committee (hereinafter referred to as the Committee) in prequalifying potential future contractors. The model, which was tested on four Serbian construction companies, includes four criteria: experience, technical capability, managerial capability, and human capability. A sensitivity assessment was conducted to validate the model's robustness. Our conclusion is that the proposed model can provide a dependable structure for the Committee when making such crucial prioritization choices. Moreover, the model was found to be effective and produced satisfactory results, thereby enhancing the credibility and transparency of bidding processes in Libya by leading to informed decision-making in the contractor prequalification process.
