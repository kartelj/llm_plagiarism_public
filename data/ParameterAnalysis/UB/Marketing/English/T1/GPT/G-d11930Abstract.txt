Tanja Milić's Ph.D. dissertation, “Strategic and Economic Aspects of Noble Organization Development with the Aim of Achieving Leading Position in Environment,” analyzes the potential to develop a unique approach to improve an organization’s operations and secure long-lasting leading positions, through the use of the innovative concept of a noble organization. The author proposes that having a noble organization will benefit the business by integrating all currently existing core concepts related to a company's primary aims, centered on modern and noble values, and their relationship with their customers and stakeholders. This relates to creating fresh values that will push an organization to the top despite the accelerated pace of scientific, technological, and societal changes.

The author underscores how these changes, which have been fostered by human actions, the expanding array of goods, services, and resources, and companies' growing focus on ensuring stakeholder satisfaction, affect globalization and market integration. To become market leaders, organizations should foster meaningful interactions with their stakeholders through strategies rooted in noble values.

The noble organization concept purports to build stakeholder commitment (especially from consumers) ensuring a sustained, reputable leading position. This engagement is intended to fully implement the noble organization's objective, ensuring the long-term sustainability of profits. It emphasizes values driven by spirituality, nobility, and attentiveness to the needs of major stakeholders.

The author expounds on these elements of the noble organization in her dissertation, which includes achieving high-quality, stable, and steady growth despite economic challenges. Her research findings and analysis provide insights into the potential of noble organizations regarding both consumer behavior and the characteristics of various companies. The data collected suggests a favorable reception of the noble organization concept, pointing to a promising foundation for the integration of this concept into existing business systems.

Lastly, the author presents the final image of a noble organization, offering guidance for its operations and development, with the hope that this innovative approach will multiply company profits, enhance sustainability and stability, and ultimately improve societal wellbeing.
