This doctoral research thesis explores the creation of a big data-based smart library model and its related technologies and services. The key research issue addressed is the formulation of a big data infrastructure and smart library services that provide intelligent search and recommendation options within library content. The paper scrutinizes the feasibility of merging these developed models into a smart educational setting to enhance the educational process's quality. The thesis introduces a smart library model, an essential component of the education system designed to enhance the quality and comprehensiveness of learning resources and boost users' motivation via content-aware suggestions. The thesis explores the potential application of a big data system for gathering, analyzing, processing, visualizing data from various sources, and integrating such data into the smart library. The smart library's development aim is to enhance the library's operational process and present users with innovative search and content utilization methods. The paper covers the prospects of integrating a big data solution within smart libraries as part of an ongoing learning procedure, intending to optimize library operations' outcomes by combining traditional systems with big data technology. The model also factoring in the infrastructure and merger of a recommendation system for collaborative filtering, using big data technologies to incorporate differentiated data from multiple sources. The model's performance parameters impacting its efficiency were evaluated, tested, and measured.
