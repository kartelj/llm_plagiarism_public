This doctoral thesis aims to clarify the role of special events both nationally and globally. Historically, humans have congregated on special occasions, turning them into unique, seldom events that stir excitement and intrigue. These occasions often arose due to specific situations, at the behest of an individual or a governmental group. Today, particular emphasis is placed on the leisure and entertainment industry. Over the recent years, this industry has seen rapid development and innovation in its service offerings. It now occupies a distinct position in the service market. 

Around the world, professional event management agencies are making significant contributions to business success, profits, and customer satisfaction in the service industry. All aspects of management, from operational to strategic, involve decision-making, which is not just an isolated function of management but a common thread weaving through all its functions. Managers at all organizational levels partake in various decision-making processes, collectively contributing to the organization of special events. Through this thesis, I aim to show how collaborative decision-making can enhance the organization of such events.
