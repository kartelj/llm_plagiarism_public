Historically, the primary purpose of business organizations worldwide was perceived as profit generation. However, over the past few decades, this belief has been challenged as numerous profit-making organizations have gone bankrupt. This raises the following question: "What is essential for an organization's sustainability?" Previous research investigating this question proposed several models that could aid in developing a sustainable business strategy. The objective of this doctoral dissertation was to formulate a new sustainability model for organizations, utilizing multi-criteria decision-making models to support strategic decisions. The research process was undertaken in several stages. The initial stage involved a literature review for applicable strategic decision-making indicators. The subsequent step involved examining the indicators utilized in top-performing global companies' sustainability annual reports. After selecting 150 indicators, sorted into strategic perspectives based on the Balanced Scorecard, strategic decision-makers conducted the research. The acquired data was analyzed using PCA and Varimax rotation to identify correlations and potential group formation among the investigated indicators. The analysis discovered that eight perspectives could account for 69.38% of the total sample. The most descriptive indicators for these perspectives were selected based on these findings. The next phase employed the fuzzy DEMATEL methodology to ascertain the cause-and-effect relationship among the chosen indicators. The findings show that an organization's implementation of a sustainable strategy is contingent upon eight perspectives. The learning perspective, best represented by the Exchange of Organizational Knowledge indicator, carries the most significance. The Leadership perspective ranks second in importance, followed by Sustainability, Process, Socially Responsible Business, Growth/Market, Clients, and Finance. Applying this newly established model should enhance the probability of an organization's future sustainability.
