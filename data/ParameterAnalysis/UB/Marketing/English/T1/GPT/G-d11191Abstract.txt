The dissertation explores the feasibility of creating a flexible, adaptable process performance measurement model. Since modern organizational management involves process management, the organization’s goals are reliant on how well these processes perform. The success of these processes is gauged through key performance indicators. Part of the research examines the interplay between the organization’s high-level goals and process performance indicators in companies that have implemented a process-driven approach. This involves a thorough analysis and description of existing performance measurement models, with the aim of developing a flexible and adaptable model. This development includes defining the model's structure, links, and interdependencies, applying the model in practice, and improving it based on the results.

The dissertation substantiates the hypothesis that formalizing the interdependencies between an organization's highest level objectives and the key process performance indicators can enhance the flexibility and adaptability of business performance measurement systems. 

An extensive literature review permitted an in-depth scientific description and comparative analysis of existing process performance measurement models. Subsequently, a new model, named the GPI (Goal, Process, Indicator) model, has been proposed. This model allows for the direct recognition of the interdependencies between top-tier goals and process performance indicators and maintains a degree of flexibility and adaptability.

Upon completion of the case study research, improvements have been made to the original concept model. The research outcomes and the proposed GPI model pave the way not only for improved and simpler performance management but also for further study in this field.
