The doctoral thesis focuses on the creation of a national environmental management model that incorporates risk assessment methods. This model aids in the formation of national laws, strategies, and policies, and optimizes the handling of environmental risks at a countrywide level. Importantly, it allows for a comprehensive approach to environmental risk analysis, considering often-overlooked factors such as public perception of environmental risks and the varying environmental risk tendencies of different societal participants varying from individuals to organizations and other social groups. 

This national level environmental management model integrating risk assessment methods, presented in this dissertation, operates on a hybrid approach. It applies both qualitative and quantitative risk evaluation methods to classify environmental and ecological risks, thereby assisting in determining the priorities of environmental management goals. 

The model's implementation seeks to recognize crucial national environmental management areas and propose directions for establishing strategic priorities that address and mitigate environmental issues. A significant advantage of employing this model is its contribution to ameliorating the quality of the environment and the health of the nationâ€™s population. 

This is achieved by setting priorities in accomplishing environmental management goals based on ranked environmental and ecological risks, and actively involving the public not only in the risk perception and assessment stages, but also in key environmental decision-making processes. This inclusive approach fosters backing for the development of a clear and effective national policy and strategies to protect a country's environment.
