Turning state-run and publicly owned businesses into private entities is a critical step for the successful transition of Central and Eastern Europe, including Serbia, from communism to capitalism. Based on past experiences, these enterprises must undergo significant restructuring before being privatized. Various restructuring measures aim to enhance the overall performance and efficiency of these businesses, thereby increasing their value for shareholders. This dissertation focuses on the restructuring methodology that is grounded in key value drivers. Concepts such as the definition of value, value creation measurement, and value creation models are also discussed. The goal is to educate management on how to add value through proper decision-making regarding operations, financing, and investments. To generate value, management must implement strategies that increase the return on invested capital, decrease risk, or combine both aspects. The restructuring process's success is gauged by quantifying the value created, which is the disparity in the company's equity value before and after restructuring. A company's equity value is equivalent to the present value of its future cash flows, being influenced by future cash flow's value and the average cost of capital. Thus, to boost equity value, business endeavors must focus on augmenting cash flows by improving income and asset turnover, decreasing costs, and minimizing business risks and, by extension, the cost of capital. Employing the right equity sale method can also boost the equity price of companies undergoing restructuring. This paper analyses public tenders' and public auctions' effectiveness as modes of selling equity in restructuring and privatizing public and state-owned enterprises. The dissertation's research and analysis affirm the belief that company restructuring can enhance value and make a company more attractive for sale to potential investors. The restructuring methodology presented in this dissertation suggests that adopting a restructuring model based on key value drivers is possible and potentially profitable. Lastly, the findings from the analysis of Serbia's privatization outcomes suggest that the sale model of publicly and state-owned enterprises is the most effective privatization model during the late stage of transition.
