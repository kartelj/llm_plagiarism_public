Supply chain management involves all activities related to supply planning, including coordination with, and collaboration among, chain partners. The absence of proper coordination can lead to the bullwhip effect. Both operational and behavioral factors can cause this effect in supply chains. Most experts focus on operational causes, while behavioral ones are acknowledged but not heavily studied. Notably, personality traits, such as cooperativity, are among the behavioral causes. Despite the acknowledged need for collaboration in reducing the bullwhip effect within the supply chain, the impact of cooperativity as a personality trait has not been researched. This dissertation aims to analyze the impact of supply chain participant cooperativity on chain costs using a modified beer game, demonstrating how a supply chain with cooperative participants can be formed successfully. A social value orientation questionnaire was used to assess participant cooperativity. Confirming the central hypothesis of the study, an increase in participant cooperativity can boost supply chain function and aid in the resolution of intricate coordination issues. The investigation into the behavioral element and the communication analysis between supply chain participants used transactional analysis to enhance participant cooperativity within the supply chain. Finally, successful cooperative behaviors have been identified as supply chain conduct rules and incorporated into a simulation using Petri nets. This confirmed that Petri nets can potentially include a variety of factors affecting supply chains, including personality traits, effectively replacing a real-life experiment.
