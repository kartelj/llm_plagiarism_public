The doctoral thesis's main subject falls under the realm of the information society, its evolution, and the tactics employed to observe and quantify its progression. This thesis condenses existing research and hypotheses about the information society, its various forms, the factors that drive its expansion, and numerous international initiatives aimed at steering its worldwide progress. This thesis explores the most suitable measurements for observing, gauging and evaluating the actual state of the information society, which is defined as a complex concept determined by a collection of interconnected indicators. Besides offering a categorization and progression path for the benchmarking indicators essential to any methodology intended to quantify the information society, this thesis offers a summary of the most pertinent methodologies employed globally to evaluate the information society. The primary emphasis of this study is the creation of an original model specifying the actions needed to monitor and assess the information society's advancements in Serbia. The model assumes a theoretical foundation, compatibility with European Union (EU) standards, compliance with Serbian information society peculiarities and investment and further development possibilities of Serbia. The model's formulation includes the selection of Information Society Indicators (ISI), transformation of the ISI set for their ranking in terms of significance, extraction of the most relevant ISI, and the definition of a sub-model quantifying the digital divide through the Digital Polarization Index (DPI). This model is tested in Serbia over a five-year period, including statistical monitoring, data quantification and analysis, and analysis of the results to discover 'critical points' in the information society's development in Serbia and predict its future progress. The thesis's professional contribution includes the evaluation of the information society's development in Serbia from both the population and the economy's perspective and provides quantification and evaluation of the digital divide's intensity and trends. The key scientific contribution is the formulation of a model to monitor the development of the information society based on the I-distance method and cluster analysis. The initial indicators set was condensed to a subset of the most relevant ones, which retains valuable information while reducing the number of indicators, increasing the model's applicability in practice. The thesis also provides a model for quantifying the individual and overall digital divide in different sectors by introducing the digital polarization index. The model's primary attributes are its generality, flexibility, and openness for adding or changing its basic components to calculate various individual digital polarization sub-indices. The model's features are valuable given the rapid changes in the ICT sector. The thesis's social contribution is its potentially vast applications in monitoring and quantifying the information society, and guiding and aligning its development. The model could be used as a strategic decision-making tool, a tool for observing and reducing the digital divide, and a tool to support the evaluation of other complex social phenomena outside the information society framework.
