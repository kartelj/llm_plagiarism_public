Modern information and communication technologies have revolutionized teaching and learning opportunities through the introduction of innovative methods and tools that enhance the quality of e-education. Furthermore, smart learning environments and the Internet of Things have facilitated alterations in teaching and learning strategies in both traditional and virtual community settings. However, novel concepts such as collective intelligence and collaborative learning are yet to be fully formed theoretically and methodologically within the realm of e-education and smart learning environments. Crowdsourcing is one such concept that employs collective knowledge and skills to accomplish tasks, and it has been demonstrated to effectively innovate learning and teaching, scientific research and tackling various educational issues. This dissertation predominantly hypothesized that the incorporation of crowdsourcing models in smart learning environments enhances education performance and quality, boosts student motivation, and ameliorates end-results of the educational process. To verify these proposed crowdsourcing models, three research projects were conducted in two higher education establishments for the experimental segment of the doctoral dissertation. Evaluation results corroborated the immense potential of the proposed models, revealing the students' readiness to cooperate, their capability in problem-solving, and the production of quality solutions. Furthermore, it displayed the students' high self-organization levels.
