Today, the pharmaceutical sector is in a state of significant and dynamic change more so than ever before. This trend, filled with uncertainty and upheavals, is a global one, and both misjudgments and implemented strategies are common occurrences. Traditional medicine production has evolved into the modern pharmaceutical industry, a journey marked by critical changes throughout the twentieth century. Unprecedented advancements brought about by the new millennium are continuously propelling the pharmaceutical sector, preventing a lapse into stagnation and lethargy.

This research paper will explore the management of strategic changes in the pharmaceutical industry, with a particular focus on the industry in Serbia. Given the unique conditions and circumstances under which the pharmaceutical industry operates in Serbia, and considering the global industry's development dynamics, the lack of thorough application of strategic management and change management remains a concern in this sector. 

The study's aim is to conduct an in-depth analysis of the pharmaceutical sector and its operations. It will examine the sector's changes and set up an appropriate framework for managing strategic changes in Serbian pharmaceuticals with specific focus on strategic alterations. It will also define the concept of strategic changes and elucidate the primary models for managing such changes. 

A special emphasis will be placed on Kotterâ€™s change management model, a highly significant theoretical concept in this field. Moreover, the key elements and characteristics of healthcare and pharmaceutical industries will be analyzed both globally and within Serbia, including the importance of research, development, marketing, sales, and understanding of expenses and financial strategies.

This analysis will highlight global pharmaceutical industry trends and challenges, which undoubtedly impact the development direction and dynamics of Serbia's pharmaceutical industry. The distinctive characteristics of Serbia's healthcare and pharmaceutical market will be explored independently. Serbia's integration into Europe introduces significant changes in the industry, a crucial strategic field within the country. Prospects for future industry growth and development within Serbia will also be considered.

This thesis will also incorporate empirical research and call for a more systematic approach to improving change management in Serbia's pharmaceutical industry. The research findings will pave the way for a model of strategic change management in the Serbian pharmaceutical sector, enhancing company operations and boosting efficiency across the country's entire health sector.
