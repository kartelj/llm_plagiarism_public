The primary objective of this doctoral thesis is to establish composite models that enhance the procedures of multi-criteria decision-making. While existing tools for this purpose have been tested and found effective, the core issue stems from their lack of emphasis on comparison, conditionality and logical connections between decision-making attributes. As such, this paper proposes multi-criteria models that combine conventional and fuzzy techniques of multi-criteria analysis, supplemented by the usage of interpolate Boolean algebra. The hypothesis underpinning this thesis asserts that a blend of interpolate Boolean methods, fuzzy logic and multi-criteria analysis offers a superior modeling framework for the decision-making process than single method multi-criteria analysis. The inadequacy of conventional multi-criteria analysis in providing a suitable framework for managing uncertain or imprecise attributes gives rise to the use of fuzzy set theory which can analyze ambiguous attributes using fuzzy numbers. Therefore, in this doctoral paper, hybrid models encompassing conventional and fuzzy methods for multi-criteria analysis were created to rectify mentioned inadequacies and achieve consistently reliable results. Additionally, the examinee has proposed models based on interpolate Boolean algebra for potential logical interactions. By incorporating this approach, a realistic and comprehensive representation of the issue can be achieved. The proposed models have been examined via examples from ranking commercial banks and telecommunication equipment providers. To resolve the issue of selecting business banks, an integrated model that unites conventional and fuzzy methods of multi-criteria analysis is suggested. Simultaneously, resolving the supplier ranking problem calls for an integrated model that combines a two-tier multi-criteria analysis method and hybrid model featuring logical attribute interaction using Boolean algebra following all Boolean laws. The research revealed that by fusing multi-criteria analysis methods, the limitations of conventional methods can be circumvented and the outcomes of individual multi-criteria methods can be surpassed. By utilizing interpolate Boolean algebra, the modeling of connections and interdependence between attributes is made easier, allowing decision-makers to present clear problem outlines. The doctoral thesis's key contribution is the fortification of the decision-making system via the development of combined multi-criteria models, particularly when decision-making attributes cannot be accurately established due to potential conditionality and logical interactions. The chief motivation behind this paper is its practical applicability in real-world business systems.
