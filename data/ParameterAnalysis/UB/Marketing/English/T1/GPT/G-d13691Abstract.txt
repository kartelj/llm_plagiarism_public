Cyber warfare employs information communication technologies to conduct warfare within the digital realm. While it shares certain similarities with criminal, espionage, and terrorist activities, it differs from conventional warfare. This contemporary form of international conflict, which can occur during times of both peace and war, is expanding alongside the growth and globalization of information technologies. Cyber conflicts are becoming increasingly relevant as countries allocate more resources to develop their capabilities in this domain - some have even declared it the fifth field of military activity, alongside land, sea, air, and space. 

Despite the short period of time in which cyber warfare has emerged, there's a vast amount of literature on the subject. Many propose using existing laws of armed conflict as a regulatory guide, echoing the international community's natural instinct to regulate conflict. However, the anonymous nature of cyber attacks poses a significant challenge in identifying and attributing the perpetrators. Furthermore, the rapid technological advances, limitations of information communication technologies, and the dynamic nature of cyberspace pose barriers in predicting and understanding the full scope of cyber warfare and regulating it properly. 

Research into cyber warfare has uncovered that it is a technologically dependent form of conflict that deviates conceptually from traditional conflict. The obstacles in identifying attacks and holding attackers accountable originate from the technological nature of this form of warfare, and cannot be efficiently resolved by legal regulation alone. Instead, a more feasible method might involve technological solutions alongside legal ones.

This paper has explored the potential for applying traditional international laws of armed conflict to cyber conflicts and proposed potential measures for the future conduct of states in creating cyber defense capabilities. Cyber warfare is primarily a process, an intentional breach of a system's information security for military purposes, which is heavily dependent on computer systems technology and information security.

This research concludes that the growth of cyber warfare is largely dependent on the development of information communication technologies over the international community's ability to legally regulate cyber conflicts in a traditional manner. Thus, the regulation of cyber warfare at the international level must be a comprehensive effort involving diplomatic, political, economic, military, legal, informational, and other activities. The only feasible solution to dilute the potential negative effects of cyber warfare is through bilateral and multilateral cooperation among the interested parties within the international community.
