Stochastic programming, a subdivision of operational research, examines methods to include uncertainty in decision-making processes since the decision maker doesn't always possess the full required information. The main challenge with using stochastic programming stems from the uncertainty of model parameters and the fact that the optimal solution relates to the deterministic twin of the original problem. Evaluating the quality of a specific deterministic equivalent considering the value of criterion function, which could be random and the likelihood of satisfying stochastic constraints is another issue.

Numerous fields apply stochastic programming, including but not limited to production planning, supply chains, logistics, transportation, finance and marketing. There are three popular solution approaches to stochastic programming problems: stochastic optimization, robust optimization, and chance constrained programming, which all form the basis for research in optimization.

Robust optimization is a careful approach that focuses on the worst-case scenario by defining a deterministic equivalent that eliminates all uncertainty. On the contrary, chance constrained programming handles uncertainty in constraint parameters and uses distinctive techniques for problem-solving. The basic assumption is that an uncertain, stochastic constraint must comply with a preset probability. The requirement for this approach is the need to clarify the constraints such that the risk that the obtained solution may not be fulfilled, is a preset probability of constraint satisfaction, which the decision maker can accept.

The most challenging aspect of chance constraint is tractability, linked mainly to the possibility of identifying accurate probability distributions of the stochastic parameters. Even though, all the mentioned stochastic programming approaches are supplementary in resolving optimization problems with uncertainty, each having its strengths and weaknesses.

The subject of this dissertation is studying different techniques in handling uncertainty in mathematical models, or rather, creating a new means to address stochastic programming models. The underlying supposition is that combining conventional deterministic optimization and simulation can effectively solve real-life stochastic programming issues. The research goal is to contribute to the stochastic programming field by developing a new method to solve weak structured problems. To elaborate, this dissertation proposes an iterative optimization-simulation approach, consisting of two stages: the optimization stage, where the deterministic twin of the original issue is solved optimally, and a simulation stage, where constraint satisfaction probability is assessed via simulation.

Each deterministic equivalent embodies a new scenario, verified with simulation power. If the outcome dissatisfies the decision maker, a fresh scenario of the original stochastic problem with new deterministic values will be defined. The experience derived from scenario checking helps in developing heuristics, used as simple rules for scenario generation. The principal research objective is to employ the achieved optimal solutions through this approach as beneficial managerial decisions that allow achievement of goals and application of stochastic models in real-life concerns.

The primary contribution of this dissertation is formulating a novel and efficient method to solve stochastic optimization problems using a simulation approach. Also, a new scenario will be proposed for solving stochastic optimization models, simplifying the application of suitable algorithms for resolving these models and applying them in the real world.
