The mining industry consistently requires advanced solutions and improved, dependable, and safe methods throughout the entire production process, from inception to closure. This necessitates an interplay between the mining industry and research, science, education, technology, workplace organization, and standardization. The productivity of mining isn't solely determined by natural elements, the expertise of workers, modern machinery, and socio-political climate, but also significantly hinged on proficient supervision and effective management - mining management. It's this understanding that has guided the topic and development of this doctoral thesis, which explores the effects of international standards on Serbia's mining industry. The research has several objectives: to survey accomplishments in this field both globally and nationally; to examine the philosophy of management systems and international standards; and to evaluate the suitability of these management systems and standards in the multifaceted environment of the mining industry. Our research affirms the preliminary hypothesis that international standards alone aren't sufficient enough to effectively manage mining systems. As such, a structural model, which incorporates international standards to adequately address mining management needs towards exploitation, safety, productivity, and environmental protection is proposed. This thesis addresses significant and pressing issues within the sector. The research carried out is demonstrably valuable to the mining industry, with distinct scientific and practical implications, which is evident in the results yielded in both respects.
