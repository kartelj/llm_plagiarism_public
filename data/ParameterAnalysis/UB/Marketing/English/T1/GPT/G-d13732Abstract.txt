This thesis explores the challenges faced by electronic media in the B2B sector. It delves deeply into electronic media services, along with the transformations brought by modern e-business technologies in using those services. Customer Relationship Management (CRM) is identified as a crucial part of electronic media's B2B operations. Focused attention is given to the advanced methods and technologies employed for managing relationships with stakeholders in the electronic media domain. Furthermore, the thesis explores ways to enhance relationship management between public broadcasters and stakeholders, utilizing avant-garde e-business technologies like social media, digital and interactive TV, and mobile computing. A model outlining customer relationship management for the B2B electronic media business has been drafted in this thesis, facilitating the execution of sophisticated CRM services and fostering collaboration with stakeholders. Moreover, the study investigates opportunities to unite diverse types of media and services into a unified electronic media business structure, accounting for information, processes, application components, and human resources. The thesis then moves into an experimental segment, wherein an assessment of the proposed customer relationship model for the B2B business is carried out within the Radio Television of Serbia's e-business model. Findings from the experimental segment strengthen the broad hypothesis that incorporating and merging CRM into the electronic media business model enhances overall business performance, coordinates electronic media business procedures, and results in increased client satisfaction and loyalty.
