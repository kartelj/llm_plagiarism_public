Open badges are a promising educational technology for recognizing the achievements, skills, qualities and interests of an individual or а group. In recent years, there has been a growing number of software systems based on the Open Badges Infrastructure (OBI) which support different teaching/learning and badging practices. However, their usability in a specific educational environment can vary significantly. This brings some great challenges for teachers when choosing one such system for a concrete educational application. The aim of this research is to propose some prospective usability metrics - general and technology-specific for OBI-compliant systems, which can be used effectively when selecting this educational technology. The main research result is a methodological framework that has included some standard general usability metrics (e.g., score of perceived usability based on System Usability Scale) and the technology- specific usability metrics that have been developed within the research (e.g., score of ‘ease of sharing badges’, score of ‘support for badge creation satisfaction’, etc.). The proposed approach has been examined in an empirical study based on a mixed research method. The results of the study provided evidence of the effectiveness of the proposed approach in the given context. It has been shown that the proposed categories of metrics are complementary and that the metrics have differentiated the evaluated systems in a satisfactory manner. In addition, the results of qualitative evaluation revealed the main usability problems of the evaluated systems. The approach can be applied in different educational settings, given that the proposed metrics are relatively simple to collect and interpret.
