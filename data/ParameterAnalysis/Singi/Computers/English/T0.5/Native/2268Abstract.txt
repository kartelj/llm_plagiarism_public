The need to increase the data-rate of transfered multimedia and also the more stringent requirements for copyright protection in modern society is becoming more pronounced. In this context, FSO communications are a very good alternative to conventional wireless communication systems. These systems, in areas where their use is possible provide extremely high performance to users, with data rate transfer of up to several Gb and practically extremely high security option. Because of its cheap realization of their application, in the "last mile" connection, is practical and important. This paper explores the possibility of transmitting the images FSO communication channel in the presence of scintillation. Researched the transfer of copyright protected data (watermarked images) and the impact of FSO channels on their degradation, degradation or protection code, as well as color images to detect fires in the image after transmission over FSO communication channel.
