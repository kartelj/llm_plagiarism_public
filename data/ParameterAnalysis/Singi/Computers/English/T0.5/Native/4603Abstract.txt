In this thesis, performance analysis of wireless transmission over α-k-µ-g and k-µ-g fading channels has been investigated. Closed-form expressions have been derived for the probability density function (PDF) and cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for such observed channel. Standard performance measures of received signal, such are outage probability (OP) and level crossing rate (LCR) will been obtained for this transmission case, in the function of various values of system parameters. Further, improvement of these performance measures has been analyzed for the case when space diversity was used at the reception. Several space diversity techniques, namely selection combining (SC) and maximal-ratio combining (MRC) have been considered in the thesis in order to point out how fading influence could be reduced. Finally, simultaneous multipath fading and shadowing occurrence has been analyzed, and macro-diversity reception combining has been considered along with micro-diversity combining in order to mitigate these harmful effects and improve reception signal quality. Obtained results from thesis have shown that proposed approach guarantees reduction of harmful effects of observed α-k-µ-g and k-µ-g fading occurence in various wireless transmission scenarios.
