This dissertation proposes a class of systems for generating and distributing cryptological keys based on multiple biometric modalities. The theoretical framework encompasses two biometric modalities, the fingerprint, and the iris. In the working modes, the system uses the hash values obtained in the initial phase, i.e., the enrollment phase. In addition to these values, auxiliary data are used to make biometric data revocable and, in this way, protect the privacy of biometric data. In addition, they provide protection for cryptological parameters. Iris biometrics, as the source that contains the largest number of bio-information, was used to extract the secret key, while the fingerprint is used for authentication purposes. The experimental analysis, which encompassed the entire research aspect of the thesis, is based on the samples obtained from the CASIA biometric database, and the achieved experimental results indicate significant contributions that greatly improve the performance of this class of systems.
