The future of information security is projected to undergo a significant transformation, with a fundamental shift towards a new theoretical framework of computer security. This change is expected to enable the development of a comprehensive range of protection mechanisms that are not reliant on an attacker's computational power. Interestingly, the realization of this hypothesis hinges on the evolution of novel digital signal processing methods, which should supply sufficient information to the physical layer of contemporary communication networks. The implementation of purely random extraction could be instrumental in formulating new protocols and encryption key exchanges with maximum length and imprecision. In the realm of trustworthy and acceptable authentication practices, biometrics is emerging as a crucial cryptology parameter source. The digital signal processing of biometric data is vital for creating and extracting maximum entropy authentication codes. In terms of digital content copyright management, digital media and both visible and invisible digital seals are also becoming increasingly important. All these factors contribute to a fresh perspective on this discipline in the theory and practice of comprehensive information protection systems. The proposed thesis aims to identify, analyze, and develop a category of digital signal processing subsystems to address the new challenges posed by these advancements in information protection within modern computer and communication systems. The primary focus is on the development of encryption key systems based on iris biometrics.
