This doctoral thesis introduces an innovative fingerprint biometric cryptosystem, utilizing the fuzzy commitment scheme and deep convolutional neural networks. The paper's unique contribution lies in its new method for automatically discretizing fingerprint texture descriptors, entirely reliant on a convolutional neural network and designed to produce fixed-length templates. The proposed two-bit coding quantization of the extracted features transforms biometric templates into a binary domain, enabling the use of XOR biometrics and the creation of a biometric cryptosystem. This system can be utilized for key-release or as a safeguarding mechanism in fingerprint matching systems. The issue of biometric data variability is mitigated through the application of secure block-level Bose–Chaudhuri–Hocquenghem error correction codes, which are resistant to statistical-based attacks. The proposed biometric cryptosystem can handle a key length of 265 bits, satisfying the demands of contemporary cryptographic systems, with an acceptable EER of 1%. The evaluation indicates notable performance improvements in comparison to other texture-based fingerprint matching and biometric cryptosystems.
