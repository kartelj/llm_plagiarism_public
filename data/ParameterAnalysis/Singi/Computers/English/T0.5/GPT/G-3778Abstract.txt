The primary objective of this study is to establish a comprehensive semiotics/axiology model of discernment-interpretation-reasoning and apply it specifically to visual objects, phenomena and media - often considered as value bearers. The study will also tackle practices that either generate or encode values. However, it will not address every single visual subject or linguistic expression used across various human interest fields, but rather suggest a broad approach and method for reasoning about the conditions and reasons for creating different values. It will propose a system for organizing and classifying the interpretation, reasoning, perception and evaluation of sensory phenomena, particularly visual ones. 

Alongside a brief history of semiotic considerations, the resulting theory will offer a fresh interpretation and technical expressions of semiotics/axiology, the critical theory of signs/symbols, define them and then propose their application in the interpretation and evaluation of four aspects (aesthetic, functional, moral-ethical, cognitive) of sensory phenomena. Special emphasis will be on the visual field of human sensitivity, the visual appearance of phenomena, artificial phenomena construction processes, and sign/symbolic coding and decoding in visual arts, design, and communication design practices, using historical examples.

The study's specific objective is to illustrate the dynamics of semiotic differentiation-interpretation-evaluation of phenomena that necessarily presupposes and is inseparable and limited by anthropocentrically generated dualities, primary polarities, such as: subject/object, real/unreal, true/false, suitable/unsuitable, pleasant/unpleasant, functional/dysfunctional, etc. This will be achieved by analyzing the structurally set value polarities embodied in technofacts during five historical phases: Western Renaissance, pre-industrial, industrial, information and post-information periods. 

The study will also show how historically, culturally generated and semantically defined polarities chronologically tend to “equalize”, through revolutions, turns and hierarchical reversals, while simultaneously maintaining the syntactic continuity and structural integrity of duality. This preservation of the structurally primary polarity of the mathematical type +/- will be demonstrated through the analysis of historical events, examples and milestones that contributed to the semantic changes in polarity within the context of creativity, innovation, historical increase in production, reproductive efficiency, and value distribution.
