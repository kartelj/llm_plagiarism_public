The doctoral dissertation focuses on contemporary challenges linked to cryptographic key exchange and user authentication in a confidential communication system. The thesis scrutinizes existing solutions in the research and development realm of confidential communication systems and proposes a unique system. The academic aim of the thesis is to enhance the protocol for swapping cryptographic keys based on electronic identification (eID). An analysis of current research approaches was conducted to bolster protection during confidential communication and lay the foundation for the development of a unique system. By merging cryptographic methods that guarantee confidentiality, authenticity, and integrity, and employing steganographic methods for clandestine information exchange, users of the suggested system can swap confidential messages securely and effectively. Upon analyzing the research results, it was determined that using identification electronic communication for exchanging cryptographic keys secretly is justifiable.
