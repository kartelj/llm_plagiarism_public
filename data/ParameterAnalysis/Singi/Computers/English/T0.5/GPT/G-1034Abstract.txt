Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs) are self-regulating networks of interconnected nodes that use wireless technology, functioning without any centralized administrative control. They are currently a significant topic in research due to their wide range of applications, including military and emergency services. In MANETs, each node serves as both host and router, which means it must be capable of transmitting packets to other nodes. The constant mobility of nodes causes frequent changes in network topologies. To address these issues, specific routing protocols for MANETs are required, as traditional protocols used in wired networks are not efficient in this context. This thesis aims to examine the current state of the art in existing MANETs routing protocols and compare various approaches. There are three primary categories of routing protocols for MANETs: reactive, proactive, and hybrid. A new routing protocol, OLSR-BF, is proposed after analyzing the pros and cons of each category. This proactive routing protocol is primarily based on the existing OLSR routing protocol, with modifications primarily incorporating the Bellman-Ford algorithm to determine the shortest distance between nodes within a MANET network. The design and performance of the new routing protocol are validated through qualitative comparison with existing AODV, DSDV, and OLSR routing protocols.
