In order to maintain information security within the digital realm, it's crucial to establish cryptographic algorithms that offer robust data and communication protection. These algorithms should support high-speed communication, demand minimal processing resources, and offer a compact implementation. These features suggest a category of sequential cryptographic algorithms, specifically the creation of pseudorandom generators with the mentioned characteristics. Given these prerequisites, this work aims to develop a reliable and efficient class of pseudorandom generators. A category of random processes based on variable permutations is identified, and its probabilistic and statistical properties are examined. This defined class of random processes is used as a reference model to establish a class of pseudorandom generators parameterized with two pseudorandom sequences. By employing probability theory, information theory, and number theory, the properties of this defined class of pseudorandom generators are analyzed. We derive the sufficient conditions for the output sequence of the defined pseudorandom generators to have a nearly uniform distribution of output symbols. Correlation analysis reveals that the elements of the parameterizing sequences and the output sequence are essentially independent, leading to the conclusion that the information carried by the output sequence element about the generator's current internal state is nearly zero. An examination of the output sequence period reveals that with suitable selection of parameterizing sequences, the output sequence period significantly exceeds that of the parameterizing sequences. These features are vital for cryptographic pseudorandom generators. The proposed construction's efficiency is achieved through its compactness and the selection of efficient pseudorandomly generated parameterizing sequences, such as sequences generated by multiple linear shift registers. The potential applications of this proposed class of reliable pseudorandom generators are also discussed.
