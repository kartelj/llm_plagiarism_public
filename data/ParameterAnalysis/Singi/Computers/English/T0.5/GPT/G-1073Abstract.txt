The dissertation focuses on examining e-business systems interoperability models through the lens of service-oriented software development, considering various aspects. The research takes into account standards, interoperability frameworks, enterprise information systems architecture, ontologies-based semantic technologies, and service orientation. The dissertation offers insights into the current scenario, best practices, and emerging trends, and proposes solutions to interoperability issues. These include a methodological framework for ad-hoc connection of e-business systems, a generic meta-model ensuring semantic consistency of the system and the description and discovery of e-business systems components, and a service-oriented architecture model for semantic interoperability of business processes on an ad-hoc basis. The research findings were validated by enhancing interoperability and business process execution in the field of cultural heritage protection. The results have enhanced the utilization of information, documents, and illustrative materials related to various types of cultural artifacts.
