This thesis aimed to evaluate the conditions of patients with neuro-motor diseases using healthcare sensor networks and to investigate whether tennis as a therapeutic sport is more effective than traditional rehabilitation methods. Another objective was to highlight the growing security risks these sensor networks face, an important factor to monitor closely. The thesis compared the recovery progress of two patients with similar age, strength, and physique, one undergoing regular rehabilitation and the other using tennis as a rehabilitation tool. Additionally, the progress of the entire group was compared with a control group. The study also analyzed the healthcare sensor networks, their security measures, and installation procedures. The research concluded that patients who used tennis for rehabilitation showed faster and superior improvement, with a stronger stroke power by the end of the study compared to those undergoing traditional rehabilitation. Thus, the study's results were successful. The research also supported my other hypothesis that technological advancements are leading to increased security vulnerabilities in various networks.
