The cloud computing model, similar to network computing, relies on resource clustering and the use of network and internet technologies. Essentially, cloud computing provides computing resources like data, software, and hardware components (such as processing units, memory, and storage) as a service. As a current and significant multidisciplinary field, cloud computing has been the subject of numerous papers in leading international journals and conferences. Studies in this field have identified various challenges and problems in the cloud environment that can be more effectively addressed with improved methods, techniques, and algorithms. A key challenge is scheduling user requests on a limited pool of resources (virtual machines). This scheduling problem involves creating a task execution schedule on these limited resources, considering potential constraints and an objective function. Scheduling is done using static or dynamic algorithms. Static scheduling, which doesn't allow for dynamic task switching between overused and underused virtual machines, allocates tasks to available virtual machines before the scheduling algorithm is run. Dynamic scheduling, also known as load balancing, allocates workloads between active virtual machines during the scheduling algorithm's runtime. Tasks are dynamically switched from overused to less used virtual machines. Heuristic and metaheuristic optimization methods are commonly used for dynamic scheduling, with impressive results. Task scheduling and load balancing issues in cloud computing are categorized as NP-hard combinatorial and/or global problems, with or without constraints. Swarm intelligence metaheuristics have been successfully tested on benchmark and practical NP-hard optimization problems, achieving better results in terms of convergence speed and solution quality than other methods, techniques, and algorithms. This doctoral thesis explores whether swarm intelligence metaheuristics can further improve task scheduling and load balancing in a cloud computing environment. The thesis presents the implementation of two improved swarm intelligence algorithms - the monarch butterfly optimization algorithm and whale optimization algorithm. Two task scheduling models are considered: single-objective optimization, which aims to minimize total task execution time on the cloud, and multi-objective optimization, which aims to minimize both total task execution time and the total cost of utilized cloud resources. The algorithms were tested using artificial data generated within the CloudSim platform and real data retrieved from a global benchmark database. The improved algorithms were also validated against standard benchmark sets for unconstrained global optimization. A comparison of the improved metaheuristics' results with the best-known metaheuristics and heuristics confirmed that task scheduling and load balancing in cloud computing can be further enhanced using swarm intelligence algorithms.
