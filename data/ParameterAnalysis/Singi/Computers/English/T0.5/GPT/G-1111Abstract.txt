The issue of stock-outs is a significant problem in the retail industry, leading directly to lost sales, decreased profits and potential customer loss. The rate of stock-outs is largely dependent on retail chain business practices and can vary greatly due to numerous factors, with the global average being between 5 - 10%. This high rate can result in an average financial loss of 4% of the total turnover for the retail chain. This study aimed to explore the various factors that could affect the increase of stock-outs in retail and how an automated ordering system could address these issues. The literature review focused on the organizational, operational, and technological aspects of the stock-out problem. A thorough exploration of the stock-out issue and various automated ordering system concepts in retail created the necessary conditions for measuring the effectiveness of automated ordering systems. The study's primary goal was to establish a link between different stock-keeping units' (SKU) attributes and retail business stock-out performance and to evaluate the automated ordering system's ability to deal with challenges related to risky SKUs. The data sample was taken from a large Serbian retailer and included two high-risk product categories, totaling 115 items and 97 stores, observed over one calendar year. A perpetual inventory aggregation method was used to identify stock-outs, and probit regression and t-test statistics were used to measure the impact of SKU attributes and the ordering system's performance. An analysis of the stock-out rate, conducted before the main statistical analysis, identified patterns of stock-out variation, such as weekly fluctuations and differences in performance between SKUs and product categories. This could highlight potential causes of stock-outs and provide valuable data for further analysis. The impact measurement of potentially high-risk SKU attributes on stock-out performance revealed that product availability in the distribution center, promotional activity, and sales speed negatively impact stock-out performance. However, a decrease in the number of stock-outs was observed when the ordering process was automated. Despite this, the retailer-risk category was more sensitive to promotion and sales speed. The statistical analysis revealed that the automated ordering system performed significantly better than the manual one for cheaper items, promotional items, faster items, and items with significant sales variation, although this was not proven for items with larger packaging. In contrast, no significant performance improvement was recorded at the distribution center level for items ordered automatically compared to those ordered manually.
