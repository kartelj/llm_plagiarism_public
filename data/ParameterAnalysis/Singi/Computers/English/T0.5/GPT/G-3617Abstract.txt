We are currently observing how mobile devices have become an integral part of our daily lives, largely due to social media and the rapid dissemination of news. However, a mere decade ago, mobile apps were created for specific uses and their operational capabilities were significantly inferior to what we have today. This evolution of mobile devices has spurred growth in seemingly unrelated scientific fields, which have harnessed their synergy through the advancement of mobile devices and their applications. This primarily pertains to telecommunications, electronics, software engineering, and internet technology.

The rapid progress in these sectors has allowed mobile devices to match the functionality of traditional PCs and continues to drive future advancements. However, the deviceâ€™s independence and power autonomy remain limiting factors. Despite advancements in battery technology, significant autonomy has yet to be achieved. Market demands call for faster processors, slimmer devices, larger screens, and crucially, mobile internet functionality.

Mobile device manufacturers aim to maintain these features while enhancing the device's energy efficiency and autonomy. This can be achieved through hardware and software innovations. It is well-known that internet usage is a major power drain, indicating a need for optimization. This is addressed in the current mobile services model.

Most mobile apps operate on a master-slave communication principle with various servers, exchanging large amounts of data. Whether it's reading messages, checking weather forecasts, or using social networks or online games, the app sends and receives complex data structures. In the current era of object-oriented programming languages, all this data can be treated as lists and series of class instances or objects. The process of converting complex data structures into a byte series suitable for transmission is known as data serialization.

This paper presents research findings on energy-efficient transmission of serialized data between servers and mobile devices. The authors created a test environment to measure power consumption during server communication. The results were used to develop a mathematical model incorporating functions that represent the time required for serialization and the size of a serialized file. This data was used to develop an experimental API-CBSaver, which uses mathematical models to select the most efficient serialization and compression method in real time. The results from the API-CBSaver test suggest a path forward for improving energy efficiency.
