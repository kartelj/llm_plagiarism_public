Having consistent access to improvements in product, service, and software quality allows organizations to adapt flexibly to rapid changes typical of modern market economies. The ability to remain competitive in the market is achieved through continuous enhancement of product, service, and software quality. Quality improvement can only be realized by managing all the process input elements that affect quality. In this study, we will define a product as the outcome of a certain process, and consider three aspects: 1) product; 2) service and 3) software. This study will present a methodology for establishing and assessing user requirements, and identifying the process input elements that affect the satisfaction of these requirements. Many factors can influence the quality of a product and the satisfaction of user requirements, making quality management complex. There are numerous alternative solutions for enhancing product quality, each with its own implementation costs and varying effects on product quality. While it's easy to determine the implementation costs for each solution, the challenge lies in determining how improving a certain factor will affect product quality and, indirectly, user satisfaction. The question is how to select the optimal combination of factors that affect product quality, given limited financial resources. What will be the effect of improving certain factors on product quality? To analyze the impact of improving factors that affect product quality on the final product's compliance with user requirements, we will use a simulation of the final product's compliance using Markov's process with the help of the Matlab programming language. This study is a significant contribution to the improvement of modeling methodology and the management of factors that affect product quality. A key contribution of this study is its social impact and ability to solve practical problems in business systems related to improving the quality of processes that affect the satisfaction of requirements. The findings of this research can serve as a foundation for decision-making regarding the direction to take to enhance product quality. Key words: quality, product quality, process input elements, factors affecting product quality, quality improvement, Markov's processes, simulation of quality improvement effects.
