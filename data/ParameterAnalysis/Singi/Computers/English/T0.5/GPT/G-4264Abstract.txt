This thesis research was aimed at identifying the algorithms and software structures of adaptive systems applicable in traffic regulation at light-controlled intersections. It established a model for calculating the signal plan for four-way intersections, regulated by traffic lights, with two or more stages that can accommodate both non-congested and congested traffic flows. An in-depth analysis and functionality test of the proposed adaptive systems for traffic regulation were conducted, particularly in scenarios involving the passage of emergency vehicles through the intersection and when such vehicles are in the dilemma zone.
