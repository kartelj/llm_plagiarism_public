The creation of high-quality random number sequences is a critical component of any cryptographic system, necessitating a meticulous approach to the design and verification of generators. The quality of sequences produced by random value generators, specifically those based on sound cards, is significantly influenced by the randomness source's entropy level and the post-processing procedure employed. This procedure allows for the distillation of a random analog signal's digitized form, resulting in a uniformly distributed set of genuinely random numbers.

This dissertation investigates existing random sequence generators that utilize sound cards and introduces a new class of these generators. Random number sequences are integral to numerous fields, including cryptography, simulations, gambling, sampling, decision-making, medicine, aesthetics, and art. The most commonly used random value generator is the pseudorandom number generator (PRNG), a mathematical algorithm that produces a deterministic, periodic array of numerical values determined by the initial state, known as SID.

In contrast, true random number generators (TRNG) are based on non-deterministic natural phenomena such as sound noise, radioactive decay, semiconductor-generated thermal noise, resistor thermal noise, photoelectric effects, and various quantum phenomena. They produce non-periodic true random numbers. Numerous studies have sought to optimize random number generation using sound cards, most of which have been based on PRNG needs or structures.

This dissertation proposes a method for obtaining true random bits from computer hardware's sound card, which is induced with environmental random signal noise, and post-processing (distilling) with a novel process of mixing the input string and XOR-ing neighboring bits (Mibis & XOR). This post-processing method effectively separates and removes correlated adjacent bits from the input string, then XORs the neighboring bits in the newly obtained set, reducing autocorrelation, increasing entropy, and reducing bias of the output bits set.

Statistical randomness tests indicate that this class of generators has excellent characteristics and can quickly generate a large volume of high-quality true random numbers. The dissertation's first part (Chapters 2 and 3) provides the theoretical basis necessary to understand the original contributions presented in the second part. Chapter 2 introduces concepts of random process, random signal, and stochastic signal sources, which are essential for generating a true random number series. Chapter 3 discusses the basics of sound cards and environmental noise signals.

The second part of the dissertation (Chapters 4 and 5) presents the original research findings. Chapter 4 presents the results achieved in developing new methods for obtaining random sequences and the basic characteristics of true random number generators. It also explains the working principle, classification, characteristics, latest research, designs, and stages of true random number generators in detail and discusses various post-processing techniques and their effectiveness, advantages, and disadvantages. Chapter 5 presents the results of applying the new distillation techniques.

The dissertation emphasizes the importance and development of new processes for generating true random sequences to produce fast, efficient, and affordable random number generators accessible to a wide audience. It pays particular attention to developing new effective methods for generating random sequences based on the hardware potential of personal desktop systems, laptops, tablets, and smartphones. The efficient system presented allows for quick generation of random values with sufficient unpredictability, making it suitable for many applications in various fields, despite its original intent for cryptographic purposes. The results contribute to the development of hardware and software environments for further improvements in random sequence generators.
