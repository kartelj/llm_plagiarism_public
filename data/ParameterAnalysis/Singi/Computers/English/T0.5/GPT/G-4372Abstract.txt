Modern businesses grapple daily with an overload of information and data, making it challenging to operate and make effective decisions. It's crucial for these companies to apply management knowledge to enhance their business operations. The focus is increasingly shifting towards safeguarding the manner of accessing and managing organizational memory - the company's knowledge. The concept of management intelligence is becoming an essential element of successful business strategies, as it helps manage this organizational memory.

Integrated automated organizational memory management, despite its complexity, offers a solution for the interplay between knowledge management and information technology. This approach simplifies the decision-making process and the flow of documentation, information, and data within a company. It also provides the company with detailed data, facilitating concrete business decision-making. However, protecting such an integrated automated process is a critical requirement.

In line with international standards like ISO 27001, the management in such systems should establish a model for implementing, handling, monitoring, reviewing, maintaining, and improving the security of the organization's memory management system. A cryptographic solution should balance user requirements, functionality within the organization's memory, and the need to protect sensitive data and maintain their integrity.

The integrated automated process of organizational memory management could be beneficial for learning intelligent systems and modern business decision-making. Digital signing guarantees the non-repudiation and immutability of documents, complying with current legal regulations for electronic documents. This paper will propose a method of protecting the integrated system for organizational memory management by recording data in encrypted form, accessible only through the company's information system.

The paper will also present a unique cryptographic solution for memory protection from a knowledge management perspective. Only explicitly authorized system users would have access to documents and data through the access permission management system. It will discuss principles and models that ensure data protection and privileged access, aiming to facilitate decision-making based on organizational memory. Security information agencies provide the best examples for such an analysis, with numerous instances of both successful organizations and lapses in their operations.
