Today's two primary technologies are believed to be the Internet of Things (IoT) and blockchain. The enhancement of system connectivity and reduction of delays have resulted in more flexible use of applications on remote devices. However, the IoT faces significant issues, including inadequate computing resources, limited memory, and weak processors optimized for low energy consumption, which hinder the use of strong encryption algorithms. Other challenges include poor interoperability, security vulnerabilities, privacy concerns, and a lack of standards. 

This paper suggests the implementation of a software interface as a security gateway architecture for smart devices. This security interface enables the use of more robust cryptographic algorithms for servicing smart devices remotely, thereby improving the security of data transmitted by smart devices. It does this by using compatible data encryption algorithms before the data is sent to remote services. 

In this paper, blockchain technology is also employed. The rationale behind this is to introduce decentralization and authentication into the network of interconnected smart devices. The incorporation of blockchain provides the much-needed anonymity and flexibility that the current IoT lacks. Blockchain safeguards the interface with its single point control technologies, records all transactions, validates them, and thus fosters trust among devices within a single network. 

The outcome of this study is the creation of an interface that enables smart devices to utilize any cryptographic algorithm, offers the capacity to map IP addresses, and therefore prevents unauthorized network access. Additionally, blockchain technology will be integrated in a compatible manner to ensure its efficient operation on smart devices, taking into account resource constraints.
