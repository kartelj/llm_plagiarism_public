This doctoral thesis explores a technically effective and socially applicable solution to guarantee the identity of each newborn baby. The importance of this issue has significantly increased due to past suspicions of baby swapping or theft in Serbian birthplaces. Numerous lawsuits, particularly those from the International Court of Law in Strasbourg, France, have also highlighted this issue. The proposed solution involves an authentic distributive information system and a unique patented device for biometric parental identification based on fingerprint minutiae. This system and device synergistically enhance the efficiency of the proposed solution, guaranteeing 100% real-time accuracy in confirming the identity of each newborn and providing proof of parenthood. Special attention has been given to the system's security aspects, given the sensitivity of the data involved. Standalone algorithms have been developed for data acquisition and identity verification of both mother and baby at birth and upon departure from the birthplace. Procedures and timing for these actions have also been established. Cancelable biometrics are used to ensure total safety from data compromise or security corruption. The implementation of this system will significantly improve the quality of the healthcare system in the Republic of Serbia, benefiting institutions such as birthplaces and hospitals, as well as the quality of service for its citizens. It will eliminate the possibility of human error and simplify numerous procedures in the current system used in hospitals throughout Serbia. This doctoral thesis will present a system that prevents any possible change in babies' identities, replacements or theft, improving the speed and quality of service to ensure that babies are indeed 100% theirs under real-time conditions.
