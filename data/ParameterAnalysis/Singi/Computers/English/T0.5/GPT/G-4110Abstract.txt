Research in human-computer interaction incorporates a multifaceted approach, drawing from various scientific fields such as computer science, psychology, sociology, cognitive sciences, and design. Modern interfaces, equipped with a myriad of sensors like a mouse, keyboard, eyetracker, EEG, pulse monitor, and heart rate monitor, enable this interaction. The focus of this research is the application of artificial intelligence in analyzing and evaluating human-computer interaction, and specifically, the cognitive performance of respondents. The system's high-speed data analysis, surpassing human processing capabilities, allows for real-time user feedback, thus making the system an active participant in the interaction. 

The feasibility of developing an AI model for gathering and analyzing human-computer interaction data was demonstrated using four cognitive performance assessments: Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WSCT), Visual Short Term Working Memory Test (VSTWMT), mTutor Test, and the AC Test. Individual client applications were developed for each experiment, with the ability to connect to sensor applications via the HCI-MAP Synchronization Platform. Data was collected using three sensors: an EEG device, an eye tracking device, and a computer mouse. Independent sensor applications were created to facilitate data aggregation and joint processing of the entire interaction. 

Our research findings indicated some deviation from the reference values in the number of achieved categories and attempts to achieve the first category in the WCS test. However, there were no significant discrepancies in errors in maintaining the set. 

Visual short-term memory (VSTM), the ability to remember brief visual information, was tested through two sessions. The EEG data was classified using four algorithms: Naive Bayes, Support Vector, KNN, and Random Forest. The results indicated a high accuracy in classifying the order and type of images presented.

The mTuror platform experiment aimed to develop an AI model for electronic knowledge assessment. While no strong correlation was found between any individual parameter and response accuracy, the experiment demonstrated that the emotional state of subjects could be influenced by question types. 

The AC test, used to assess attention levels, revealed a high correlation between gaze position and mouse cursor position. This correlation suggests that data from one sensor can help approximate the interaction of the other. 

In summary, our research confirms the potential of using AI to analyze human-computer interaction. AI's application can yield results as good as, if not better than, human analysis. Distributed solutions can be implemented for real-time system feedback, and AI can effectively assess cognitive performance.
