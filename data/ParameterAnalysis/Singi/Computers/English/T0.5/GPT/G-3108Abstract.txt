In the early 21st century, Information Technology (IT) became an integral part of the educational system. However, issues arose in acquiring the necessary equipment and integrating IT into modern education. Many developing countries underutilize the potential of this technology, primarily due to inadequate technical equipment in schools and insufficient teacher training. Most schools rely on proprietary software from IT companies, often priced exorbitantly. This study intends to introduce a new research perspective in the field of information systems and education, focusing on the potential and influence of Open Source Software (OSS). This subject is gaining traction, especially after Munich's decision to transition to OSS to save substantial funds. Now, several EU countries are contemplating adopting OSS, with some already initiating the transition. This topic warrants examination from various angles, including economic, technological, pedagogical, sociological, cultural, and legal aspects. This paper presents a comparison between Microsoft Windows and Linux operating systems, a current hot topic in the IT world regarding their applicability and superiority. It also scrutinizes the technological rivalry between Open Source and proprietary software code, considering their origin and development philosophy. To demonstrate the compatibility of these systems with the same hardware as their competitors, we conducted tests that indicate both systems' feasibility on identical hardware architectures.
