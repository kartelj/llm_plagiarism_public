During the rapid advancement of information technologies, their application in education has significantly increased. Numerous educational institutions have adopted the DLS education platform, often to supplement traditional education. However, an escalating number of tertiary institutions worldwide, including our own, have embraced this form of learning and established distance education programs. This paper aims to provide an overview of the current quality of DLS e-learning systems. It explores the evolution of e-learning models and suggests potential future directions. The implementation of learning management systems, intelligent tutoring systems, and adaptive educational hypermedia systems in education has led to a wealth of information on student learning methods. Learning Management Systems (LMS) are utilized to create, organize, implement, and administer online courses and training programs, irrespective of their specific location and time of operation. Moodle (Modular Object Dynamic Learning Environment), an open-source system based on a series of PHP modules installed on the Web server and MySQL, Postgres databases, is one of the most prevalent learning management systems. The study placed an emphasis on enhancing student performance during examinations and on the technical aspects of the e-learning system that could guarantee continuous system development amid the swift changes in information and communication technology development and implementation.
