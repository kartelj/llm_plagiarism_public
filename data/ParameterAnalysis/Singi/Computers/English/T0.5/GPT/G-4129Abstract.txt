The proposed work introduces an innovative method for cryptographically secure biometric authentication utilizing public key cryptography, a pseudo-random number generator, and cancelable biometrics. The biometric templates remain encrypted or can be canceled at all system use stages, except during feature extraction, providing protection against various attacks. The system doesn't require intensive computation and the biometric templates are of an acceptable size. This novel approach to cryptographically secure authentication is applied via a modular biometric system for verifying mobile banking users, using human eye iris biometrics. Both the system's performance and the randomness of the biometric templates and data transmitted over the network in this usage scenario receive positive evaluations based on realistic data.
