The fundamental principle for operating contemporary retail businesses is Customer Relationship Management (CRM). It is a critical component for the survival of retail businesses in the current business climate. The implementation of CRM in retail involves the establishment and preservation of enduring partnerships between businesses and their customers, with the aim of generating lifelong value for both parties. 

What sets CRM apart from other relationship management strategies is its ability to form unique relationships between retail businesses and their consumers. The management of customer relationship changes is heavily reliant on accurate information and understanding of customer needs, demands, and behaviors. It also hinges on the development of various modes of communication with customers, both verbal and non-verbal, personal and electronic.

Managing changes in customer relationships entails alterations in the behavior of organizations towards their customers and vice versa. Given the unpredictable and time-sensitive nature of business relationships between retailers and consumers, it is crucial for contemporary retailers to adopt a strategic approach to managing customer relationships in the long term.
