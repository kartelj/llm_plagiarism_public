The doctoral dissertation titled "Posthuman Gaze: Automated Images in Contemporary Cinema" explores the concept of automated images as a form of expression in modern cinema, viewed through the lens of new digital media modes. In today's digital age, the origin of moving images is often uncertain, whether they're generated by our computers, gadgets, or surveillance systems, these images are created automatically and algorithmically. The dissertation aims to investigate the impact of these seemingly random and autonomous images on contemporary cinema, viewing cinema as an artistic medium with inherent transdisciplinarity. The main goal is to analyze how postcinematic culture, characterized by a shift in power relations regarding film production and reception technologies, mirrors the relationship between humans and their societal, neoliberal, technocentric surroundings, closely tied to a posthumanist context. The dissertation's introduction lays out the methodological groundwork, which includes theoretical and empirical research, comprising a review and analysis of the theoretical framework based on an interdisciplinary approach. The first chapter sets the stage for theoretical approaches to automated images. The second chapter contextualizes automated images within posthumanist studies, and the third chapter provides the terminological and structural groundwork for analyzing automated images as a film medium. The subsequent three chapters delve into specific case studies analyzing automated images in modern cinema, including surveillance camera films, computer screen films, and landscape films as emerging genres and filmmaking trends. These case studies suggest a common trend of deconstructing traditional film narrative styles using unconventional methods to align with the currents of modern screen culture, necessitating a new understanding of contemporary viewing regimes. Consequently, the dissertation provides a critical framework for understanding the trends of modern digital cinema within the context of posthumanist discourse.
