The practice of using electricity transmission lines to transmit telecommunication signals began in the late 19th century. With the heavy investment in traditional telecommunication technologies, the concept of transmitting telecommunication signals, primarily for managing automatic regulation in substations, led to the research and development of Power Line Communication (PLC). Over time, the frequency band assigned to PLC communication in the CENELEC range (3 kHz to 148.5 kHz) was standardized, leading to widespread use of this narrowband two-way PLC communication in areas like remote electricity meter reading and consumption management. Hence, PLC technology is utilized in delivering communication services at the access level, or directly to the end user, the electricity consumers. 

In recent years, a variety of modern telecommunication technologies and services have been developed, which are provided by telecommunication operators to their customers. These customers are also electricity users, served by electricity distribution companies. Recognizing this, electricity distribution companies and PLC equipment manufacturers have invested in the development of Broadband PLC communications over the past 15 years. This technology uses the frequency band from 1.6 MHz to 30 MHz, allowing for higher data rates (up to 200 Mbps theoretically) to support broadband services like VoIP, VoD, and high-speed internet. By expanding their business in this direction, electricity distribution companies diversify their services and increase their competitiveness in the liberalized electricity market. 

This paper discusses the challenges and constraints encountered before the final commercialization of Broadband PLC Communication (BPL), and proposes technical solutions to overcome these issues. It also presents a project proposal and evaluation of indicators to verify the applicability of BPL technology in providing access telecommunication level and broadband services to end-users. 

The paper is organized into 10 chapters. After an introductory chapter that describes the research topic, motivation, goals, tasks, and expected contribution from the research results, the second chapter provides a detailed overview of the types of power lines in use and their characteristics in relation to providing telecommunication services. The third chapter presents an overview of the PLC system elements and theoretical analysis of their characteristics and impacts on PLC communication performance. The fourth chapter presents the classification of different topologies of low-voltage electricity distribution networks and describes the organization of PLC access networks. The fifth chapter categorizes and specifies the types of interference that occur in low voltage and medium voltage networks. It also introduces modulation techniques used in PLC systems. Chapter 6 discusses the techniques of switching of telecommunication traffic within the PLC system, and identifies an efficient MAC protocol for application in the PLC access network. The seventh chapter describes the types of multimedia content that are envisaged for transmission over the access broadband PLC network, as well as the quality requirements (QoS) for each of the multimedia content. Chapter 8 presents the regulatory aspect of the implementation of BPL technology and systems, globally, and through the regulatory framework in the Republic of Serbia. In the ninth chapter, a Project is proposed to identify indicators that would verify the applicability of BPL technology for the implementation of the access telecommunication level and the provision of broadband services to the end- users in the Republic of Serbia. The tenth and final chapter provides a systematic conclusion.
