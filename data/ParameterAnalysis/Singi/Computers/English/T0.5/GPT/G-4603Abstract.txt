This thesis explores the performance analysis of wireless transmission over α-k-µ-g and k-µ-g fading channels. It includes derived closed-form expressions for the probability density function (PDF) and cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for the observed channel. Standard performance metrics of the received signal, such as outage probability (OP) and level crossing rate (LCR), have been determined for this transmission scenario, based on different system parameters. The thesis also examines the enhancement of these performance measures when space diversity is employed at reception. Several space diversity methods, including selection combining (SC) and maximal-ratio combining (MRC), are discussed to highlight how the impact of fading can be minimized. The thesis further investigates the simultaneous occurrence of multipath fading and shadowing, and considers macro-diversity reception combining along with micro-diversity combining to counteract these detrimental effects and enhance reception signal quality. The findings of the thesis demonstrate that the proposed approach effectively reduces the harmful effects of observed α-k-µ-g and k-µ-g fading in various wireless transmission situations.
