Communication protection is of utmost importance for professional systems utilized by government, military, police, and security agencies. These systems cannot depend on publicly available protection systems, nor on security systems that have not been internally developed and whose operational principles or potential design and implementation flaws are known externally. To achieve the highest level of communication protection, these professional systems must create their own robust protection systems that can withstand all known forms of attacks. The comprehensive development of a communication system encompasses every component, from the user interface to the communication infrastructure. This development process calls for significant resources and investments, as well as adequate time for development, testing, and debugging. This paper discusses the potential use of publicly available communication infrastructures and technologies in developing a system that offers the highest possible level of communication protection. It also presents a detailed development process and the characteristics of a solution based on integrating proprietary ciphers at the network communication layer.
