The approaches of systems and processes, as well as structural and object-oriented modeling, yield the best results in design, development, and ICT security practice. The security processes of a system, which convert inputs into outputs and ideally enhance the value of output parameters, incorporate procedures, tools, and competent, motivated individuals to carry out security-related tasks. Continuous evaluation and enhancement of these security processes is crucial, as owners, managers, and regular users often lack sufficient security awareness, and security technologies and experts are relatively costly. 

Process-oriented standards and models, particularly those based on the Capability Maturity Model (CMM) and the System Security Engineering Capability Maturity Model (SSE CMM), have been developed to assess quality and track the progress of process maturation and improvement. Comparative analyses of the correlation between standards and models, based on system, process, or environment approaches, suggest several opportunities to establish a more comprehensive framework for process evaluation and improvement. 

The CMMs that integrate processes, such as SSE CMM and CMMI, offer a unified framework for evaluating and enhancing various processes. The SSE CMM integrates 11 SSE, 5 project management, and 6 organizational process areas. In the SSE CMM, the quality and maturity of process performance are measured by a specific system and process-oriented metric, based on the performance and implementation criteria of basic (BP) and generic (GP) practices. The SSE CMM metric classifies the capability (CL) and maturity (ML) levels into five active levels. 

The System Security Appraisal Method (SSAM), based on the SSE CMM model, is specifically designed to perform a verification-type evaluation that not only uncovers but also verifies objective data on the performance and implementation of BP and GP practices. Experimental evaluation of current ESS processes across three evaluated projects, along with the proposal of a process improvement action plan, confirms the declared user acceptability and applicability of the SSE CMM model and the SSAM method for evaluating and improving security processes. This is essential for optimal security program development, security organization profiling, and a number of other ICT security applications.
