The adaptive e-education process's complexity has resulted in limited research papers examining its methodological and integrated system development aspects. Therefore, this paper's content holds unique value and contributes significantly to this field. E-education is a multifaceted system encompassing distance learning and teaching, diverse teaching materials, individual and group learning, tutoring, and interactive work. It's crucial to consider students' preferences and learning styles to enhance e-education systems' efficiency and effectiveness. Various sources, including business information systems, distance education systems, surveys, and teachers' subjective assessments, provide data to identify these preferences. This data is then used to adapt the system, a process that modifies the system based on the student's knowledge. The primary objectives of an e-education system's adaptation include improving course design and utility, increasing student loyalty, aiding information retrieval about the course, and advanced search and storage of search results in line with students' interests. This dissertation posits and substantiates the main hypothesis that incorporating an adaptive model in the LMS system of e-education can improve the educational process, elevate the quality of e-education's business processes, and justify the induction expense. The proposed adaptive model can address remote education challenges, such as tailoring teaching material to students' needs, implementing a quality reporting system based on learning management systems data, and establishing an electronic learning portal, among others. This leads to increased student enrollment and graduation, reduced costs, more efficient fund utilization, and improved decision-making. This doctoral dissertation delves into the application of adaptive methods and techniques in e-education, aiming to develop an adaptive model for the Programming for Internet subject. The experimental component was executed as an adaptive electronic course for JAVA programming at the Informatics laboratory of the Professional Studies College of Technology in Sabac, Serbia. Standard statistical methods were used to measure relevant parameters and analyze the results. The research findings indicate that students who participated in the adapted course through the demonstrated methods and techniques performed better than those in the non-adapted course.
