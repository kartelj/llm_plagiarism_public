In today's world, numerous swarm intelligence algorithms are effectively utilized to tackle a range of challenging optimization problems. These algorithms all share common elements, such as the operator for local search (exploitation) which focuses on promising solutions, and the global search (exploration) operator that aids in avoiding local optima. Initial testing of these algorithms is usually conducted on unconstrained, constrained, or high-dimensional sets of standard test functions. They can then be enhanced, adapted, modified, hybridized, and combined with local search. The ultimate goal is to apply these metaheuristics to real-world optimization problems. 

The solution domains or search spaces for these complex optimization problems can vary. Solutions may be vectors of real or integer numbers, or they could be more complex structures. Adapting swarm intelligence algorithms for different search spaces may involve simple adjustments of algorithm parameters or adaptations for integer solutions by rounding the obtained real solutions. However, in some instances, the algorithm may need to be almost entirely restructured, including the exploitation and exploration operators, while maintaining only the guiding process or swarm intelligence. 

This dissertation presents several swarm intelligence algorithms and their adaptations for different search spaces and their application to practical problems. The dissertation aims to analyze and adapt swarm intelligence algorithms based on the fitness function and search space. It provides a thorough review of existing implementations of swarm intelligence algorithms, a comparative analysis, and a discussion of the strengths and weaknesses of certain algorithms compared to others. It also explores how swarm intelligence algorithms can be adapted for different search spaces and applied to practical problems.

Real solution problems like support vector machine optimization and clustering, integer solution problems like digital image segmentation, and special structure solutions like robot path planning and minimum weight triangulation are considered. Modified and adapted swarm intelligence algorithms for different search spaces have been tested on standard test data sets and compared with other contemporary methods from literature. The results show successful adaptations of swarm intelligence algorithms for various search spaces, with these adaptations achieving superior results in all cases compared to the methods from literature. This suggests that it's feasible to adapt swarm intelligence algorithms for various search spaces, including complex structures, and achieve superior results compared to existing methods.
