This study aims to evaluate the level of competitiveness in Serbia's economy, the effectiveness of its competitiveness policy, and the role of clusters in enhancing regional competitiveness. The methodologies employed to test these hypotheses were developed by the World Economic Forum, the Center for Strategy and Competitiveness at the University of Stockholm, and the European Cluster Observatory. The study also sought to establish the relationship between the strength of clusters in various regions, as measured by the location quotient, and GDP per capita as a productivity indicator, in five countries, namely Hungary, Bulgaria, Greece, Romania, and Serbia, collectively referred to as G-5. The data used for this study was sourced from the Statistical Office of Serbia, EUROSTAT, the World Economic Forum, and the European Cluster Observatory. The findings reveal a decline in Serbia's competitiveness indicators, particularly when compared to other countries at a similar development level. The measures taken to enhance competitiveness are found to be inadequate. In the G-5 countries, a positive correlation was found between the strength of clusters in the regions and regional competitiveness in 13 out of 20 cluster categories analyzed.
