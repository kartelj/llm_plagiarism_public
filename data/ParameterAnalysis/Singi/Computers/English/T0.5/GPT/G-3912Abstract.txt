The terms accessible tourism, barrier-free tourism, and inclusive tourism all refer to tourism tailored to all consumer types. This concept, while relatively new and under-researched in our local market, is globally recognized for its potential and has received considerable attention through scientific studies, research, and adjustments in tourism offerings for these specific clients. The challenge for the entire tourism industry lies in providing products and services in an environment that caters to all users. 

By keeping up with global trends in tourism and implementing numerous laws and regulations, including alignment with EU legislation, we can ensure equal opportunities for these clients in all social activities, including leisure time. Accessibility is a crucial component of any responsible and sustainable tourism policy and strategy, necessitating national-level efforts and investments in the accessibility of all tourism-related industries. 

Being aware of and adhering to regulations not only supports human rights but also presents a business opportunity. However, it requires a shift in thinking and service delivery models. This paper focuses on hotel services designed to cater to the needs of accessible tourism users. 

An accessible environment and services contribute to improving the quality of hotel products, thereby enhancing the overall competitiveness of tourism destinations. The research results analyzed in this paper reveal the attitudes of Belgrade's accessible hotel management towards accessible tourism. The paper also examines their attitudes towards accessible tourism consumers, the range of services tailored to them, human resources policies, and the promotion of accessible accommodation. 

The research aims to understand the management's perception of how accessible tourism contributes to their business success.
