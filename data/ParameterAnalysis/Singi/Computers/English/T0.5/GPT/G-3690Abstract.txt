Digital images and their processing have greatly contributed to significant advancements in the field of medicine. The utilization of computers to process medical digital images can expediently expedite the diagnostic process by revealing minute tissue changes that are undetectable to the human eye. Medical image processing encompasses images produced from various sources such as X-ray, ultrasound, magnetic resonance, and captured by different devices like scanners, microscopic images, endoscopic capsules, among others. The continuous advancement in medical imaging technology has resulted in high-resolution images, and three-dimensional anatomical and physiological images. However, this progress has also brought about new challenges and issues in medical image processing. Many of these issues represent complex optimization problems that have been successfully addressed by nature-inspired algorithms, particularly swarm intelligence algorithms, for over two decades. To utilize these algorithms for medical digital image processing optimization issues, they need to be adjusted and modified for specific problems. This area is a vibrant field of research, as evidenced by the numerous scientific and professional articles, books, journals, and conferences dedicated to it. This thesis presents several swarm intelligence algorithms and their application to a variety of medical digital image processing optimization problems. Specifically, the bat algorithm, fireworks algorithm, and firefly algorithm were employed for retina image registration, brain MRI segmentation, bleeding detection in endoscopic capsule images, image compression, leukemia detection in microscopic images, and emphysema detection in CT lung images. Each problem considered is unique, and swarm intelligence algorithms have been tailored to address them. Modified and customized swarm intelligence algorithms for use in medical digital image processing were tested on standard benchmark test images compiled for the problems in question. A comparison of the proposed methods for enhancing medical digital image processing using swarm intelligence algorithms with other cutting-edge algorithms from literature showed superior results. This suggests that by adjusting and applying swarm intelligence algorithms, better methods and techniques for solving optimization problems encountered during the analysis and processing of medical digital images can be developed.
