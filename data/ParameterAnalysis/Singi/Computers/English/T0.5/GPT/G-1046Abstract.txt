Modern electronic system users have confidence in the high level of personal data and resource protection. They trust that the service provider has taken all necessary measures to prevent any failures. The complex system of protection and user administration often deters users from utilizing available market services. To ensure top-notch professional care, communication systems have devised their own protective systems that can withstand all known types of attacks. However, these professional systems must strike a balance between functionality and user protection. Their services are adapted to familiar infrastructures and are usually safeguarded with the SSL/TLS protocol using user-known data like usernames and passwords. This has resulted in a balance between functionality and security, but safety rules and authentication based on what a user has and who the user is are often overlooked. This paper explores the potential of implementing a solution that doesn't compromise system functionality while introducing the principle of secure authentication based on what a user has. It details the development process and characteristics of solutions guided by these principles, thereby enhancing the reliability of multi-channel SSL/TLS authentication.
