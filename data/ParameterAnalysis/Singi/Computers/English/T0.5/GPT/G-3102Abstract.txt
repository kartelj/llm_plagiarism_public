Cloud computing security is a multifaceted and intricate issue, intersecting with various fields such as computer network security, computer security, information security and legal regulation implementation, among others. Despite its significant advantages, the complexity of its security is a major deterrent to its widespread usage. One of the most secure methods of data preservation in the cloud is the use of cryptographic techniques. However, the safety of the encrypted data stored in the cloud relies solely on the security of the cryptographic algorithms used and the keys' security. A downside to storing data in the cloud as ciphertext is the inability to process the data within the cloud without decrypting it, posing a security risk. Homomorphic cryptosystems offer a potential solution to this problem, allowing data processing in an encrypted form, with the processed result also being encrypted. Only those with the keys can decrypt this. Some consider this the 'holy grail' of cryptography. The academic community is currently investing significant effort into researching and enhancing encryption methods that allow ciphertext processing in the cloud. We have observed a lack of exploration into the relationship between the encryption method used in the cloud and systems with limited computational resources, and we believe there is significant potential for its application in everyday life. In this dissertation, we have explored how homomorphic encryption can be safely used to harness the cloud's potential applications. We present the basic ideas that motivated our research, define our scientific research hypotheses, outline the methods we will use, and list our expected scientific contributions. The dissertation further delves into the historical development and definition of cloud computing, explains the concept of homomorphism in cipher systems, discusses enhancing encryption key security using a virtual file system, and details our scientific contributions. We propose an experiment to model the problem and suggest a simpler model. The implementation of the proposed solutions is discussed, with the solutions being realized on two different platforms: the Raspberyy Pi industrial computer and Android mobile phones. The thesis concludes by summarizing our scientific contributions and suggesting potential directions for future research in this field.
