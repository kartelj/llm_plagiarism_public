The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) has suggested the use of XML as a standard for web applications, transactions, documentation, database management systems, and for exchanging information over the Internet. XML has the ability to store various types of data without affecting how it will be displayed. It's been employed to create, update, and query databases. The creation and writing of clear, human-readable and machine-readable XML documents is straightforward, making it easy to develop applications that process these documents. Essentially, any type of information can be represented as an XML document. 

In recent times, there has been a significant increase in the amount of Arabic content online and the number of Arabic-speaking internet users. With over 375 million speakers worldwide, Arabic is a widely spoken language. More than 40% of these speakers, approximately 155 million people, use the internet, accounting for almost 5% of all internet users globally. The number of Arabic-speaking internet users has increased sixtyfold in the past fifteen years (2000-2015). This surge in usage has outpaced the development of information retrieval systems, Arabic text summarization (like documents and web pages), query processes, and natural language processors.

Arabic words can have different forms of syntax and morphologies, each with distinct meanings. Documents often contain various forms of words, including derivatives, leading to issues in text processing, document summarization, and information retrieval systems. Moreover, there is a significant loss of information during querying, document summarizing, and information retrieval processes, especially with larger documents since information loss is directly proportional to document size during these processes. 

This thesis presents the design of an RAX System for ranking Arabic documents during information retrieval processes. The proposed solution primarily relies on the similarity of textual content. Our designed model can be applied to documents stored in various formats and written in Arabic. Given the complex linguistic semantics of Arabic, the proposed solution utilizes a purely statistical approach. The design and implementation are based on existing text processing frameworks and Arabic grammar references. Our research has mainly focused on evaluating different similarity measures used for classifying Arabic documents from various domains and document categories based on user-provided query criteria. 

Additionally, the thesis will explore the security aspects of the RAX system, including XML security (XML digital signature and XML encryption) and the SOAP message, to establish a secure environment between an end user and the RAX system model. It will also examine potential security attacks and countermeasures. 

Keywords: Text similarity measures, Text classification, Processing Arabic documents, XML Documents, Securing XML Documents.
