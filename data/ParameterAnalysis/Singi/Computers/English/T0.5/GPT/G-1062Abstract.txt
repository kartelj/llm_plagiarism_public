The dissertation focuses on exploring models of e-business systems interoperability through the lens of service-oriented software development, viewed from various angles. The study examines standards, interoperability frameworks, enterprise information systems architecture, semantic technologies underpinned by ontologies, and service orientation. By evaluating the current situation, best practices, and emerging trends, the dissertation proposes solutions to interoperability issues. These include a methodological framework for ad-hoc connections of e-business systems, a universal meta model to ensure semantic coherence of the system and the description and discovery of components in e-business systems, and a service-oriented architecture model for ad-hoc semantic interoperability of business processes. The research's validity was confirmed by improving interoperability and business process execution in the cultural heritage protection sector. The results have enhanced the utilization of information, documents, and visual materials related to various cultural artifacts.
