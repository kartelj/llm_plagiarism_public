The need for faster data transfer rates for multimedia and stricter copyright protection measures in today's society is becoming more evident. In this regard, Free Space Optics (FSO) communications present a strong alternative to traditional wireless communication systems. Wherever feasible, these systems offer users exceptionally high performance, with data transfer rates reaching several gigabytes and virtually unparalleled security options. Due to its cost-effective implementation, it is practical and important for the "last mile" connection. This study investigates the potential of transmitting images via FSO communication channels under scintillation conditions. It examines the transfer of copyright-protected data (watermarked images) and the influence of FSO channels on their degradation, degradation or protection code, as well as the detection of fires in color images after transmission over FSO communication channels.
