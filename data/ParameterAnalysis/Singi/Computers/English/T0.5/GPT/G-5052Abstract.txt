This thesis introduces a category of systems that produce and distribute cryptographic keys using multiple biometric methods. The theoretical model includes two biometric methods: fingerprints and iris scans. During operation, the system utilizes the hash values obtained during the initial, or enrollment, phase. Alongside these values, supplementary data is used to make the biometric information revocable, thereby safeguarding the privacy of this data. This also provides protection for cryptographic parameters. Iris biometrics, which hold the most bio-information, are used to derive the secret key, while fingerprints are used for verification. The experimental evaluation, which covers the entirety of the research aspect of the dissertation, is based on samples from the CASIA biometric database. The experimental outcomes show significant advancements that greatly enhance the performance of this category of systems.
