The interplay between supply and demand in the hotel industry is largely influenced by the marketing strategies of hotel firms. This paper examines hotels in Serbia, which are characterized by a diverse range of facilities and services, setting them apart from each other and their international competitors. Recent investments have transformed the image of 4 and 5 star hotels in Serbia, showcasing them in a contemporary, elegant and well-equipped manner. This study will scrutinize the current standing of 4 and 5 star Serbian hotels on Facebook and assess the role and significance of Internet Distribution Systems (IDS) in sales, as well as their effect on service quality. It will also highlight the changes in the Serbian hotel sector due to the emergence of IDS and explore the connection between these systems and the industry. Two empirical studies were conducted, involving mid and senior-level managers and guests of the hotels under investigation. The gathered data was processed using IBM SPSS Statistics 22, employing descriptive statistics, Student's t test, chi square test, Importance Performance Analysis and Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). Secondary data for the promotional study was analyzed using Simply Measured tools.
