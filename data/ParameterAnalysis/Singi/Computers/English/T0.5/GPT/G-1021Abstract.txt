Given that Earth is home to over 7 billion people, with projections for a population of around 9 billion by 2050, identifying individuals while maintaining their privacy is a significant challenge. In the interest of collective security, many governments and security agencies have prioritized biometric identification as a key requirement. Numerous private companies have also entered the field of biometric identification technology, recognizing the lucrative market that was once exclusive to the government sector. 

The United States, despite economic difficulties, has invested heavily in improving biometric identification, particularly following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. China, with its rapidly growing economy and status as the most populous country, is also making significant strides in developing biometric identification mechanisms. In contrast, India's motivation for introducing biometric identification technology is not security-related but instead deals with the critical issue of food distribution. The European Union, led by the Netherlands, is also heavily invested in developing and implementing biometric identification. 

The privacy of biometric data largely depends on the policies and attitudes of the organizations responsible for collecting and storing the data, as well as the methods used to protect it. Even when these organizations are trusted state institutions, the potential for abuse remains a constant threat. Balancing security and privacy is a subject of ongoing research worldwide. 

Over the past few decades, various approaches to this problem have been proposed, with the advancement of information technology enabling new solutions. It's important to note that biometric data is "noisy", meaning it doesn't always present consistently, making certain principles of classical logic inapplicable in this field. Similarly, cryptographic procedures using biometric data are unfeasible since biometric data doesn't meet the necessary criteria for cryptography. 

Fuzzy Logic provides a new approach that aligns closely with human thought processes and has been used in numerous proposed solutions for biometric identification. Some of these solutions suggest extracting cryptographic keys directly from biometric data using fuzzy extractor functions, which account for the uncertainty of biometric data measurements. 

However, these solutions have their limitations. For example, biometric features appear in an unprotected format during the decoding process in solutions using fuzzy sketch. Moreover, the decryption process for fuzzy sketch is not reliable enough for practical applications. 

Other solutions propose creating a cryptographic key independently, meeting all cryptographic requirements, and then combining it with the biometric data. These solutions yield better results than those using a fuzzy sketch, with various error-correcting methods used to compensate for the fuzziness of the biometric data. 

This paper proposes a solution that uses fingerprints as biometric data. After identifying and distinguishing the unique points of the fingerprint, two independent templates are created. The first is used for identification, while the second combines biometrics with a pre-constructed cryptographic key that has been processed with error correction encoding. 

Both templates are stored on a token like a card with a microprocessor. During the reconstruction of the cryptographic key, the original fingerprint must be present. After positive identification, the key is reconstructed by separating it from the fingerprint and reapplying error correction encoding to correct any errors. 

This proposed solution significantly reduces identification errors and improves the security of the original fingerprint image, which remains hidden throughout the process. It is also resistant to a wide range of potential attacks aimed at compromising biometric data and, by extension, personal identity.
