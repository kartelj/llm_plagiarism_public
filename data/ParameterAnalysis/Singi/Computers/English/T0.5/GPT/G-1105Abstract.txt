The doctoral thesis, "Laser Perception of Defined Objects, Commands Encapsulation, and Control Elements for the Modern Robotized Teaching Tool," presents a practical framework for creating a modern robotic educational tool. This proposed system includes features like the use of lasers for object recognition on the robotic platform, multi-control modules, and experimental dissertation. The focus is on three main areas: the design and construction of the laser sensor group, the creation of a programmable control module and logic controllers, and the development of a self-propelled robotic platform. These modules can operate independently but when combined, they form an excellent foundation for experimentation.
