Studies indicate that end users have largely shifted their focus from social networking to communication platforms such as Viber, WhatsApp, FB Messenger, Instagram, and more. Artificial intelligence, coupled with the concept of digital transformation, plays a significant role in modernizing businesses across various industries. Amidst the COVID-19 pandemic and the creation of innovative solutions offering added value, the chatbot was introduced to the digital world. This software mimics human conversation, guiding users to accurate information and simplifying everyday services. Over the past ten years, the tremendous advancement of communication platforms and networking technologies has offered new technical opportunities for the implementation of chatbots in diverse sectors, including e-commerce, customer support, marketing, and education.

A chatbot is a software program that simulates conversation using artificial intelligence, engaging in dialogue with humans through natural language understanding via text and voice messages. It utilizes artificial intelligence to find answers and address user queries. In line with current trends, a methodological framework for the development of modern chatbot architecture based on artificial intelligence for the next generation of internet users is outlined. The biggest challenge in developing the adaptive platform is resolving the issue of integration flexibility, defining the mechanism of chatbot independence from a single natural language understanding (NLU) service to ensure adequate adaptability.

The suggested methodology offers a universal procedure and is the result of merging various methodological approaches. As per the defined methodology, the process of developing an adaptive chatbot based on NLU is divided into two primary phases: project engineering and application engineering, each further divided into activities. The benefit of this separation is the realization of an adaptable platform for generating chatbots. A proposed scalable and expandable chatbot architecture supports different services for natural language understanding and communication channels. The paper details the logical and physical architecture of chatbots. Independence from the NLU service is guaranteed through suitable metamodels and their mapping rules.

The thesis presents an independent framework to lessen reliance on suppliers providing services for natural language understanding and communication channels. This approach ensures independence from any service for understanding natural language, avoiding the solution being tied to a single service. The proposed mechanism allows for easy mapping and switching from one to another new NLU service. Lastly, the proposed solution is illustrated through a case study.

The Academic Digital Assistant (ADA) is the first educational project in the Balkans that enhances communication, saves time, and delivers services more quickly and efficiently. ADA receives messages from various messaging communication platforms and performs several crucial tasks before forwarding a message to the NLU. The NLU analyzes the text using machine learning techniques and generates intent and its entities. The result is sent back to the chatbot platform, which uses an algorithm of intent, entities, and context to send a response to the user in the appropriate format. Available 24/7, ADA provides answers to frequently asked questions from students and prospective students. It knows over 250 scenarios related to questions an appropriate service that students want to be performed, including exam registration, change of examiner, semester certification, and more.
