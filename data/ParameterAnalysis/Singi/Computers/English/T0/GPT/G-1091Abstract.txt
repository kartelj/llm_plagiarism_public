Government, military, police, and security agencies require the highest level of communication protection for their professional systems. They cannot depend on publicly available protection systems or those not developed within their organization, as any known operational principles or potential design and implementation flaws could compromise security. To achieve maximum communication protection, these professional systems must create their own robust protection systems resistant to all known attack types. This comprehensive development process involves every level, from the user interface to the communication infrastructure, necessitating significant resources, investments, and time for development, testing, and debugging. This paper explores the potential use of public communication infrastructures and technologies to develop a system offering the highest level of communication protection. It presents a detailed development process and the characteristics of a solution based on integrating proprietary ciphers on the network communication layer.
