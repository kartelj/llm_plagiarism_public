The aim of this research is to assess the competitiveness of Serbia's economy, the efficacy of its competitiveness policies, and the role of clusters in enhancing regional competitiveness. The methodologies employed to evaluate these hypotheses were developed by the World Economic Forum, the Center for Strategy and Competitiveness at the University of Stockholm, and the European Cluster Observatory. The goal of the analysis on how robust clusters contribute to regional competitiveness was to identify a correlation between the strength of clusters in various regions, as measured by the location quotient, and GDP per capita as a productivity indicator, in the following five countries, also known as G-5: Hungary, Bulgaria, Greece, Romania, and Serbia. The data used in this research was sourced from the Statistical Office of Serbia, EUROSTAT, the World Economic Forum, and the European Cluster Observatory. The findings of the analysis indicate a decline in Serbia's competitiveness indicators, particularly when compared to other countries at a similar development stage, and that the measures for competitiveness policy are inadequate and ineffective. In the G-5 countries, a positive correlation was found between the strength of clusters in the regions and regional competitiveness in 13 out of 20 cluster categories analyzed.
