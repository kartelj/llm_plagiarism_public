The study introduces a unique method for cryptographically secure biometric authentication, utilizing public key cryptography, a pseudo-random number generator, and cancelable biometrics. Except for the feature extraction stage, biometric templates are either encrypted or cancelable throughout the system's usage, enhancing its security against various attacks. The system is not overly taxing computationally, and the biometric templates' size is reasonable. This cryptographically secure authentication method is applied via a modular biometric system for mobile banking user verification, leveraging human eye iris biometrics. The system's performance, the randomness of the biometric templates, and the data transmitted over the network in this usage scenario receive positive evaluations based on realistic data.
