The increasing demand for higher data transfer rates for multimedia and stricter copyright protection measures in today's society is becoming more evident. In this scenario, Free Space Optics (FSO) communications present a viable alternative to traditional wireless communication systems. Wherever feasible, these systems offer users exceptionally high performance, with data transfer rates reaching several gigabytes and virtually unparalleled security options. Due to their cost-effective implementation, they are practical and significant for "last mile" connections. This study investigates the potential of transmitting images via FSO communication channels under scintillation conditions. It examines the transmission of copyright-protected data (watermarked images) and the effect of FSO channels on their degradation, protection code degradation, as well as the detection of fires in color images post-transmission over FSO communication channels.
