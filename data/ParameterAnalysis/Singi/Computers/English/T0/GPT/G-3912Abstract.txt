Tourism that is accessible to all types of consumers, also known as accessible tourism, access tourism, barrier-free tourism, or inclusive tourism, is a relatively new concept in our domestic market. However, its potential is globally recognized and has been extensively studied and researched. The tourism industry faces the significant challenge of providing products and services in an environment that is accessible to all users. By following global tourism trends and aligning laws and strategies with EU legislation, these consumers are ensured equal participation in all social activities, including leisure time. Accessibility must be a key component of any responsible and sustainable tourism policy and strategy, necessitating national-level investment in the accessibility of all tourism-related industries. Being aware of and complying with regulations is not only a human rights issue, but also a business opportunity. However, a shift in mindset and service delivery model is crucial. This paper focuses on hotel services designed to cater to the needs of accessible tourism users. An accessible environment and services enhance the quality of the hotel product, thereby increasing the overall competitiveness of tourism destinations. The paper analyzes the attitudes of Belgrade's accessible hotel management towards accessible tourism, the range of services tailored to these consumers, HR policies, and the promotion of accessible accommodation. The research aims to understand management's perception of the impact of accessible tourism on their business success.
