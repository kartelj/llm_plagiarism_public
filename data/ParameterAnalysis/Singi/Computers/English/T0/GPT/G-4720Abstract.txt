Culture's perpetuation shapes society, which is constructed through the enhancement and progression of culture and knowledge. Education serves as the tool for societal improvement, with the evaluation of acquired knowledge and practical skills being a crucial aspect of it. Among all natural and technical sciences, computer science frequently employs assessments to gauge students' practical skills. Various assessment methods are used in education, with efforts being made to refine these methods for precise and unbiased evaluation. Both outdated and current methods are documented in literature, with the most prevalent being closed question type tests and practical work reviews and assessments. Tests are beneficial for gauging knowledge levels, while practical work reviews are useful for assessing practical skills levels. Both methods can be executed manually or automatically, with automated methods necessitating setups that allow for examiner-free execution. Professional experience suggests that manual student assessment, regardless of the method, struggles to achieve the necessary neutrality and accuracy, making automated assessments a recommended option. However, using these methods to determine both knowledge and practical skills levels presents a challenge due to their incompatibility. This paper reviews literature to explore common problems and aims to find an accurate and objective assessment method for students' practical skills in programming-related subjects. Over the study's four-year span, two student generations were tested using two distinct solutions. One method employed an electronic multichoice test for knowledge assessment, while the other analyzed the correctness of students' practical work. The paper answers several research questions based on data collected from these two assessment methods, using both quantitative and qualitative analysis. It also includes case studies of the assessment methods used for these evaluations and data collection during the research period. The paper investigates the potential of creating a tool that can automate the review and evaluation of practical works, replacing the teacher as the examiner. It also compares the assessment results' similarity from both methods, discusses the usefulness of tests for practical skills level determination, and explores the possibility of providing an unbiased assessment free from examiner influence. The paper concludes with discussions of the analyzed data and research findings. It proposes a method for objectively and accurately assessing practical skills levels in programming-related computer science subjects at the bachelor academic level and presents solutions for achieving this goal. This research contributes both scientifically and practically.
