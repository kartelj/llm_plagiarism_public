The history of using electricity transmission lines for telecommunication signal transmission dates back to the late 19th century. The concept of transmitting these signals, mainly for automatic regulation management in substations, led to the development of Power Line Communication (PLC). Over time, the PLC communication frequency band in the CENELEC range (3 kHz to 148.5 kHz) was standardized. This narrowband two-way PLC communication has been widely used in remote electricity meter reading and consumption management. Thus, PLC technology is employed for communication services at the access level, or directly to the end user - the electricity consumers. 

In recent years, a variety of modern telecommunication technologies and services have been developed, which are provided by telecommunication operators to their customers, who are also electricity users. Recognizing this, electricity distribution companies and PLC equipment manufacturers have invested in the development of Broadband PLC communications over the past 15 years. This involves the use of the frequency band from 1.6 MHz to 30 MHz, enabling higher data rates (up to 200 Mbps theoretically) to support broadband services like VoIP, VoD, and high-speed Internet. By expanding their services in this direction, electricity distribution companies diversify and become more competitive in the liberalized electricity market. 

This paper discusses the challenges and constraints faced before the final commercialization of Broadband PLC Communication (BPL), and proposes technical solutions to overcome these. It also presents a specific project and evaluation of indicators to verify the applicability of BPL technology for access telecommunication level and broadband service provision to end-users. 

The paper is structured in 10 chapters. The first chapter introduces the research topic, motivation, goals, tasks, and expected contributions. The second chapter provides a detailed overview of the types of power lines and their characteristics in terms of providing telecommunication services. The third section presents an overview of the PLC system elements and theoretical analysis of their impacts on PLC communication performance. The fourth chapter presents the classification of different topologies of low-voltage electricity distribution networks. The fifth chapter categorizes and specifies the types of interference that occur in low voltage and medium voltage networks. Chapter 6 describes the techniques of switching of telecommunication traffic within the PLC system. The seventh chapter describes the types of multimedia content that are envisaged for transmission over the access broadband PLC network. Chapter 8 presents the regulatory aspect of the implementation of BPL technology and systems. In the ninth chapter, a Project is proposed to identify indicators that would be the basis for verifying the applicability of BPL technology. The last chapter concludes the paper.
