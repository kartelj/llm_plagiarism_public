Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs) are self-organizing networks comprised of nodes that connect wirelessly without the need for a centralized administration. These networks are currently a significant area of research due to their wide range of applications, such as military and emergency services. In MANETs, each node functions as both a host and a router, necessitating the ability to forward packets to other nodes. The frequent changes in network topologies due to node mobility necessitate specialized routing protocols for MANETs, as traditional ones used in wired networks are inefficient. This thesis aims to investigate and compare the existing routing protocols for MANETs. The three primary categories of these protocols are reactive, proactive, and hybrid. After examining the pros and cons of each, a new protocol, OLSR-BF, is suggested. This proactive routing protocol is primarily based on the existing OLSR routing protocol, with modifications primarily involving the use of the Bellman-Ford algorithm to determine the shortest distance between nodes within a MANET network. The design and performance of the new routing protocol are validated by qualitatively comparing it with existing AODV, DSDV, and OLSR routing protocols.
