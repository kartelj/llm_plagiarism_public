Having constant access to improvements in product, service, and software quality allows organizations to adapt swiftly to rapid changes typical of modern market economies. The ability to remain competitive in the market is achieved through ongoing enhancements in product, service, and software quality. Quality enhancement can only be realized by managing all the elements that influence the process input quality. In this study, we will consider the product as the "outcome of a specific process", which includes: 1) product; 2) service and 3) software. This study will present the methodology for establishing and evaluating user requirements and defining the elements that influence process input - factors that affect the satisfaction of these needs. The process of product realization involves numerous factors that affect the quality and satisfaction of user requirements, making product quality management complex. There are always multiple alternative solutions for enhancing product quality. Each improvement solution is characterized by specific implementation costs and varying effects on product quality. While it's easy to determine the implementation costs for each solution, the challenge lies in determining the effect of improving a specific factor on product quality, and indirectly on user satisfaction. The question is how to select the optimal combination of factors that affect product quality given limited financial resources. What will be the effect of enhancing certain factors that affect product quality? To analyze the effect of enhancing factors that affect product quality on the final product's compliance with user requirements, we will use the compliance of the final product simulation using Markov's process with the assistance of the Matlab programming language. This study significantly contributes to the improvement of modeling methodology and management of factors that affect product quality. A notable contribution of this study is its societal contribution and ability to address practical problems in business systems related to process quality improvement that influence the satisfaction of requirements. The research results can serve as a foundation for decision-making regarding the direction to take to enhance product quality. Key words: quality, product quality, process input elements, factors that affect product quality, quality improvement, Markov's processes, quality improvement effects simulation.
