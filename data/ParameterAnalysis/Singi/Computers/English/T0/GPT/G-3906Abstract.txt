The cloud computing model, similar to the network computing model, relies on resource clustering and the use of network and Internet technologies. Essentially, cloud computing is a novel method of providing computing resources as a service, including data, software, and hardware components like processing elements, memory, and storage. It's a significant and current multidisciplinary field, with numerous papers published in top-tier international journals and presented at prestigious international conferences. 

Based on the scientific findings from these papers, it's clear that the cloud environment presents numerous challenges and issues that can be more effectively addressed with improved methods, techniques, and algorithms. One of the key challenges in cloud computing is scheduling end users' requests on a limited set of resources (virtual machines). This scheduling problem involves creating a task execution schedule on a limited set of resources, considering potential constraints and the objective function. 

Scheduling is done using algorithms, which can be static or dynamic. Static scheduling doesn't allow for dynamic task switching from overused to underused virtual machines, with tasks allocated for execution on available virtual machines before the scheduling algorithm is run. Dynamic scheduling methods, also known as load balancing approaches, allocate workload between active virtual machines during the scheduling algorithm's runtime. Tasks are redistributed by dynamically switching from overused to less used virtual machines. Heuristic and metaheuristic optimization methods are commonly used for dynamic scheduling, where they've shown excellent results. 

Task scheduling and load balancing issues in cloud computing are part of the NP hard combinatorial and/or global problems group, with or without constraints. According to published results, swarm intelligence metaheuristics have been successfully tested on benchmark and practical NP hard optimization problems, outperforming other methods, techniques, and algorithms in terms of convergence speed and solution quality. 

This doctoral thesis explores whether task scheduling and load balancing in the cloud computing environment can be further improved using swarm intelligence metaheuristics. Several swarm intelligence metaheuristics were enhanced and adapted for solving task scheduling and load balancing problems in the cloud environment. The implementation of two improved swarm intelligence algorithms - the monarch butterfly optimization algorithm and whale optimization algorithm - are presented in the dissertation. 

Two task scheduling models were considered: a single-objective optimization model aiming to minimize all tasks' execution time on the cloud, and a multi-objective optimization model aiming to minimize both the execution time of all tasks on the cloud and the total cost of utilized cloud resources. 

Simulations were conducted in a robust CloudSim simulator environment, and both algorithms were tested against artificial data (generated within the CloudSim platform) and real data (from a globally available benchmark database). In addition to testing swarm intelligence algorithms on practical cloud problems, the improved algorithms were also validated by conducting simulations on standard benchmark sets for unconstrained global optimization. 

By comparing the results (solution quality and convergence rate) of improved metaheuristics with the results of the best known metaheuristics and heuristics from the literature applied to the same problem instances, the quality of the proposed metaheuristics was validated. This confirmed the dissertation's basic hypothesis that task scheduling and load balancing in cloud computing can be further enhanced by utilizing swarm intelligence algorithms.
