Modern businesses grapple daily with the challenge of information and data overload, which complicates their operations and decision-making processes. It's crucial for these companies to effectively implement management knowledge to enhance their business activities. Increasingly, companies are focusing on safeguarding their organizational memory (company knowledge), its trade, and management. The adoption of management intelligence to handle organizational memory is becoming a vital part of successful business strategies. 

Despite its complexity, integrated automated organizational memory management, which merges knowledge management and information technology, is a solution. This approach simplifies the decision-making process within a company and streamlines the flow of documentation, information, and data. It also enables companies to obtain detailed data that eases business decision-making. 

However, protecting such an integrated automated process is essential. In line with international standards like ISO 27001, management in such systems should establish a model for implementing, handling, monitoring, reviewing, maintaining, and improving the security of the organization's memory management system. 

The security and protection of the organization's memory should be achieved through a cryptographic solution that balances user requirements, functionality within the organization's memory, and the need to safeguard sensitive data while maintaining their integrity. 

This integrated automated process could be useful in intelligent learning systems and modern business decision-making systems. Digital signing, in compliance with current legal regulations for electronic documents, would guarantee the authenticity and immutability of documents. 

This paper will propose a method to protect the integrated system for organizational memory management by encrypting them. This ensures that data is only accessible via the company's information system. It will also present a unique cryptographic solution for memory protection from a knowledge management perspective. 

Access to documents and data would be granted only to system users with explicit authorization through the permission management system. The paper will discuss principles and models that ensure data protection and privileged data access, all aimed at facilitating decision-making based on the organization's memory. Security information agencies serve as prime examples for such an analysis, with numerous instances of both successful organizations and oversights in their operations.
