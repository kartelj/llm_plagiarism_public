The W3C has suggested XML as a standard for use in web applications, transactions, documentation, database management systems, and for exchanging information over the internet. XML allows for the storage of various data, irrespective of its display method. It has been utilized to create, update, and query databases. The creation and writing of clear, human-readable and machine-readable XML documents is simple, making it easy to develop applications that process these documents. Essentially, any type of information can be expressed as XML documents. 

In recent times, there has been a significant increase in the amount of Arabic content and users on the internet. Arabic is a language spoken by over 375 million people, with more than 155 million, or over forty percent, of these Arabic speakers using the internet. This accounts for nearly five percent of all internet users globally. The number of Arabic-speaking internet users has increased sixty-fold in the last fifteen years (2000-2015). This surge in usage has surpassed the growth in information retrieval systems, Arabic text summarization (such as documents and web pages), query processes, and natural language processors. 

Arabic words have various syntax and morphology forms with different meanings. Documents often contain different word forms, including derivations, which can cause issues in text processing, document summarization, and information retrieval systems. Additionally, there is a significant loss of information during the querying, document summarizing, and information retrieval processes, especially with larger documents, as information loss is directly proportional to document size during these processes. 

This thesis outlines an RAX System designed to rank Arabic documents in information retrieval processes. The proposed solution primarily relies on the similarity of textual content. The model we've designed can be used for documents stored in various formats and written in Arabic. Due to the complex linguistic semantics of Arabic, the proposed solution employs a purely statistical approach. The design and implementation are based on existing text processing frameworks and Arabic grammar references. 

Our research has primarily focused on evaluating different similarity measures used for classifying Arabic documents from various domains and document categories based on user-provided query criteria. Additionally, the thesis will examine the security issues of the RAX system. These issues include XML security (XML digital signature and XML encryption) and the SOAP message to establish a secure environment between an end user and the RAX system model, as well as studying security attacks and countermeasures.
