This doctoral thesis introduces a new fingerprint biometric cryptosystem, utilizing the fuzzy commitment scheme and deep convolutional neural networks. The paper's primary innovation is a unique method for automatically discretizing fingerprint texture descriptors, entirely reliant on a convolutional neural network, and designed to create fixed-length templates. The proposed two-bit coding quantization of the extracted features converts biometric templates into a binary domain. This conversion enables the use of XOR biometrics and the creation of a biometric cryptosystem, suitable for key-release or as a safeguard for fingerprint matching systems. The issue of biometric data variability is minimized through the application of secure block-level Bose–Chaudhuri–Hocquenghem error correction codes, which are resistant to statistical-based attacks. The suggested biometric cryptosystem can handle a key length of 265 bits, satisfying the demands of contemporary cryptographic systems, with an acceptable EER of 1%. The evaluation reveals substantial performance improvements compared to other texture-based fingerprint matching and biometric cryptosystems.
