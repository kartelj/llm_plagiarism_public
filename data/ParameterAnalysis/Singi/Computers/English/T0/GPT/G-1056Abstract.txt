The future of information security is projected to undergo a significant and fundamental shift, moving towards a new theoretical computer security paradigm. This shift will enable the creation of a range of protection mechanisms that are not reliant on the computational power of potential attackers. This thesis is predicated on the development of new digital signal processing methods that can provide sufficient information at the physical layer of modern communication networks. The use of purely random extraction can aid in the development of new protocols and encryption key exchanges, maximizing length and imprecision. Biometrics is becoming a crucial source of parameters for reliable and acceptable authentication practices in cryptology. The digital signal processing of biometric data is vital for creating and extracting maximum entropy authentication codes. In terms of digital content copyright management, both visible and invisible digital seals are essential. All these factors contribute to a new position for this discipline in the theory and practice of comprehensive information protection systems. This thesis identifies, analyzes, and develops a class of digital signal processing subsystems to meet the new demands arising from these developments in information protection in modern computer and communication systems. The primary focus is on developing a class of encryption key systems based on iris biometrics.
