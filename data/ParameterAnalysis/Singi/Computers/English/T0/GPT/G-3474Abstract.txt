During the rapid advancement of information technologies, their application in the education process has significantly increased. Numerous educational institutions have adopted the DLS education platform, often as an addition to traditional education methods. However, there is a growing trend among higher education institutions globally, including our own country, to implement this form of training and organize distance learning. This paper aims to showcase the current status of high-quality DLS e-learning systems. It explores the evolution of e-learning models and proposes potential future directions. The incorporation of learning management systems, intelligent tutoring systems, and adaptive educational hypermedia systems in education has facilitated the creation of a vast repository of information about student learning patterns. Learning Management Systems (LMS) are utilized to create, organize, execute, and manage online courses and training programs, irrespective of their specific location and timing. Moodle (Modular Object Dynamic Learning Environment), an open-source system based on a set of PHP modules installed on the Web server and MySQL, Postgres databases, is one of the most prevalent learning management systems. The focus was on enhancing student performance in exams and the technical aspects of the e-learning system that could ensure its sustainable development amidst the rapid changes in the development and implementation of information and communication technologies.
