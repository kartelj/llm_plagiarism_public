The intricacy of the adaptive e-education process has resulted in a limited number of studies examining its methodological and integrated system development aspects. Therefore, the information provided in this paper is of particular importance and contributes significantly to the field. E-education is a multifaceted system encompassing distance learning and teaching, diverse teaching materials, individual and group learning, tutoring, and interactive work. To enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of e-education systems, it's crucial to consider students' preferences and learning styles. Various data sources, including business information systems, distance education systems, surveys, and teacher assessments, are used to identify these preferences. These data are then used to adapt the system, a process that modifies the system based on the student's knowledge. The primary objectives of adapting an e-education system include improving course design and utility, increasing student loyalty, assisting in course information retrieval, and advanced search and storage of search results in line with students' interests. This dissertation posits and validates the hypothesis that incorporating an adaptive model into the LMS system in e-education can enhance the educational process, elevate the quality of business processes in e-education, and justify its induction cost. The application of the developed adaptive model can address remote education challenges such as tailoring teaching material to students' needs, implementing a quality reporting system based on LMS data, and establishing an e-learning portal, among others. This results in increased student enrollment and graduation rates, reduced costs, improved fund utilization, and better decision-making. This doctoral dissertation delves into the application of adaptive methods and techniques in e-education, aiming to construct an adaptive model for the subject Programming for Internet. The experimental component was executed as an adaptive e-course for JAVA programming at the Informatics laboratory of the Professional Studies College of Technology in Sabac, Serbia. Standard statistical methods were used to measure relevant parameters and analyze the results. The findings indicate that students who participated in the adapted course achieved superior results compared to those in the non-adapted course.
