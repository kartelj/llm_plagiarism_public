We are observing how mobile devices have become an integral part of our daily lives, largely due to social media and the rapid flow of news. However, just a decade ago, mobile apps were created solely for specific purposes and their operational capabilities were significantly inferior to what we have today. This evolution of mobile devices has spurred the growth of scientific fields like telecommunications, electronics, software engineering, and internet technology, which may not seem directly related but have synergized through the development of mobile devices and their applications. 

The rapid advancements in these fields have allowed mobile devices to match the functionality of traditional PCs and continue to evolve. However, the autonomy and energy independence of these devices remain a challenge due to current battery technology. The market demands faster processors, thinner devices, larger screens, and crucially, mobile internet functionality. 

Manufacturers aim to maintain these features while improving energy efficiency and autonomy. This can be achieved through hardware and software innovations. Internet usage is a major power drain, making it a prime area for optimization. 

Most mobile apps operate on a master-slave communication principle with servers, exchanging large amounts of data. Whether it's reading messages, checking weather forecasts, using social media, or playing online games, the apps send and receive complex data structures. In the current era of object-oriented programming languages, this data can be treated as lists and series of class instances or objects. The process of packing and unpacking these complex data structures into a byte series suitable for transmission is known as data serialization. 

This paper presents research into energy-efficient data serialization between servers and mobile devices. The authors created a test environment to measure electricity consumption during server communication. The results were used to develop a mathematical model with functions representing the time required for serialization and the size of a serialized file. 

The data collected was used to create an experimental API-CBSaver, which uses the mathematical models to choose the most efficient method of serialization and compression in real time. The results from the API-CBSaver test provide a direction for improving energy efficiency.
