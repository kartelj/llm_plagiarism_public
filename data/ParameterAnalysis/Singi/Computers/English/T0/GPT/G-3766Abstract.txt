The aim of this thesis was twofold: to evaluate the conditions of patients with neuro-motor diseases using healthcare sensor networks, and to determine whether tennis is a more effective rehabilitation method than standard reeducation processes. An additional objective was to highlight the increasing risks faced by these sensor networks, which is a crucial aspect to monitor. The thesis compares the recovery and progress of two patients of similar age, strength, and physique, one undergoing traditional rehabilitation and the other using tennis as a therapeutic sport. Furthermore, the progress of the entire group is compared to a control group. The thesis also examines the healthcare sensor networks, their security, and proper installation. The research findings confirm that patients who used tennis as a form of therapy improved more quickly and effectively, with stronger stroke power by the end of the study compared to those undergoing standard rehabilitation. Thus, the research was successful. The study also supported the hypothesis that as technology advances, security vulnerabilities in various networks are becoming increasingly prevalent.
