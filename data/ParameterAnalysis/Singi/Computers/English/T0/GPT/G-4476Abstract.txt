To ensure information security in the digital realm, it's crucial to establish cryptographic algorithms that offer robust data and communication protection, support high-speed communication, demand minimal processing resources, and have a compact implementation. These features suggest a category of sequential cryptographic algorithms, specifically the creation of pseudorandom generators with these characteristics. Given these prerequisites, this study aims to develop a reliable and efficient class of pseudorandom generators. A class of random processes based on variable permutations is identified, and its probabilistic and statistical properties are examined. This class of random processes serves as a reference model for defining a class of pseudorandom generators parameterized with two pseudorandom sequences. The properties of this class of pseudorandom generators are analyzed using probability theory, information theory, and number theory. Conditions are derived under which the output sequence of the pseudorandom generators has an asymptotically uniform distribution of output symbols. Correlation analysis reveals that the elements of the parameterizing sequences and the output sequence are asymptotically independent, resulting in the information carried by the output sequence about the generator's current internal state being asymptotically zero. When the parameterizing sequences are chosen correctly, the output sequence period becomes significantly longer than the parameterizing sequences' period. These characteristics are essential for cryptographic pseudorandom generators. The proposed construction's efficiency is achieved through its compactness and the selection of efficient pseudorandomly generated parameterizing sequences, such as those generated by multiple linear shift registers. The potential applications of this class of reliable pseudorandom generators are also discussed.
