This thesis explores the performance analysis of wireless transmission over α-k-µ-g and k-µ-g fading channels. It includes the derivation of closed-form expressions for the probability density function (PDF) and cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for such a channel. The study also examines standard performance measures of the received signal, such as outage probability (OP) and level crossing rate (LCR), in relation to various system parameters. The thesis further investigates the enhancement of these performance measures when space diversity is employed at reception. It considers several space diversity techniques, specifically selection combining (SC) and maximal-ratio combining (MRC), to highlight how the impact of fading can be minimized. The thesis also analyzes the simultaneous occurrence of multipath fading and shadowing, and considers the use of macro-diversity reception combining along with micro-diversity combining to mitigate these detrimental effects and enhance reception signal quality. The results of the thesis demonstrate that the proposed approach effectively reduces the harmful effects of observed α-k-µ-g and k-µ-g fading in various wireless transmission scenarios.
