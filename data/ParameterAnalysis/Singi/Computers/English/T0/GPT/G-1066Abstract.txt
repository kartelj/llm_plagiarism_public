The interplay between supply and demand in the hotel industry is significantly influenced by the marketing strategies of hotel businesses. This paper focuses on Serbian hotels, which are characterized by a diverse range of facilities and services, setting them apart from each other and their international competitors. Recent investments in hotel infrastructure have transformed the image of 4 and 5 star hotels in Serbia, showcasing them in a contemporary, stylish setting equipped with modern amenities. This paper will examine the current status of 4 and 5 star hotels on the social media platform, Facebook, and assess the role and impact of Internet Distribution Systems (IDS) on sales and service quality. The paper will also highlight the changes in the Serbian hotel industry triggered by the advent of IDS. Two empirical studies were conducted, involving middle and senior management as well as guests of the hotels under study. The data gathered was processed using IBM SPSS Statistics 22 software, employing descriptive statistics, Student's t test, chi square test, Importance Performance Analysis, and Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). The study also utilized secondary data for promotional analysis, processed using Simply Measured tools.
