The doctoral dissertation titled "Posthuman Gaze: Automated Images in Contemporary Cinema" explores the use of automated images as a form of expression in modern cinema, viewed through the lens of new cinematic modes in the digital age. In a time where digital images are everywhere, the origin of these images is often unclear. They could be generated by our computer cameras, device lenses, or surveillance systems, and are typically produced automatically and algorithmically. The dissertation aims to investigate how these seemingly random and self-governing images influence modern cinema. The term "cinema" is thus viewed as an artistic medium with inherent transdisciplinarity. The primary objective of the dissertation is to analyze how post-cinematic culture, where film production and reception technologies are absorbed into drastically different power dynamics, mirrors the relationship between the human subject and his societal, neoliberal, technocentric environment, which is closely tied to the posthumanist context. The dissertation's introduction lays out the methodological groundwork, which includes theoretical and empirical research, a review and analysis of the theoretical framework, and an interdisciplinary approach to the subject. The first chapter provides the theoretical basis for the concept of automated image. The second chapter places the concept of automated image within the context of posthumanist studies, while the third chapter provides the terminological and structural groundwork for potential analysis of automated image as a film medium. The fourth, fifth, and sixth chapters delve into specific case studies, analyzing automated images in modern cinema through reviews of surveillance camera films, computer screen films, and landscape films, as emerging genres and filmmaking trends. These selected case studies suggest a common trend towards deconstructing traditional film narrative styles by using unconventional film techniques to align the content more closely with current screen culture, necessitating a new understanding of contemporary scopic regimes. As such, the dissertation provides a critical framework for understanding the trends of modern digital cinema within the context of posthumanist discourse.
