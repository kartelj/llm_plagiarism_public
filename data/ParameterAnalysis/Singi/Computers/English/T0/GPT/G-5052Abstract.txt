This thesis introduces a category of systems designed to create and distribute cryptographic keys, utilizing multiple biometric modalities. The theoretical structure involves two biometric modalities: fingerprints and irises. During operation, the system employs hash values derived from the initial, or enrollment, phase. Alongside these values, supplementary data is used to render biometric data revocable, thereby safeguarding the privacy of such data. This also offers protection for cryptographic parameters. Iris biometrics, which hold the most bio-information, are used to derive the secret key, while fingerprints are used for verification. The experimental analysis, covering the full scope of the thesis research, is based on samples from the CASIA biometric database. The experimental results demonstrate significant advancements that substantially enhance the performance of this category of systems.
