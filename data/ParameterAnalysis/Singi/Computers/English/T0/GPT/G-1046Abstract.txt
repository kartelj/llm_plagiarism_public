Modern electronic system users have faith in the high level of personal data and resource protection. This trust stems from the belief that the service provider has taken all necessary precautions to prevent failures. However, the complex system of protection and user administration can deter users from utilizing market-offered services. To ensure top-tier professional care, communication systems have developed their own attack-resistant protection systems. Yet, these professional systems must strike a balance between functionality and user protection. Their services are tailored to familiar infrastructure and typically safeguarded with the SSL/TLS protocol using known user data (username and password). This creates a balance between functionality and security, often overlooking safety rules and authentication based on user possession and identity. This paper explores the potential for implementing a solution that maintains system functionality while introducing safe authentication principles based on user possession. It provides an in-depth look at the development process and features of solutions guided by these principles, thereby enhancing the reliability of SSL/TLS authentication through multiple channels.
