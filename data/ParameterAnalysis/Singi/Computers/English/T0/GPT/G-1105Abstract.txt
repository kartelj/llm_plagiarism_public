The doctoral dissertation titled "Laser perception of defined objects, commands encapsulation and control elements for the modern robotized teaching tool" presents a practical framework for the creation of a modern robotized educational tool. This proposed system includes useful features such as laser recognition of defined objects on the robotized platform, multi-control modules, and experimental elements. The dissertation focuses on three main areas: the design and construction of the laser sensor group, the design and construction of a programmable control module and logic controllers, and the design and construction of a self-propelled robotized platform. These modules can function independently, but when combined, they form an excellent foundation for experimentation.
