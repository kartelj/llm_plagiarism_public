Swarm intelligence algorithms are widely used today to tackle a range of complex optimization problems. These algorithms share common elements such as the local search operator for exploitation around promising solutions, and the global search operator for exploration to avoid local optima. They are typically first tested on unconstrained, constrained, or high-dimensional sets of standard test functions. These algorithms can be enhanced, adapted, modified, hybridized, and combined with local search, with the ultimate goal of applying these metaheuristics to real-world optimization problems. 

The solution domains or search spaces for these challenging optimization problems can vary. Solutions may be vectors of real or integer numbers, or they could be more complex structures. Adapting swarm intelligence algorithms to different search spaces may involve simple adjustments of algorithm parameters or adaptation for integer solutions by rounding the obtained real solutions. However, for some search spaces, the algorithm may need to be almost entirely restructured, including the exploitation and exploration operators, while retaining only the guiding process or swarm intelligence. 

This dissertation presents several swarm intelligence algorithms and their adaptations for different search spaces and their application to practical problems. The dissertation aims to analyze and adapt swarm intelligence algorithms based on the fitness function and search space. It provides a thorough review of existing implementations of swarm intelligence algorithms, a comparative analysis, and a discussion of the strengths and weaknesses of some algorithms compared to others. It also explores the adaptation of swarm intelligence algorithms for different search spaces and their application to practical problems. 

The dissertation considers problems with real solutions such as support vector machine optimization and clustering, integer solutions like digital image segmentation problems, and problems where solutions have a unique structure like robot path planning and minimum weight triangulation. The modified and adapted swarm intelligence algorithms for different search spaces were tested on standard test data sets and compared with other contemporary methods from the literature for solving the considered problems. The adapted algorithms outperformed the methods from the literature in all cases, demonstrating the potential of adapting swarm intelligence algorithms for various search spaces, including complex structures.
