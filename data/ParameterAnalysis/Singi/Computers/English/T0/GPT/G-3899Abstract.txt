The doctoral thesis focuses on contemporary issues concerning cryptographic key exchange and user authentication in a confidential communication system. The study examines existing solutions in the research field and the development of a proprietary secret communication system. The dissertation's scientific objective is to enhance the protocol for cryptographic key exchange using electronic identification (eID). The existing research approaches were analyzed to bolster the protection level during confidential communication and lay the groundwork for a proprietary system. By integrating cryptographic methods that guarantee confidentiality, authenticity, and integrity, along with steganographic methods for covert information exchange, the proposed system allows users to exchange secret messages securely and efficiently. The research analysis concluded that it is reasonable to use secret exchanges of cryptographic keys in electronic communication identification.
