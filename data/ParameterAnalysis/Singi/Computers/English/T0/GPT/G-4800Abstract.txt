The Internet of Things (IoT) and blockchain are currently viewed as the two primary technologies. The enhancement of system connectivity and reduction of delays have increased the flexibility of using applications on remote devices. However, the IoT faces several challenges, including inadequate computing resources, insufficient memory, weak processors optimized for low energy consumption, poor interoperability, security vulnerabilities, privacy issues, and a lack of standards. These issues hinder the use of robust encryption algorithms.

This paper suggests the implementation of a software interface as a security gateway architecture for smart devices. This interface enables the use of more robust cryptographic algorithms for remote servicing of smart devices, thereby improving the security of data transmitted by these devices. The data is encrypted using compatible algorithms before being sent to remote services.

In addition to the interface, this paper also incorporates blockchain technology. The rationale behind this is to introduce decentralization and authentication into the network of connected smart devices. The integration of blockchain provides the much-needed anonymity and flexibility that the current IoT lacks. Blockchain safeguards the interface with its single point control technologies, records and validates all transactions, thereby fostering trust among devices on a single network.

The outcome of this research is the creation of an interface that enables smart devices to use any cryptographic algorithm, offers the capability to map IP addresses, and consequently prevents unauthorized network access. Alongside the interface development, blockchain technology will be incorporated in a compatible mode to ensure efficient operation on smart devices, considering resource constraints.
