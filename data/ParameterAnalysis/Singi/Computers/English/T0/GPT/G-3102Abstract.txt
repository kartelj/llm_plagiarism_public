Cloud computing security is a multifaceted issue that intersects with various fields such as computer network security, computer security, information security, and legal regulation implementation, among others. Despite its numerous benefits, the complexity of security in cloud computing has hindered its widespread use. One of the most secure methods of data preservation in the cloud is through cryptographic methods. However, storing data in the cloud as ciphertext presents a challenge as it cannot be processed within the cloud without decryption, posing a security risk. Homomorphic cryptosystems offer a potential solution, allowing data processing in encrypted form, with the results also encrypted and only decryptable by key holders. This is considered by some as the pinnacle of cryptography. 

Recently, the academic community has been focusing on improving encryption methods that allow ciphertext processing in the cloud. We have observed that the relationship between the encryption method used in the cloud and systems with limited computing resources is underexplored, despite its significant potential for everyday application. In this dissertation, we explore how homomorphic encryption can be safely used to leverage cloud applications. 

The dissertation begins with an introduction outlining the motivations for the research, the hypotheses, methods, research plan, and expected contributions. The second chapter delves into cloud computing, its historical development, and definitions. The third chapter explains the concept of homomorphism in cipher systems using mathematical tools. The fourth chapter discusses enhancing encryption key security using a virtual file system, with a focus on the storage and application of encryption keys. We propose storing encryption keys on Smart Card devices, a solution implemented in Unix/Linux operating systems and practically applied in the study. 

The fifth chapter highlights the dissertation's key scientific contributions, detailing the observed problem, problem modeling, and a proposed experiment. The implementation of the proposed solutions on two different platforms, the industrial computer Raspberry Pi and Android mobile phones, is described. The constraints regarding the length of the applied keys, the number of monitored sensors, and the length results found corrective function of the proposed model are also discussed. The dissertation concludes with a summary of the main scientific contributions and suggestions for future research in this area.
