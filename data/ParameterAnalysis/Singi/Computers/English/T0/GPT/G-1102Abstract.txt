The best results in design, development, and ICT security practice are achieved through the use of systems and processes approaches, as well as structural and object-oriented modeling. These security processes convert inputs into outputs, enhancing the value of the output parameters. They also combine procedures, tools, and skilled, motivated individuals to carry out security tasks. It's crucial to regularly assess and enhance these security processes, as most owners, managers, and users lack advanced security awareness, and security technologies and experts can be costly. 

Standards and models based on the Capability Maturity Model (CMM), particularly the System Security Engineering Capability Maturity Model (SSE CMM), have been created to assess quality and track the progress of process maturity and improvement. Comparative analyses of the correlation between standards and models, based on system, process, or environment approaches, suggest numerous opportunities to create a more comprehensive framework for process evaluation and improvement. 

CMMs that incorporate processes, such as SSE CMM and CMMI, offer a unified framework for evaluating and enhancing various processes. The SSE CMM includes SSE (11), project management (5), and organizational (6) process areas. In the SSE CMM, the quality and maturity of process performance are measured using a specific system and process-oriented metric, based on the performance and implementation of basic (BP) and generic (GP) practices. The SSE CMM metric categorizes capability (CL) and maturity (ML) levels into five active levels. 

The System Security Appraisal Method (SSAM), based on the SSE CMM model, is designed specifically to perform a verification type of evaluation that not only uncovers but also verifies objective data of the BP and GP practices performance and implementation. Experimental evaluation of the current ESS processes on three evaluated projects, along with a proposed process improvement action plan, confirms the declared user acceptability and applicability of the SSE CMM model and the SSAM method for evaluating and improving security processes. This leads to optimal security program development, security organization profiling, and numerous other ICT security applications.
