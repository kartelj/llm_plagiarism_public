This doctoral thesis explores a technically effective and socially applicable solution to guarantee the identity of each newborn baby. The importance of this issue has significantly increased due to past suspicions of baby swapping or theft in Serbian birthplaces. Numerous lawsuits, particularly those from the International Court of Law in Strasbourg, France, have also highlighted this problem. The proposed solution involves an authentic distributive information system and a unique patented device for biometric identification of parenthood based on fingerprint minutiae. The information system and device synergistically enhance the efficiency of the proposed solution, guaranteeing the identity of each newborn baby with 100% accuracy in real-time and providing proof of parenthood. Special attention has been given to the security aspects of the system due to the sensitivity of the data involved. Standalone algorithms have been developed for data acquisition and identity verification of both mother and baby at birth and upon leaving the birthplace, as well as procedures and timing for these actions. Cancelable biometrics are used to ensure total data safety and prevent any form of security compromise. The implementation of this system will significantly improve the quality of the healthcare system in the Republic of Serbia, benefiting institutions such as birthplaces and hospitals, and enhancing the quality of service for its citizens. It will eliminate the possibility of human error entirely and streamline numerous procedures in the existing system for baby birth across the Republic of Serbia. This doctoral thesis will present a system that prevents any potential identity changes, replacements, or theft of babies, thereby improving the speed and quality of service and ensuring that babies are 100% theirs in real-time conditions.
