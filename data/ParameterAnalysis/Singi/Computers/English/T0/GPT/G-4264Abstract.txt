This thesis's research aimed to outline the algorithms and software frameworks for adaptive systems applicable in traffic regulation at light-controlled intersections. A model was developed for determining the signal plan for a four-way intersection, regulated by traffic lights, with two or more stages where traffic can occur under unsaturated (non-congested) and saturated (congested) traffic conditions. A detailed analysis and functionality testing of the proposed adaptive systems for traffic regulation were carried out, particularly in scenarios involving emergency vehicles passing through the intersection or when such vehicles are in the dilemma zone.
