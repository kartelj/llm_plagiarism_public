In the early 21st century, Information Technology (IT) became an essential component of education. However, the period was marked by challenges in acquiring necessary equipment and integrating IT into contemporary education. Many developing countries underutilized the potential of this technology due to inadequate technical equipment in schools and lack of teacher training for its use. Most schools relied on proprietary software from IT companies, which was often expensive. This study aims to introduce a fresh research perspective in the realm of information systems and education, focusing on the potential and influence of Open Source Software (OSS). This subject is of significant interest in professional circles, especially after Munich's decision to transition to OSS to save substantial funds. Now, several EU countries are contemplating a similar switch, with some already taking initial steps. This issue warrants examination from various angles, including economic, technological, pedagogical, sociological, cultural, and legal perspectives. This paper presents a comparison between Microsoft Windows and Linux operating systems, a hot topic in the IT world regarding their applicability and superiority. It also examines the technological rivalry between Open Source and proprietary software code, considering their origins and development philosophies. To demonstrate the compatibility of these systems with the same hardware as their competitors, we conducted tests that confirm the feasibility of both systems on identical hardware architectures.
