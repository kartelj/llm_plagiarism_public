Given that Earth's population is over 7 billion and projected to reach 9 billion by 2050, identifying individuals while maintaining their privacy is a significant challenge. Biometric identification has become a primary requirement for many governments and security agencies in the interest of collective security. Private companies are also investing in this technology, tapping into a lucrative market previously exclusive to the government sector. Despite economic issues, the United States, as a technologically advanced nation, invests heavily in biometric identification, particularly after the 9/11 terrorist attacks. China, with its booming economy and large population, is also making strides in this field. India's motivation for biometric identification is unique, focusing on food distribution rather than security. The European Union, led by the Netherlands, is also investing in this technology. The privacy of biometric data largely depends on the policies of the organizations collecting and storing it, and the methods used to protect it. Even with trusted state institutions, misuse is a constant risk. Balancing security and privacy is a global research focus. Various approaches have been proposed over the years, with the advancement of information technology providing new opportunities. Biometric data is inherently "noisy", meaning it doesn't always present consistently. This makes traditional logic and cryptographic procedures unsuitable. Fuzzy Logic offers a new approach, closely resembling human thought processes. Some proposed solutions involve extracting cryptographic keys directly from biometric data using fuzzy extractor functions, which account for the uncertainty of biometric measurements. Other solutions propose creating a separate cryptographic key and combining it with the biometric data. These solutions often use error-correcting methods to compensate for the fuzziness of biometric data. The main disadvantage of solutions using fuzzy sketches is the exposure of biometric features during the decoding process. Solutions that independently create a cryptographic key and combine it with biometric data yield better results. Some suggest that the use of sequential error-correcting methods can yield good results. The solution proposed in this paper involves creating two independent templates from fingerprint data. The first template is used for identification, while the second combines biometrics with a pre-built cryptographic key. Both templates are stored on a token such as a microprocessor card. The proposed solution reduces errors in identification and cryptographic key reconstruction, making it efficient and practical. It also enhances the security of the original fingerprint image, which is never exposed in its raw form. This solution is resistant to a wide range of potential attacks aimed at compromising biometric data and personal identity.
