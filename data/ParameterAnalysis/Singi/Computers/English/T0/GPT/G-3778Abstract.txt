The primary objective of this study is to develop a comprehensive model of semiotics/axiology that focuses on discernment, interpretation, and reasoning. This model will be applied specifically to visual objects, phenomena, and media, which are often seen as value carriers. The study will also examine practices that generate or encode values. However, the research will not cover every individual visual subject or linguistic expression related to values across various human interests. Instead, it will propose a general strategy and method for reasoning about the conditions and reasons for creating different values. It will also suggest a method for organizing and classifying interpretations, reasoning, perceptions, and evaluations of sensory phenomena, particularly visual ones. 

In addition to a brief history of semiotic considerations, the resulting theory will offer a fresh interpretation and technical expressions of semiotics/axiology and the critical theory of signs/symbols. It will then demonstrate their application in interpreting and evaluating four aspects (aesthetic, functional, moral-ethical, cognitive) of sensory phenomena, with a special emphasis on the visual field of human sensitivity. The research will also focus on the visual appearance of phenomena, the construction of artificial phenomena, and sign/symbolic coding and decoding in visual arts, design, and communication design, using historical examples. 

The specific aim of the study is to show the dynamics of semiotic differentiation, interpretation, and evaluation of phenomena. This process is inherently tied to and limited by anthropocentric dualities, such as subject/object, real/unreal, true/false, suitable/unsuitable, pleasant/unpleasant, functional/dysfunctional, etc. The research will examine these value polarities during five historical phases: the Western Renaissance, pre-industrial, industrial, information, and post-information periods. It will also demonstrate how these culturally and semantically defined polarities tend to equalize over time through revolutions, turns, and hierarchical reversals, while maintaining the structural integrity of duality. This will be achieved by analyzing historical events, examples, and milestones that have contributed to semantic changes in polarity within the context of creativity, innovation, increased production, reproductive efficiency, and value distribution.
