The generation of high-quality random number series is a critical and sensitive aspect of any cryptographic system, necessitating a meticulous and thorough approach to the design and verification of generator characteristics. The quality of sequences produced by random value generators, particularly those based on sound cards, is significantly influenced by the randomness source's height of entropy and the post-processing procedure employed. This post-processing procedure distills the digitized form of a random analog signal, resulting in a uniformly distributed set of genuinely random numbers.

This dissertation focuses on the analysis of existing random sequence generators based on sound cards and introduces a new class of such generators. Random number sequences are essential in various fields, including cryptography, simulation, gambling, sampling, decision-making, medicine, aesthetics, and art. The most commonly used random value generator is the pseudorandom number generator (PRNG), a mathematical algorithm that produces a deterministic, periodic array of numerical values determined by the initial state, known as SID.

In contrast, true random number generators (TRNGs) are based on non-deterministic natural phenomena such as sound noise, radioactive decay, semiconductor-generated thermal noise, resistor thermal noise, photoelectric effects, and various quantum phenomena. Their output is non-periodic true random numbers. Numerous studies have been conducted to optimize the generation of random numbers using sound cards, with most approaches based on the requirements or structures of PRNGs.

This dissertation presents a method for generating true random bits using a computer's sound card, which is stimulated by environmental random signal noise, and a new post-processing (distillation) procedure involving the mixing of the input string and XOR-ing neighboring bits (Mibis & XOR). This post-processing method effectively separates and removes correlated adjacent bits from the input string, then XORs neighboring bits in the new set, reducing autocorrelation, increasing entropy, and reducing output bit set bias. Statistical randomness tests have shown that this class of generators produces high-quality random numbers quickly and efficiently.

The first part of the dissertation (Chapters 2 and 3) provides the theoretical foundation necessary to understand the original contributions presented in the second part. Chapter 2 introduces concepts of random processes, random signals, and stochastic signal sources, which are essential for generating true random number series. Chapter 3 covers the basics of sound cards and environmental noise signals.

The second part of the dissertation (Chapters 4 and 5) presents the original research findings. Chapter 4 discusses the results achieved in developing new methods for generating random sequences and the basic characteristics of true random number generators. It also details various post-processing techniques, their effectiveness, advantages, and disadvantages. Chapter 5 presents the results of applying the new distillation techniques.

The dissertation emphasizes the importance and development of new methods for generating true random sequences to create fast, efficient, and affordable random number generators accessible to a broad audience. It also highlights the development of new effective methods for generating random sequences using the hardware potential of personal desktop systems and new types of laptops, tablets, and smartphone devices. The system presented is efficient as it allows for the rapid generation of random values with sufficient unpredictability, making it suitable for various applications, even beyond cryptographic purposes. The results contribute to the development of hardware and software-environment basis for further improvements in random sequence generators.
