The Distance Learning System (DLS) is a contemporary educational concept that is quickly gaining global acceptance. The DLS is based on various tutoring systems and modules, such as assistant and tutor modules, modules for tracking and recognizing emotions, motivational modules, etc. These modules work in conjunction with feedback from the system. The modular nature of the DLS is crucial for its corrective roles, adaptability, automation process, and self-adaptation. 

This innovative DLS concept has facilitated the easy introduction, widespread presence, and enhanced functionality of modern Learning Management Systems (LMS). LMS are used for creating, organizing, implementing, administering, and verifying classes in relation to educational environments. 

Defining educational environments and preparing for classes begins with identifying the qualities of students, grouping them based on their predispositions, prior knowledge, and orientation. It's essential to understand the characteristics, tendencies, and abilities of each student. 

During classes, especially when faced with challenging mathematical tasks, misunderstandings and confusion may arise, leading to a range of emotions, distraction, and drops in concentration and motivation. At this point, the DLS and its modules signal any irregularities and a decline in study quality that no longer meets the individual needs of each student. The corrective functions module should address this issue. 

Therefore, it's crucial to identify student characteristics and valid educational environment factors from the start. Each student or group of students should be assigned an appropriate combination of DLS modules to successfully follow the classes and provide a quality assessment at the end of the course. 

All these different factors defining educational environments must be specified with weighting coefficients due to their consequential effects. It's essential to construct mathematical modules based on two types of information to provide a suitable grade for each student in the distance learning program. The first type of information considers the grade point average, grades from similar subjects obtained during the previous educational stage, the student's level of motivation, etc. The second type of information is based on the emotional reactions students display when faced with tasks and assignments. 

In addition to this, it's necessary to create mathematical models that include multi-criteria grading of certain DLS study platforms, all with the aim of correlating specific situations with the teaching process for the benefit of each individual student or groups of students. Sometimes, due to the structure of the method itself, it's not possible to simply use this multi-criteria grading method. Therefore, to achieve the best possible results, a specific grading method is created for each unique educational environment.
