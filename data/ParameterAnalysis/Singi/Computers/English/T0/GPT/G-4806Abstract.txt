Studies indicate that end users have primarily shifted their focus from social networking to communication platforms such as Viber, WhatsApp, FB messenger, Instagram, etc. The introduction of artificial intelligence and the concept of digital transformation play a significant role in modernizing businesses across various industries. Amid the fight against COVID-19 and the pursuit of innovative solutions that offer added value, chatbots have been introduced into the digital realm. These are software programs that mimic human conversation, assisting users in obtaining accurate information and simplifying everyday services. Over the past decade, the significant advancement of communication platforms and networking technologies has opened up new technical possibilities for the implementation of chatbots in diverse sectors, including e-commerce, customer support, marketing, and education. 

Chatbots are software programs that simulate conversation using artificial intelligence and engage in dialogue with humans using natural language understanding through text and voice messages. They utilize artificial intelligence to find answers and address user queries. In line with emerging trends, a methodological framework for developing modern chatbot architecture based on artificial intelligence for the next generation of internet users has been established. The main challenge in developing this adaptive platform is addressing the issue of integration flexibility and defining the mechanism for chatbot independence from a single natural language understanding (NLU) service, ensuring adequate adaptability. 

The suggested methodology offers a general procedure and is the outcome of merging different methodological approaches. As per the defined methodology, the process of developing an adaptive chatbot based on NLU is split into two primary phases: project engineering and application engineering, each further divided into activities. This separation benefits the creation of an adaptable platform for generating chatbots. A scalable and extensible chatbot architecture that supports various services for natural language understanding and communication channels is also proposed. The paper outlines the logical and physical architecture of chatbots. Independence from the NLU service is guaranteed through suitable metamodels and their mapping rules. 

The thesis offers an independent framework to reduce reliance on suppliers that provide services for natural language understanding and communication channels. This approach ensures independence from any service for understanding natural language, preventing the solution from being tied to a single service. Instead, the proposed mechanism facilitates easy mapping and switching from one NLU service to another. 

The implementation of the proposed solution is illustrated through a case study of the Academic Digital Assistant (ADA), the first educational project in the Balkans that enhances communication, saves time, and delivers services more quickly and efficiently. ADA receives messages from various messaging communication platforms and performs several crucial tasks before sending a message to the NLU. The NLU analyzes the text using machine learning techniques, compares, and then generates intent and its entities. The generated result is sent back to the chatbot platform, which uses a specific algorithm of intent, entities, and context and sends a response to the user in the appropriate format to display the message. ADA is available 24/7 and provides answers to frequently asked questions from students and prospective students. ADA is familiar with over 250 scenarios regarding questions and services that students wish to be performed. These scenarios include exam registration, change of examiner, semester certification, information on teacher consultations, deadlines, academy ranking, lecture schedule, student rating, events, service availability, academic environment, date of lectures and exams, activities taking place within the academy, and other useful academic information.
