The dissertation focuses on the exploration of interoperability models in e-business systems, viewed from various angles and based on service-oriented software development. The research takes into account standards, interoperability frameworks, enterprise information systems architecture, ontologies-based semantic technologies, and service orientation. By examining the current situation, best practices, and trends, the dissertation offers solutions to interoperability issues. This is achieved by introducing a methodological framework for ad-hoc connection of e-business systems, a universal meta model for ensuring semantic consistency of the system, and a model of service-oriented architecture for semantic interoperability of business processes on an ad-hoc basis. The research's validity was confirmed by improving interoperability and business process execution in the field of cultural heritage protection. The results have enhanced the utilization of available information, documents, and visual materials related to various cultural artifacts.
