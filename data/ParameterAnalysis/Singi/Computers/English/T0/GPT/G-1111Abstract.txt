The issue of stock-outs is a significant challenge in the retail industry, leading directly to lost sales, decreased profits, and potential customer loss. The stock-out rate is largely influenced by the business practices of retail chains and can vary significantly due to various factors, with the global average ranging between 5 - 10%. This high stock-out rate can result in an average financial loss of 4% of the total turnover of the retail chain. This study aimed to explore all relevant factors that could increase stock-outs in retail and the potential of automated ordering systems to address these challenges. The literature review covered organizational, operational, and technological aspects of the stock-out issue. A thorough investigation of the stock-out phenomenon and various automated ordering system concepts in retail set the stage for measuring the effectiveness of automated ordering systems. The study's primary goal was to determine the relationship between different stock-keeping units' (SKU) attributes and stock-out performance in retail business, and to assess the ability of automated ordering systems to handle the challenges associated with high-risk SKUs. The data sample was obtained from a large Serbian retailer and included two high-risk product categories, totaling 115 items and 97 stores, observed over one calendar year. A perpetual inventory aggregation method was used to identify stock-outs, while probit regression and t-test statistics were used to measure the impact of SKU attributes and the performance of the ordering system. The analysis of the stock-out rate, conducted before the main statistical analysis, identified patterns of stock-out variation, such as weekly fluctuations and differences in performance between SKUs and product categories. This could reveal potential causes of stock-outs and provide valuable input for further analysis. The study found that product availability in the distribution center, promotional activity, and sales speed negatively impact stock-out performance. However, the use of an automated ordering system was found to reduce the number of stock-outs. Despite this, the retailer-risk category was more sensitive to promotion and sales speed. The statistical analysis revealed that the automated ordering system performed significantly better than the manual one for cheaper items, promotional items, faster items, and items with significant sales variation. However, this was not proven for items with larger packaging. Interestingly, no significant performance improvement was recorded at the distribution center level for items ordered automatically compared to those ordered manually.
