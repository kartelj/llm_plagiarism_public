The relationship between supply and demand is largely dependent on the marketing activities of hotel companies. Hotels in Serbia, which are the subject of analysis in this paper, differ by a wide variety of facilities and services both among themselves and from competition in the global market. Investments in hotel capacities in the recent years have made an influence on 4 and 5 star hotels in Serbia today to present themselves in a whole new light with a modern style, elegant ambience and modern equipment. In this paper, we will analyze the current position of hotels categorized with 4 and 5 stars on the social network Facebook and determine the presence and importance of Internet distribution systems (IDS) in sales as well as their impact on the quality of hotel services. We will point out the changes that have occurred in the hotel industry due to the occurrence of IDS and the relationship between these systems and the hotel industry in Serbia.
