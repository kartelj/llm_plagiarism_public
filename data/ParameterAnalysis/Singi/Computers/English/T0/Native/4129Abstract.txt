This work proposes a novel approach to cryptographically secure biometric authentication based on cryptography with public keys, pseudo-random number generator and cancelable biometrics. The biometric templates are encrypted or cancelable during all the stages of the system’s use except the feature extraction stage, which makes the approach secure against a number of attacks. In addition, the system is not computationally demanding, and the size of biometric templates is acceptable. The proposed approach to cryptographically secure authentication is implemented through a modular biometric system for mobile banking user veriﬁcation, based on the human eye iris biometrics. Both the system performance and the randomness of the biometric templates and the data transferred over the network in this use scenario are positively evaluated on realistic data.
