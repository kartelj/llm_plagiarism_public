Users of modern electronic systems believe that the level for protection of personal data and resources is at a high level. Their trust is based on the assumption that the party providing the service has done everything that a failure does not occur. The complicated system of protection and user administration discouraged users from using services or services offered on the market. In order to achieve the highest level of professional care communication systems have developed their own systems of protection, resistant to all known types of attacks. However, professional systems are forced to balance between functionality and user protection. Their service are set to the familiar infrastructure and in most cases protected with the SSL / TLS protocol with the use of data that are known to user (username and password). In this way, there has been a balance between functionality and security, ignoring safety rules and authentication for something a user has and something the user is. This paper discusses the possibility of introducing its own solution that does not diminish the functionality of system, and introducing the principle of other rules of safe authentication, something the user has. This paper presents detailed process of development and characteristics of solutions provided by these principles and thus increases the reliability of SSL / TLS authentication with multiple channels.
