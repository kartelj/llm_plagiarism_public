In the period of accelerated development of information technologies, there was a great application in the education process. A large number of educational institutions use the DLS education platform, partly as a complement to traditional education. But there is an increasing number of higher education institutions both in the world and in our country that have implemented this type of training and have organized distance learning. The aim of the research in this paper was to present the current state of quality DLS e-learning systems. The evolution of e-learning model models has been explored and some future directions have been proposed. The use of learning management systems, intelligent tutoring systems, adaptive educational hypermedia systems in education has made it possible to create a large treasure trove of information about how students learn. Learning Management System (LMS) are used to create, organize, implement, administer online courses, training programs, regardless of their specific location and time of maintenance. Moodle (Modular Object Dynamic Learning Environment) is one of the most common learning management systems. This open-source system is based on a set of PHP modules that are installed on the Web server and MySQL, Postgres databases. The emphasis was placed on improving student performance in the examination process as well as on the technical aspects of the e-learning system that could ensure sustainable system development due to rapid changes in the development and implementation of information and communication technologies.
