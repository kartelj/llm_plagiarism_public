In this doctoral dissertation titled "Laser perception of defined objects, commands encapsulation and control elements for the modern robotized teaching tool" is offered a practical framework for the development of modern robotized educational tool. The projected set offers pallet utility elements such as the use of lasers in recognizing the robotized platform. objects defined, multi-control modules and experimental Dissertation is focused on three areas:  design and construction of the laser sensor group, design and construction of programmable accompanying control module, logic controllers and  design and construction of self-propelled robotized platform. All these modules can operate independently. Integrated into a whole (kit) they represent an excellent basis for the experiments.
