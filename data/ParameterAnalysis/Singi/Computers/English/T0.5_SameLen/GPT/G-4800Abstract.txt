Today's two primary technologies are the Internet of Things and blockchain. Enhancements in system connectivity and delay reduction have increased the flexibility of using applications on remote devices. However, the Internet of Things faces significant issues like insufficient computing resources, limited memory, and weak energy-efficient processors, which hinder the use of robust encryption algorithms. Other challenges include poor interoperability, security vulnerabilities, privacy concerns, and a lack of standards. This paper suggests employing a software interface as a security gateway architecture for smart devices. This security interface enables the use of more potent cryptographic algorithms for remotely servicing smart devices. This method improves the security of data sent by smart devices, utilizing compatible data encryption algorithms before forwarding to remote services. Besides the interface, this paper also employs blockchain technology. The rationale for using blockchain technology is to introduce decentralization and authentication into the network of connected smart devices. The blockchain's integration provides the much-needed anonymity and flexibility that the current Internet of Things lacks. Blockchain safeguards the interface with its single point control technologies, logs all transactions, validates them, and hence, establishes trust among devices on a single network. The outcome of this study is the creation of an interface that supports smart devices to employ any cryptographic algorithm, offers the capability to map IP addresses, and thus prevents unauthorized network access. In addition to the interface's development, blockchain technology will be integrated in a compatible mode, ensuring efficient operation on smart devices, considering resource limitations.
