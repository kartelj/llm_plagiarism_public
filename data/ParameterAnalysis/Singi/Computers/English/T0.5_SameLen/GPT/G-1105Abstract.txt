The doctoral thesis entitled "Laser perception of defined objects, commands encapsulation and control elements for the modern robotized teaching tool" presents a practical blueprint for creating a modern robotized educational tool. This proposed kit includes useful components like laser recognition of defined objects on the robotized platform, multi-control modules, and experimental dissertation. The dissertation focuses on three main areas: the design and construction of the laser sensor group, the creation of a programmable control module, and logic controllers, and the development of a self-propelled robotized platform. Each of these modules can function independently, but when combined into a complete kit, they provide an excellent foundation for experimentation.
