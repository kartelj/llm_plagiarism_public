Tourism that is inclusive, barrier-free, accessible, or access tourism are terms that refer to tourism tailored for all types of consumers. This concept, while relatively new and under-researched in our local market, is globally recognized for its potential and has been extensively studied and adapted to cater to clients who require these services. The challenge for the entire tourism industry lies in creating products and services in an environment suitable for all users. Adhering to global tourism trends and implementing various laws and regulations, or aligning them with EU legislation, ensures these customer categories enjoy equal participation in all societal activities, including leisure activities. It's crucial to integrate accessibility into every responsible and sustainable tourism policy and strategy, necessitating national-level investment in all sectors comprising the tourism industry. Being aware of and adapting regulations not only supports human rights but also presents a business opportunity. However, a change in mindset and service delivery model is vital. This paper focuses on hotel services designed to cater to the needs of accessible tourism users. An accessible environment and services enhance the quality of hotel products, thereby increasing the overall competitiveness of tourism destinations. The research results analysis reveals the management's attitude towards accessible tourism in Belgrade's accessible hotels. The paper analyzes their attitude towards accessible tourism consumers, the range of services tailored for them, HR policies, and the promotion intensity of accessible accommodation. The research aims to gauge management's attitude towards the impact of accessible tourism on their business success.
