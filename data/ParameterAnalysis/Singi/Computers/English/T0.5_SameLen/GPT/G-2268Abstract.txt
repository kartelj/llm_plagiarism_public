The requirement for enhanced data-rate of transmitted multimedia and the growing need for stringent copyright protection in today's world is becoming more evident. In this scenario, FSO communications serve as an excellent substitute to traditional wireless communication systems. These systems, when feasible, deliver extremely high performance to users, with data rate transfers reaching several Gb and essentially offering high security. Due to its cost-effective implementation, its application in the "last mile" connection is practical and significant. This paper investigates the feasibility of transmitting images via FSO communication channel in the presence of scintillation. It examines the transmission of copyright-protected data (watermarked images) and the effect of FSO channels on their degradation, degradation or protection code, as well as color images to detect fires in the image post transmission over FSO communication channel.
