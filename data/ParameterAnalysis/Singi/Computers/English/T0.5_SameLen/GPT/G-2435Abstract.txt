The W3C suggested XML as a standard for use in web applications, transactions, documentations, database management systems, and for exchanging information over the Internet. XML can store various types of data, irrespective of how it will be presented. It is used for creating, updating, and querying databases. It's simple to create and write intelligible, human-readable XML documents, as well as machine-readable ones, making it easy to generate applications that handle these XML documents. Essentially, all information can be expressed as XML documents. Recently, there's been a significant increase in Arabic content and user numbers on the Internet. Arabic is a language spoken by over 375 million people, with more than 155 million, or over forty percent of these Arabic-speaking individuals, using the Internet. This accounts for nearly five percent of all Internet users globally. The number of Arabic-speaking Internet users has multiplied sixty times in the past fifteen years (2000- 2015). This increase in usage has outpaced the development of information retrieval systems, Arabic text summarization (like documents and web pages), query processes, and natural language processors. Arabic words have varying syntax and morphologies with different meanings. Documents often contain different word forms, including derivations, which can complicate text processing, document summarization, and information retrieval systems. Moreover, there is significant information loss during querying, document summarizing, and information retrieval processes, especially with larger documents, as information loss is directly related to document size during these processes. This thesis outlines an RAX System designed to rank Arabic documents in information retrieval processes. The proposed solution primarily relies on textual content similarity. The model we've created can be applied to documents in various formats written in Arabic. Given the complex linguistic semantics of Arabic, the proposed solution utilizes a purely statistical approach. The design and implementation draw from existing text processing frameworks and reference Arabic grammar. Our research has primarily focused on evaluating different similarity measures used for classifying Arabic documents from various domains and document categories based on user-provided query criteria. Additionally, the thesis will examine the security aspects of the RAX system. These aspects include XML security (XML digital signature and XML encryption) and the SOAP message to establish a secure environment between an end user and the RAX system model, as well as exploring security attacks and countermeasures.
