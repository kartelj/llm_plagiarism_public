'This PhD dissertation explores a technologically efficient and socially applicable solution to ensuring the identity of every newborn baby. The relevance of this issue has significantly increased due to suspicions of infant swapping or theft in Serbian birthing facilities in the past. It's essential to acknowledge the numerous lawsuits, particularly those from the International Court of Law in Strasbourg, France, relating to this issue. The proposed solution includes an original distributed information system and a unique patented device for biometric parent identification based on fingerprint minutiae. The information system and device synergistically enhance the effectiveness of the entire proposed solution, providing real-time, 100% accurate identification of each newborn baby and proof of parentage. Special consideration was given to the system's security aspects, given the sensitivity of the data. Independent algorithms were developed for data collection and identity verification of both mother and baby at birth and upon departure from the birthing facility, along with procedures and timing. Cancelable biometrics are utilized to ensure complete protection from data compromise or security corruption. Implementing this system would significantly improve this aspect of Serbia's healthcare system, benefiting both institutions (birthing facilities, hospitals) and the quality of service for its citizens. It would eliminate the possibility of human error entirely and streamline a number of procedures following the specification of the existing system used in hospitals for baby births across Serbia. This PhD dissertation will present a system that prevents any potential identity changes, swaps or thefts of babies, leading to improvements in the speed and quality of service that assures babies are 100% theirs in real-time conditions.
