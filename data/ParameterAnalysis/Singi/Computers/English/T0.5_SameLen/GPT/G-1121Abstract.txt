This article focuses on investigating the retrieval of multimodal business documents in a desktop setting. A document imparts information through multiple modes, including text, layout/style, and visuals. For instance, scientific papers typically include figures to demonstrate experimental findings, and the headline in a scientific paper generally has a different font size than the main text. The conventional method of IR (Information Retrieval) uses only text for indexing and retrieval. However, with the growth of the Internet and Digital Libraries, it has become increasingly vital to develop IR methods for smart indexing and retrieval of multimodal documents. Indexing and retrieval constitute two crucial elements of an IR system. Given a set of documents, indexing characterizes documents using an index language. Retrieval employs the outcomes of indexing and identifies relevant documents in response to a user's query. Text and image modes employ different indexing and retrieval strategies. Single-modality IR, whether it uses text or visuals, has drawbacks. Multimodal IR seeks to address the shortcomings of each individual mode by merging them.
