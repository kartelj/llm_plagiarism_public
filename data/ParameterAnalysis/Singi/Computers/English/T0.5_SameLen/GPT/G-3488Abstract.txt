Continuous access to enhancing the quality of products, services, and software allows all organizations to respond flexibly to rapid changes typical of modern market economies. The competitive edge in the market is maintained through the ongoing enhancement of product, service, and software quality. Quality enhancement can only be realized by managing all process input elements that affect quality. In this dissertation, we will examine the concept of product as the "outcome of a specific process", which includes: 1) product; 2) service and 3) software. This dissertation will present the methodology of setting and assessing user requirements, and identifying process input elements - factors that affect the satisfaction of these needs. Numerous factors affect the quality and satisfaction of user requirements in the product realization process, which complicates product quality management. There are always numerous alternative solutions for enhancing product quality. Each improvement solution is marked by specific implementation costs and varying effects on product quality. When assessing alternative quality enhancement solutions, determining the implementation costs for each solution is straightforward. The main challenge is to ascertain the effect of enhancing a specific factor on product quality, and indirectly on user satisfaction. The issue is selecting the optimal (best) combination of factors affecting product quality under conditions of limited financial resources. What will be the impact of enhancing certain factors affecting product quality? To examine the effect of enhancing factors affecting product quality on the final product's compliance with user requirements, we will use the compliance of the final product simulation using the Markov process with the assistance of the Matlab programming language. This dissertation significantly contributes to enhancing the modeling methodology and managing factors that affect product quality. A crucial contribution of this dissertation is the social contribution and capacity to address practical issues in business systems related to process quality enhancement that affects the satisfaction of requirements. The research outcomes can guide decision-making regarding the direction to take to enhance product quality. Key words: quality, product quality, process input elements, factors affecting product quality, quality enhancement, Markov processes, simulation of quality enhancement effects.
