Mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) are self-organizing systems of nodes linked wirelessly, with no centralized control. These types of networks are presently a key area of research due to their wide range of applications (military, emergency, etc.). In MANETs, each node functions as both a host and a router, therefore, it must be able to forward packets to other nodes. The node mobility leads to frequent changes in these networks' topologies. To address these issues, specific routing protocols for MANETs are required. Traditional routing protocols used in wired networks are not efficient in MANETs. This thesis aims to investigate the current state of the art of existing routing protocols for MANETs, and compare various methods. There are three primary categories of routing protocols for MANETs: reactive, proactive, and hybrid. By examining the pros and cons of each, a new routing protocol is suggested. The new plan, named OLSR-BF, is a proactive routing protocol largely based on the existing OLSR routing protocol. The key change in the new routing protocol is primarily the use of the Bellman-Ford algorithm to determine the shortest distance between nodes within a MANET network. To confirm the design and performance of the new routing protocol, it is qualitatively compared with existing AODV, DSDV, and OLSR routing protocols.
