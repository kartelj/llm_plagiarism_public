Research in human-computer interaction utilizes an interdisciplinary approach, incorporating fields such as computer science, psychology, sociology, cognitive sciences, and design. Modern interfaces facilitate interaction through a variety of sensors, including mouse, keyboard, gaze monitor, EEG, pulse monitor, heart rate monitor, etc. This research focuses on human-computer interaction, specifically the application of artificial intelligence in analyzing and assessing cognitive performance of users. The speed of data analysis surpasses human capabilities, allowing real-time feedback, making the system an active participant in the interaction. The feasibility of developing an AI model to collect and analyze human-computer interaction data was demonstrated through four cognitive performance assessments using neuropsychological tests. Individual client applications were developed for each experiment, with the capability to connect to sensor applications via the HCI-MAP platform. Data was collected using three sensors: an EEG device, an eye tracker, and a computer mouse. Independent sensor applications were written to communicate with the EEG and eye tracker to allow for data aggregation and joint processing. Our research findings indicate a deviation from reference values in participants' performance on the computerized WCS test. Visual short-term memory (VSTM), the ability to retain small amounts of visual information for a brief period, was also examined. The EEG data was classified using four algorithms: Naive Bayes, Support Vector, KNN, and Random Forest. The results showed a high accuracy in classifying the order and type of images presented. The mTutor platform was used to explore the application of AI in electronic assessment of knowledge. Although no strong correlation was found between any individual parameter and response accuracy, it was found that the emotional state of the subjects could be influenced by the type of questions asked. The AC test was used to evaluate attention span, or the ability to distinguish important stimuli from distractions. A high correlation between gaze position and mouse cursor position was observed, providing an opportunity to approximate one sensor's interaction using data from another. The overarching conclusion is that AI can be used to analyze human-computer interaction, yielding results comparable or superior to human analysis. Distributed solutions can be implemented for synchronization and real-time system feedback. AI can effectively assess users' cognitive performance through automated analysis.
