The intricacy of the adaptive e-education process has resulted in limited research papers examining this field from both a methodological and integrated e-education system development perspective. As such, the content of this paper holds unique value and offers a significant contribution. E-education is a multifaceted system incorporating distance learning and teaching, diverse teaching materials, individual and group learning, tutoring, and interactive engagement. To enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of e-education systems, it is crucial to consider students' preferences and learning styles. The identification of student preferences utilizes data from business information systems, distance education systems, surveys, and teacher evaluations. System adaptation, which alters the system based on student knowledge, uses this data. The primary objectives achievable through e-education system adaptation include improved course design and utility, increased student loyalty, assistance in course information discovery, advanced searching, and saving search results in the context of student interests. This dissertation posits and proves the hypothesis that implementing an adaptive model in the LMS system of electronic education can improve the educational process, elevate the quality of e-education business processes, and justify its induction cost. Utilizing the developed adaptive model can address remote education challenges such as tailoring teaching material to student needs, implementing a quality reporting system based on learning management system data, creating an electronic learning portal, and more. This results in increased student enrollment and graduation, reduced costs, better fund utilization, and improved decision-making. This doctoral dissertation provides a detailed discussion on the application of adaptive methods and techniques in electronic education, aiming to construct an adaptive model for the subject Programming for Internet. The experimental component was executed as an adaptive electronic course for JAVA programming at the Informatics laboratory of the Professional Studies College of Technology in Sabac, Serbia. Standard statistical methods were used to measure relevant parameters and analyze results. The study findings reveal that students enrolled in the adapted course achieved superior results compared to those in the non-adapted course.
