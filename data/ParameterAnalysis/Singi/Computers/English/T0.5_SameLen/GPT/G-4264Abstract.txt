This thesis' research aimed to identify the algorithms and software frameworks for adaptive systems applicable in traffic regulation at light-controlled intersections. A model to calculate the signal plan for a four-way intersection, managed by traffic lights, with two or more stages allowing traffic under unsaturated (non-congested) and saturated (congested) traffic conditions, has been developed. A detailed analysis and functionality test were performed on the proposed adaptive systems for traffic regulation, especially during situations involving emergency vehicles passing through the intersection and when these vehicles are in the dilemma zone.
