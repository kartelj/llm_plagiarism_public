The interplay of supply and demand is mostly influenced by the marketing strategies of hotel businesses. This paper will analyze hotels in Serbia, which are characterized by a vast range of facilities and services, distinguishing them from each other and their international competitors. Recent investments in Serbian hotel infrastructure have transformed 4 and 5 star hotels, introducing modern designs, sophisticated ambiance, and state-of-the-art equipment. This paper will investigate the present status of 4 and 5 star hotels on the social media platform, Facebook, and assess the role and significance of Internet Distribution Systems (IDS) in sales, as well as their effect on service quality. The paper will highlight the transformations in the hotel industry instigated by IDS and the connection between these systems and Serbia's hotel sector. Two empirical studies were conducted, with respondents being middle and top-tier management and guests who have stayed in the hotels under study. The gathered data was examined using IBM SPSS Statistics 22 software, utilizing descriptive statistics, Student's t test, chi square test, Importance Performance Analysis, and Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). Secondary data for the promotional study was processed using Simply Measured tools.
