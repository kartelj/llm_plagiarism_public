The approaches of systems and processes, as well as structural and object-oriented modeling, yield optimal results in design, development, and ICT security practice. These system security processes convert inputs into outputs, enhancing the value of output parameters, and amalgamate procedures, tools, and proficient, motivated individuals to execute security practice tasks. Continuous evaluation and enhancement of security processes is necessary as owners, managers, and average users typically possess underdeveloped security awareness, and security technologies and experts can be costly. Process-oriented standards and models, such as CMM (Capability Maturity Model), particularly SSE CMM (System Security Engineering Capability Maturity Model), have been created to assess quality and track progress of process maturity and enhancement. Comparative analysis of the correlation between standards and models, based on system, process, or environment approaches, suggests numerous opportunities to establish a broader framework for process assessment and enhancement. The CMMs that amalgamate processes (SSE CMM, CMMI) offer a unified and unique framework to assess and enhance various processes. The SSE CMM incorporates SSE (11), project management (5), and organizational (6) process areas. In the SSE CMM, process performance quality and maturity are evaluated by a specific system and process-oriented metric, based on basic (BP) and generic (GP) practices performance and implementation standards. The SSE CMM metric categorizes the capability (CL) and maturity (ML) levels into 5 active levels. The SSAM (System Security Appraisal Method), based on the SSE CMM model, is specifically created to conduct verification type of evaluation that not only uncovers but verifies objective data of the BP and GP practices performance and implementation. Experimental assessment of the current ESS processes on three evaluated projects and processes enhancement action plan proposal confirm declared users' acceptance and applicability of the SSE CMM model and the SSAM method to the security processes assessment and enhancement for the optimal security program development, security organization profiling, and a number of other ICT security applications.
