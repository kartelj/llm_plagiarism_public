The dissertation's subject is the investigation of e-business systems' interoperability models, viewed from various angles, and based on service-oriented software development. The research examined: standards, interoperability frameworks and enterprise information systems architecture, semantic technologies reliant on ontologies, and service orientation. By assessing current conditions, best practices, and trends, the dissertation proposes solutions to interoperability issues by introducing: a methodological framework for ad-hoc connection of e-business systems, a universal meta model for ensuring semantic consistency of the system and for the description and discovery of e-business systems components; a service-oriented architecture model for semantic interoperability of business processes on an ad-hoc basis. The research's validity was confirmed by enhancing interoperability and business process execution in the field of cultural heritage protection. The results achieved have enhanced the utilization of existing information, documents, and visual material pertaining to various forms of cultural artifacts.
