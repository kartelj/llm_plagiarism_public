The cloud computing model, akin to the network computing model, relies on resource clustering and the implementation of network and internet technologies. Fundamentally, cloud computing signifies a novel method of providing computing resources as a service, encompassing data, software, and hardware components such as processing elements, memory, and storage. Cloud computing is a present and significant multidisciplinary field, with numerous papers published in top-tier international journals and presented at globally recognized international conferences. Based on the scientific findings from these papers, it is evident that many challenges and issues exist within the cloud environment that could be more effectively addressed using enhanced methods, techniques, and algorithms. A key challenge in cloud computing is scheduling end user requests on a restricted set of available resources, or virtual machines. A scheduling issue in a cloud environment can be described as a task execution schedule on a limited resource set, considering potential constraints and objective function. Task scheduling is achieved through scheduling algorithms, which can be static or dynamic. In static scheduling, where task switching from overused to underused virtual machines is not feasible, tasks are allocated for execution on available virtual machines prior to the scheduling algorithm execution. In the case of dynamic scheduling methods, also known as load balancing approaches, workload allocation between active virtual machines occurs during the scheduling algorithm runtime. Request redistribution is carried out by dynamically switching from overused to less used virtual machines. Heuristic and metaheuristic optimization methods are predominantly used for dynamic scheduling and have demonstrated excellent results. Task scheduling and load balancing issues in cloud computing are classified as NP hard combinatorial and/or global problems, with or without constraints. Based on published findings, it is clear that swarm intelligence metaheuristics have been successfully trialed on benchmark and practical NP hard optimization problems, outperforming other methods, techniques, and algorithms in terms of convergence speed and solution quality. In the experiments conducted for this doctoral thesis, the potential for further improvement of task scheduling and load balancing in cloud computing through the application of swarm intelligence metaheuristics is investigated. During the experimental research, several swarm intelligence metaheuristics were enhanced and adapted to tackle task scheduling and load balancing issues in the cloud environment. This dissertation presents the implementation of two enhanced swarm intelligence algorithms - the monarch butterfly optimization algorithm and the whale optimization algorithm. Two task scheduling models were examined. The first model is a single-objective optimization model, with the goal of minimizing the execution time of all tasks on the cloud. The second model is a multi-objective optimization model, aiming to minimize both the execution time of all tasks on the cloud and the total cost of utilized cloud resources. The simulations were conducted in a robust CloudSim simulator environment, and both algorithms were tested against a set of artificial data (generated within the CloudSim platform) and real data (obtained from a globally accessible benchmark database). In addition to testing swarm intelligence algorithms on practical cloud problems, to more accurately assess the improvements of the modified metaheuristics over the original versions, both enhanced algorithms were also validated by running simulations on standard benchmark sets for unconstrained global optimization. By comparing the results (solution quality and convergence rate) of the enhanced metaheuristics with the results of the best known metaheuristics and heuristics from the literature, applied to the same problem instances (for practical cloud scheduling problem and benchmark tests), the quality of the proposed metaheuristics was validated. This confirms the primary hypothesis of this dissertation, that task scheduling and load balancing in cloud computing can be further improved by using swarm intelligence algorithms.
