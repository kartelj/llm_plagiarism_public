This research aims to develop a comprehensive semiotics/axiology model for discernment-interpretation-reasoning, with a particular focus on its application to visual objects, phenomena, and media, which are often considered as value carriers or producers. However, this study will not address every individual visual subject or linguistic expression used across various human value interest areas. Instead, it will suggest a general approach for reasoning about the conditions and reasons for creating different values, as well as the utterances, numerous expressions, and words, both historical and contemporary. It will propose an organizational and classification method for distinguishing, interpreting, reasoning, perceiving, and evaluating sensory phenomena, particularly visual phenomena. Along with a brief history of semiotic considerations, the resulting theory will offer a fresh interpretation and technical expressions of semiotics/axiology, the critical theory of signs/symbols, explain them, define them, and then propose and demonstrate their application in the interpretation and evaluation of four aspects (aesthetic, functional, moral-ethical, cognitive) of sensory phenomena. The focus will be on the visual field of human sensitivity, the visual appearance of phenomena, processes, media, and media in the construction of artificial phenomena, as well as sign/symbolic coding and decoding in the practices of visual arts, design, and communication design, as shown by historical examples. The research's specific objective is to illustrate the dynamics of semiotic differentiation-interpretation-evaluation of phenomena that are inherently linked to and constrained by anthropocentrically generated dualities, primary polarities like: subject/object, real/unreal, true/false, suitable/unsuitable, pleasant/unpleasant, functional/dysfunctional, etc. This will be done by examining the structurally set value polarities embodied in technofacts during five historical phases: Western Renaissance, pre-industrial, industrial, information, and post-information periods. The research will demonstrate how these historically, culturally generated and semantically defined polarities tend to "equalize" through revolutions, turns, and hierarchical reversals, while also tending to reproduce, maintain the syntactic continuity and structural integrity of duality, that is to preserve the structurally primary polarity of the mathematical type +/-, by analyzing historical events, examples, and milestones that have contributed to the semantic changes in polarity within the context of creativity, innovation, historical increase in production, reproductive, multiplicative efficiency, and distribution of values.
