Producing high-quality random number sequences is a critical and delicate aspect of any cryptographic system, necessitating a meticulous and thoughtful approach to the design and verification of generator characteristics. The quality of sequences produced by random value generators based on the sound card is significantly influenced by the randomness source of entropy's height and the implemented post-processing procedure. This post-processing procedure facilitates the distillation of a digitized version of a random analog signal, yielding a collection of genuinely random numbers with a uniform distribution. 

This dissertation focuses on analyzing existing and introducing a new class of random sequence generators that utilize a sound card. Random number sequences are indispensable in a variety of fields, including cryptography, simulation, gambling, sampling, decision-making, medicine, aesthetics, and art. The most commonly used random value generator is the pseudorandom number generator (PRNG), a mathematical algorithm that produces a deterministic, periodic array of numerical values determined by the initial state known as SID. Unlike the PRNG, a true random number generator (TRNG) is based on non-deterministic natural phenomena such as sound noise, radioactive decay, semiconductor-generated thermal noise, resistor thermal noise, photoelectric effects, and various quantum phenomena, producing non-periodic true random numbers. 

To achieve the best possible random numbers on sound cards, numerous studies have been conducted, most of which have used approaches based on PRNGs' needs or structures. This dissertation introduces an approach to generate true random bits utilizing the computer hardware's sound card, which is influenced by random signal noise in the environment, and postprocessing (distillation) with a new process of mixing the input string and XOR-ing neighboring bits (Mibis & XOR). This post-processing method allows for the efficient separation and removal of correlated adjacent bits from the input string. Afterward, the XOR-ing of neighboring bits in the newly obtained set reduces autocorrelation, increases entropy, and decreases bias of the output bits set. 

Statistical randomness tests have shown that this class of generators exhibits excellent characteristics and can generate a large volume of high-quality true random numbers in a very short time. The first part of the dissertation (Chapters 2 and 3) presents the theoretical basis necessary for understanding the original contributions outlined in the second part. Chapter 2 introduces the concepts of random process, random signal, and stochastic signal sources as necessary factors in generating a true random number series. Chapter 3 provides an overview of sound cards and environmental noise signals. 

The second part of the dissertation (Chapters 4 and 5) presents the original research findings. Chapter 4 reveals the results achieved in developing new methods for generating random sequences and the basic characteristics of true random number generators. The working principle of true random number generators, their classification and characteristics, recent research, designs, and stages of operation are detailed. Various post-processing techniques, their effectiveness, pros and cons are also discussed. Chapter 5 presents the results of applying the new distillation techniques. 

The dissertation emphasizes the importance and development of new methods for generating true random sequences to produce fast, efficient, inexpensive, and therefore accessible random number generators for a broad audience. Special attention is given to developing new effective methods for generating random sequences using the hardware potential of personal desktop systems and new types of laptops, tablets, and smartphones. The system presented is efficient as it allows for the quick generation of random values with sufficient unpredictability, making it suitable for use in various applications across different fields, despite being designed for cryptographic purposes. The results contribute to the development of hardware and software-environment basis for further improvements in random sequence generators.
