Modern electronic system users trust their personal data and resources are well-protected. This trust is based on the belief that the service provider has taken all necessary precautions to prevent failure. The complex protection and user administration system can deter users from utilizing market-offered services. To ensure top-tier professional care, communication systems have created their own protection systems, capable of withstanding all known attack types. But professional systems must strike a balance between functionality and user protection. Their services are tailored to familiar infrastructure and typically use the SSL/TLS protocol for protection, utilizing known user data (username and password). This achieves a balance between functionality and security, often overlooking safety rules and authentication based on user possession and identity. This paper explores the potential for implementing a solution that maintains system functionality while introducing a different safe authentication principle, something the user possesses. It details the development process and features of solutions guided by these principles, thereby enhancing the reliability of SSL/TLS authentication across multiple channels.
