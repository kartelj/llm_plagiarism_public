This thesis aimed to evaluate the state of patients with neuro-motor diseases utilizing sensor networks in health care, and to determine if tennis is a more effective rehabilitation method than conventional processes. An additional aim was to demonstrate that these sensor networks are increasingly vulnerable, a critical factor to monitor. The thesis compared the progress and recovery of two patients of similar age, strength, and physique, one undergoing standard rehabilitation, and the other using tennis for recovery. Additionally, the progress of the entire group was compared to a control group. The thesis also analyzed the sensor networks used in health care, their security, and safe installation. The research concluded that patients rehabilitated with tennis improved more quickly and effectively, their stroke power was stronger at the end of the study than patients undergoing standard rehabilitation methods. Therefore, the research was successful. My other hypothesis was also confirmed, as technological advancements have led to more frequent security breaches in various networks.
