The doctoral thesis focuses on contemporary problems associated with cryptographic key exchange and user authentication in a confidential communication system. The study examines existing solutions in the research field and the development of a proprietary secret communication system. The academic objective of the thesis is to enhance the protocol for swapping cryptographic keys based on electronic identification (eID). The existing research approaches were scrutinized with the aim to boost the protection level during confidential communication and lay the groundwork for the creation of a proprietary system. By integrating cryptographic methods that guarantee confidentiality, authenticity, and integrity, and utilizing steganographic methods for clandestine information exchange, the proposed system users are afforded the ability to share secret messages securely and efficiently. Upon analyzing the research results, it was determined that it is reasonable to use in secrecy for the exchange of cryptographic keys utilizing electronic identification communication.
