In the early 21st century, IT became an essential component of education. The main challenges during this time were procuring equipment and integrating information technology into contemporary education. Many developing countries underutilize the significant features of this technology, primarily due to inadequate technical resources in schools and lack of teacher training for its use. Most schools utilize software that is proprietary to IT companies, who sell these products at steep prices. The goal of this study is to introduce a novel research focus in the realm of information systems and education. Specifically, this study highlights the potential and influence of Open Source Software (OSS). This subject is highly pertinent in professional circles, as Munich has chosen to transition to OSS to significantly save funds. Now, several EU countries are contemplating transitioning their computer systems to OSS, with some already taking initial steps in this direction. This subject warrants examination from various perspectives, including economic, technological, pedagogical, sociological, cultural, legal, and others. This paper presents a comparison between Microsoft Windows and Linux operating systems, a current topic in the IT world regarding their applicability and superiority. It also examines the technological competition between Open Source and proprietary software code, considering their origins and development philosophies. In demonstrating the compatibility of these systems on identical hardware as their competitors, we conducted tests that show the potential of both systems on the same hardware architectures.
