Government, military, police, and security agencies use professional systems that demand the utmost level of communication security. These systems cannot depend on publicly accessible protection systems. Additionally, they cannot trust security systems not developed internally and whose operational principles or potential design and implementation flaws are externally known. To achieve the highest level of communication security, professional systems must create their own protection systems, resistant to all known attack forms. Comprehensive communication system development entails component development at all levels - from user interface to communication infrastructure. Such development necessitates substantial resources and investments, along with adequate development, testing, and debugging time. This paper explores the potential uses of public communication infrastructures and technologies for creating and using a system that provides the highest possible level of communication security. The paper outlines the detailed development process and features of a solution based on integrating proprietary ciphers on the network communication layer.
