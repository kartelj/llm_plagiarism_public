Studies indicate that the majority of end-users have transitioned from social networking to communication platforms (Viber, WhatsApp, FB messenger, Instagram, etc.). Artificial intelligence, coupled with the concept of digital transformation, is a significant stride in modernizing business companies across various industries. Amidst the COVID 19 fight and the creation of innovative solutions offering additional value, the chatbot was introduced to the digital realm. It is a software that simulates human interaction, assisting users in obtaining accurate information and simplifying daily services. Over the past decade, the considerable advancement of communication platforms and networking technologies has created new technical possibilities for the implementation of chatbots in diverse sectors, including e-commerce, customer support, marketing, and education. The Chatbot is a software application that mimics conversation utilizing artificial intelligence and engages in dialogue with humans using natural language understanding via text and voice messages. Chatbot employs artificial intelligence to discover answers and address user queries. In line with emerging trends, a methodological framework for the development of modern chatbot architecture based on artificial intelligence for the next generation of internet users is outlined. Consequently, the most significant challenge in developing the adaptive platform is addressing the issue of integration flexibility, defining the mechanism for chatbot independence from a single service for natural language understanding (NLU), which would ensure adequate adaptability. The suggested methodology offers a generic procedure and is the result of integrating different methodological approaches. As per the outlined methodology, the process of developing an adaptive chatbot based on NLU is split into two fundamental phases: project engineering and application engineering. Each of these phases is then subdivided into activities. The benefit of this division is the creation of an adaptable platform for generating chatbots. A scalable and expandable chatbot architecture supporting various services for natural language understanding and communication channels is also proposed. The paper details the logical and physical architecture of chatbots. The independence of the NLU service is guaranteed through suitable metamodels and their mapping rules. The thesis presents its own independent framework for reducing reliance on suppliers that provide services for natural language understanding and communication channels. This approach ensures independence from any service for understanding natural language, which will not restrict the solution to one service, but the proposed mechanism will facilitate easy mapping and switching from one to another new NLU service. Lastly, one implementation of the proposed solution is summarized through a case study. The Academic Digital Assistant (ADA) is the inaugural educational project in the Balkans that enhances communication, saves time, and delivers services more rapidly and efficiently. The ADA receives messages from various messaging communication platforms (Viber, FB Messenger, Instagram, and the website). The chatbot platform performs several crucial tasks before sending a message to the NLU. The NLU analyzes the text using machine learning techniques, compares, and then generates intent and its entities. The generated result is sent back to the chatbot platform, which uses a specific algorithm of intent, entities, and context and sends a response to the user in the appropriate format to display the message. ADA is available 24 hours a day and provides answers to frequently asked questions from students and prospective students. ADA is knowledgeable about over 250 scenarios regarding questions an appropriate service that students want to be performed. Some of the scenarios are exam registration, change of examiner, semester certification, information on teacher consultations, deadlines, academy ranking, lecture schedule, student rating, events, service availability, academic environment, date of lectures and exams, activities taking place within the academy and other useful academic information.
