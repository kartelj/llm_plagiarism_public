Digital images and their processing have significantly advanced medicine, a field where such progress was crucial. Computerized processing of medical digital images can expediently expedite diagnosis by highlighting minor tissue changes undetectable to the human eye. Medical image processing involves images from diverse sources like X-ray, ultrasound, magnetic resonance, and various devices such as scanners, microscopic images, endoscopic capsules, etc. Continuous advancements in medical imaging technology have resulted in high-resolution, three-dimensional anatomical, and physiological images. However, these advancements have also brought forth new issues and challenges in medical image processing. Many of these challenges are complex optimization problems for which nature-inspired algorithms, particularly swarm intelligence algorithms, have been effectively employed for over twenty years. To use these algorithms for medical digital image processing optimization issues, they need to be tailored and adjusted for a specific problem. This area is an active research field, evidenced by the multitude of scientific and professional articles, books, journals, and conferences devoted to it. This thesis presents several swarm intelligence algorithms and their application to different medical digital image processing optimization issues. Specifically, the bat algorithm, fireworks algorithm, and firefly algorithm were utilized for retina image registration, brain MRI segmentation, bleeding detection in endoscopic capsule images, image compression, leukemia detection in microscopic images, and emphysema detection in CT lung images. Each problem considered is unique, and swarm intelligence algorithms have been modified to address them. Customized swarm intelligence algorithms for use in medical digital image processing were tested on standard benchmark test images assembled for the problems being studied. Comparisons of methods for enhancing medical digital image processing using swarm intelligence algorithms with other cutting-edge algorithms from literature showed superior results, leading to the conclusion that better methods and techniques for solving optimization problems arising in the analysis and processing of medical digital images can be found by adapting and applying swarm intelligence algorithms.
