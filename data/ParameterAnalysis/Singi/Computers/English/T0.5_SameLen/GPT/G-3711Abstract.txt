The Distance Learning System (DLS) is a modern educational concept that is quickly becoming universally accepted. The DLS is built on a tutoring system and its various modules (assistant module, tutor module, emotion tracking and recognition modules, motivational modules, etc.) which work in conjunction with feedback from the system. The modular design of the DLS is important for its correctional roles, adaptability, automation process and self-adaptation. This new DLS concept has allowed for the easy implementation, widespread use and increased functionality of modern Learning Management Systems (LMS). LMS are used to create, organize, execute, manage and validate classes in relation to the educational environment. Defining the educational environment and preparing for class begins with identifying student characteristics, student groups, and segmenting them based on their predispositions, prior knowledge, and direction. In essence, we must understand the traits, tendencies and abilities of each individual student. During class enrollment, class time and particularly when faced with challenging mathematical problems, misunderstandings and confusion will arise. This can lead to a range of emotions, inattention, concentration and motivation lapses. This is when the DLS and its modules signal irregularities and a decrease in study quality that no longer aligns with each student's individual needs. The corrective function module should help address this issue. That's why it's crucial from the start to identify student characteristics and valid educational environment factors. In this regard, each individual student or student group must be assigned the appropriate combination of DLS modules to successfully keep up with the class and provide a quality assessment at the end of the course. All these different factors that define the educational environment must be assigned weighting coefficients due to their consequential effects. Looking back, it's essential to create mathematical modules based on two types of information that will provide a suitable grade for each student participating in the distance learning program. The first type of information considers the grade point average, grades from similar subjects obtained during previous education stages, the student's motivation level, etc. The second type of information is based on the emotional responses students display when faced with tasks and assignments as part of their classes, which are designed to master the course material. In addition to this, it's necessary to create mathematical models that include multi-criteria grading of certain DLS study platforms, all with the aim of correlating specific situations with the teaching process, all in the best interest of each individual student or student groups. Sometimes it's not possible to simply apply this multi-criteria grading method due to the method's structure. So, while working, to achieve the best possible results, a specific grading method is created for each specific case i.e. educational environment.
