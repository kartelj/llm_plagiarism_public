Modern businesses grapple daily with information and data overload, making it challenging to conduct operations and make effective decisions. It's crucial for these companies to effectively implement management knowledge to enhance their business activities. Furthermore, safeguarding access to organizational memory (company knowledge), its trade, and management, is a new focus area for many companies. The adoption of management intelligence, enabling companies to manage organizational memory, is becoming a vital part of successful business strategies. Despite its complexity, integrated automated organizational memory management (company knowledge) is a solution that bridges knowledge management and information technology. This makes it easier for a company to elucidate decision-making processes and manage the flow of documentation, information, and data. With integrated automated organizational memory management, companies can access detailed data that facilitates decision-making. However, this integrated automated process also needs protection. In line with international standards (ISO 27001), management should establish a model for implementing, handling, monitoring, reviewing, maintaining, and improving the security of the organization's memory management system. The balance between user requirements, organizational memory functionality, and the need to protect sensitive data and maintain their integrity should be met by securing the organization's memory with a cryptographic solution. This integrated automated organizational memory management process could be utilized in intelligent learning systems and modern business decision-making systems. Digital signatures would confirm the authenticity and immutability of documents, a feature provided by the proposed cryptographic solutions in accordance with current electronic document laws. This paper will propose a method to protect the integrated memory management system by encrypting them, making the data accessible only through the company's information system. It will present a unique cryptographic solution for protecting the organization's memory from a knowledge management perspective. Access to documents and data would be granted only to system users with explicit authorization through the permission management system. Digital signatures would confirm the authenticity and immutability of documents, a feature provided by the proposed cryptographic solutions in accordance with current electronic document laws. The discussion will cover principles and models that offer data protection and privileged data access, all aimed at facilitating decision-making based on the organization's memory. Security information agencies serve as the best examples for such an analysis, with numerous examples of both successful organizations and lapses in their operations.
