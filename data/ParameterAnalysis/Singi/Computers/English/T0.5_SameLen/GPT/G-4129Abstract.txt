The proposed work introduces a unique method for cryptographically secure biometric authentication, utilizing public key cryptography, a pseudo-random number generator, and cancelable biometrics. During all system usage stages except feature extraction, biometric templates are either encrypted or cancelable, providing security against various attacks. Moreover, the system does not require extensive computation, and the biometric template size is reasonable. The suggested method for cryptographically secure authentication is employed via a modular biometric system for mobile banking user verification, leveraging human eye iris biometrics. Both the system's performance and the randomness of the biometric templates and data transmitted over the network in this application scenario receive positive evaluations based on realistic data.
