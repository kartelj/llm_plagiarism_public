The dissertation's focus is the exploration of e-business systems interoperability models, underpinned by service-oriented software development, viewed from various angles. The research took into account: standards, interoperability frameworks and enterprise information systems architecture, ontology-based semantic technologies, and service orientation. By assessing the present situation, best practices and developments, the dissertation offers solutions to interoperability issues by introducing: a methodological structure for linking e-business systems on an ad-hoc basis, a universal meta model for ensuring semantic system consistency as well as component description and discovery in e-business systems; a service-oriented architecture model for semantic interoperability of business processes on an ad-hoc basis. Research validation was carried out by creating interoperability and enhancing business process execution in the cultural heritage protection fields. The results attained have enhanced the utilization of existing information, documents and visual material referring to various kinds of cultural artifacts.
