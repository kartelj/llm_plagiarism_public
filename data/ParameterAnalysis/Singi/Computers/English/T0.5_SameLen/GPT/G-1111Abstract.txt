The issue of stock-outs is a major challenge in the retail industry as it directly results in lost sales, diminished profits, and potential customer loss. The stock-out rate is largely influenced by the operational practices of retail chains and can greatly differ due to various factors, with the global average being between 5 - 10%. This high rate of stock-outs can result in an average financial loss of 4% of the total turnover for the retail chain. This study aimed to explore all relevant elements that could cause an increase in stock-outs in retail, and the potential of automated ordering systems to address these issues. The literature review included organizational, operational, and technological aspects of the stock-out issue. An in-depth analysis of the stock-out issue and different concepts of automated ordering systems in retail provided the necessary conditions for measuring the effectiveness of automated ordering systems. The study's main objective was to determine the relationship between different stock- keeping unit (SKU) attributes and stock-out performance in the retail industry, and to assess the ability of automated ordering systems to handle the challenges associated with risky SKUs. The data sample was obtained from a large Serbian retailer and included two high-risk product categories comprising a total of 115 items and 97 stores, observed over a one-year period. A perpetual inventory aggregation method was used to identify stock-outs, while probit regression and t-test statistics were used to measure the impact of SKU attributes and the performance of the ordering system. Prior to the main statistical analysis, an analysis of the stock-out rate identified certain patterns of stock-out variation, such as weekly fluctuations, performance differences between SKUs and product categories, which could reveal potential causes of stock-outs and provide valuable input for further analysis. The impact of potentially high-risk SKU attributes on stock-out performance showed that product availability in the distribution center, promotional activity, and sales speed negatively affect stock-out performance. Positive effects, in terms of a reduced number of stock-outs, were observed when the ordering process was performed using the automated ordering system. However, the retailer-risk category proved to be more sensitive to promotion and sales speed. The statistical analysis showed that the automated ordering system performs significantly better than the manual system in relation to cheaper items, promoted items, faster items, and items with large sales variation, while this was not proven for items with larger packaging. In contrast to the improved performance at the store level, a significantly better performance was not recorded at the distribution center level for items ordered automatically compared to those ordered manually.
