We observe mobile devices becoming an integral part of our daily lives, largely due to social media and quick news updates. A decade ago, mobile apps were created specifically for unique functions and their operational capabilities were significantly inferior to current ones. This evolution in mobile devices has spurred growth in related scientific fields that seemed unrelated but found synergy through the advancement of these devices and their apps. This primarily includes telecommunications, electronics, software engineering, and internet technology. Rapid advances in these sectors have allowed mobile devices to match the functionality of traditional PCs and continue to progress. A key limitation, however, is the device's autonomy and power independence. Current battery technology restricts significant device autonomy. Market demands include faster processors, slimmer devices, larger screens, and crucially, mobile internet functionality. Device manufacturers aim to maintain these features while enhancing energy efficiency and independence. This can be achieved through hardware and software innovations. It's well known that internet usage drains power, indicating a need for optimization. A solution lies in the current mobile services model. Most mobile apps function on a master-slave communication principle with various servers, exchanging significant data. Whether it's simple message reading or weather forecast apps, social networks, or online strategies, complex data structures are sent and received. In the era of object-oriented programming languages, this data can be treated as lists and class instance series, or objects. The process of packing and unpacking these complex data structures into byte series suitable for transmission is known as data serialization. This paper presents research into energy-efficient serialized data transmission between servers and mobile devices. A test environment was established to measure power consumption during server communication. These measurements were used to create a mathematical model incorporating functions representing serialization time and serialized file size. This data was used to develop an experimental API-CBSaver, which uses mathematical models to select the most efficient serialization and compression method in real time. The API-CBSaver test results provide guidance for enhancing energy efficiency.
