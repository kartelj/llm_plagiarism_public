During the rapid growth of information technology, its extensive use in education became apparent. Numerous educational institutions have integrated the DLS education platform, partly supplementing traditional teaching methods. However, an increasing number of tertiary institutions globally and domestically have adopted this training style, facilitating distance education. This paper aims to depict the current quality status of DLS e-learning systems. The progression of e-learning model schemes has been examined, and potential future pathways have been suggested. The employment of learning management systems, intelligent tutoring systems, and adaptive educational hypermedia systems in education has enabled the accumulation of a vast wealth of information about student learning methods. Learning Management Systems (LMS) are utilized to create, organize, execute, and manage online courses and training programs, irrespective of their specific location and timing. Moodle (Modular Object Dynamic Learning Environment) is among the most prevalent learning management systems. This open-source system operates on a collection of PHP modules installed on the web server, and MySQL, Postgres databases. The focus was on enhancing student performance during exams and the technical elements of the e-learning system that could guarantee continuous system development amidst the swift evolution and application of information and communication technologies.
