The thesis explores the performance analysis of wireless transmission over α-k-µ-g and k-µ-g fading channels. It provides derived closed-form expressions for the probability density function (PDF) and cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for such a channel. The study also presents standard performance measures of the received signal, such as outage probability (OP) and level crossing rate (LCR) for this transmission scenario, considering different system parameter values. Additionally, the thesis examines the enhancement of these performance measures when space diversity is employed at reception. It considers several space diversity techniques, specifically selection combining (SC) and maximal-ratio combining (MRC), to illustrate how to lessen fading impact. Lastly, the research analyzes simultaneous multipath fading and shadowing occurrence, considering macro-diversity reception combining with micro-diversity combining to reduce these detrimental effects and enhance reception signal quality. The findings from the thesis indicate that the proposed approach ensures the reduction of harmful effects of observed α-k-µ-g and k-µ-g fading occurrence in various wireless transmission scenarios.
