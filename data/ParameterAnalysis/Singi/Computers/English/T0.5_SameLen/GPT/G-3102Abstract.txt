Cloud computing security is a multifaceted and intricate issue, intersecting with various fields such as computer network security, computer security, information security, legal regulation implementation, etc. Regrettably, it's one of the primary reasons why cloud computing isn't utilized to its full potential despite its remarkable advantages. One of the most secure methods for data preservation in the cloud is undoubtedly through cryptographic techniques. The security of encrypted data stored in the cloud relies solely on the security of the used cryptographic algorithms and keys. However, the downside of storing data as ciphertext in the cloud is the inability to process this data within the cloud without decrypting it, posing a security risk. Homomorphic cryptosystems may provide a solution to this issue. Their capability to process data in an encrypted form and produce encrypted results that only key holders can decrypt is considered by some as the holy grail of cryptography. Recently, the academic community has been heavily invested in researching and enhancing encryption methods that allow ciphertext processing in the cloud. Observing these trends, we found that the relationship between the encryption method applied to the cloud and systems with limited computing resources is underexplored and holds significant potential for everyday application. These insights guided our dissertation, where we examined and demonstrated how homomorphic encryption can be safely utilized for cloud applications. The dissertation's introduction presents the fundamental ideas that inspired our research, defines the research hypotheses, methods to be used, and outlines the expected scientific contribution. The second chapter explores cloud computing, detailing its historical development and defining it through literature review. The third chapter explains the concept of homomorphism in cipher systems using mathematical tools. The fourth chapter addresses the issue of enhancing encryption key security using a virtual file system. During the practical implementation of the cipher system, the storage and application of encryption keys proved crucial. We proposed storing encryption keys on Smart Card devices and implemented this solution in Unix/Linux operating systems, which was practically applied in our study. The fifth chapter outlines the dissertation's key scientific contributions, detailing the observed problem, proposing a simpler model experiment, and describing the implementation of the proposed solutions on two different platforms: the industrial computer Raspberry Pi and Android smartphones. Based on these results, we identified constraints regarding the length of the applied keys, the number of monitored sensors, and the length of the corrective function results of the proposed model. Throughout the chapters, we included parts of the developed code for Unix/Linux and Android operating systems used in the experiment. In conclusion, the thesis presents the fundamental scientific contributions and suggests directions for potential future research in this field.
