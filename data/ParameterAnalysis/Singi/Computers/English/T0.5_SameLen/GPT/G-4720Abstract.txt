Culture perpetuation shapes society, which in turn is developed through the enhancement and progression of culture and knowledge. Education serves as the vehicle for societal improvement, with a crucial aspect being the evaluation of acquired knowledge and practical skills. Among all natural and technical sciences, computer science frequently employs assessments to gauge students' practical skills. Various assessment techniques are used in education, with ongoing efforts to refine these methods for accurate and unbiased evaluation. Both outdated and current methods are documented in literature, with the most prevalent being closed question tests and practical work reviews and assessments. Tests are beneficial for gauging knowledge, while practical work reviews are useful for assessing practical skills. Both methods can be executed manually or automatically, with automated methods requiring configurations that allow execution sans examiner involvement. Professional experience indicates that manual student assessment, irrespective of the method, is challenging to conduct with necessary neutrality and precision. Therefore, automated assessments are recommended. However, employing these methods to determine both acquired knowledge and practical skills levels is problematic due to their incompatibility. This paper reviews literature to identify common issues and seeks a precise and unbiased method for assessing students' practical skills in programming-related subjects. Over the four-year study period, two student generations were assessed using two distinct solutions. One method employed an electronic multiple-choice test for knowledge assessment, while the other evaluated the correctness of students' practical work. The paper addresses several research questions, with answers derived from data analysis using these two assessment methods. Quantitative and qualitative research methods were used for data analysis. The paper also includes case studies of assessment methods used for these evaluations and data collection during the research period, with detailed discussions on the used assessment tools. The paper investigates the feasibility of an automated tool to replace the teacher as an examiner by automating practical work reviews and evaluations; it compares assessment results similarity from both methods; discusses the efficacy of tests in determining practical skills levels; and explores the possibility of unbiased assessments without examiner influence. The paper includes discussions on analyzed data and research conclusions. This research proposes a method for objective and precise assessment of practical skills in computer science programming-related subjects at the bachelor academic level, presenting solutions to achieve this goal. This research contributes both scientifically and practically.
