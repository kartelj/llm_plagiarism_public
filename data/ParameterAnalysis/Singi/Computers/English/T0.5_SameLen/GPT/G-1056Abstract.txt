Predictions suggest that the future of information security should bring about a significant transformation and a fundamental shift towards a new theoretical computer security paradigm. This change would enable the integration of a range of protection mechanisms, the compromise of which would no longer rely on the attacker's computational power. It's worth noting that the prerequisite for this proposition is the development of novel digital signal processing methods that the physical layer of contemporary communication networks should provide sufficient information. Pure random extraction could be utilized in creating new protocols and encryption key exchanges with maximum length and uncertainty. In terms of reliable and acceptable authentication practices, biometrics is becoming a crucial source of cryptology parameters. The digital signal processing of biometrics is vital for establishing and extracting maximum entropy authentication codes. In the domain of digital content copyright management, visible and invisible digital embossing seals are also crucial. All these factors contribute to a new position for this discipline in the theory and practice of comprehensive information protection systems. The proposed study identifies, analyzes, and develops a class of digital signal processing subsystems to meet the emerging requirements stemming from these new advancements in computer systems and modern communication information protection. The primary focus is on developing a class of encryption key systems based on iris biometrics.
