Mobile phone usage is growing continuously. Looking at mobile device history, we can see that manufacturers have developed highly advanced devices now known as smartphones. Their enhanced capabilities and impacts on our daily lives make us increasingly reliant on modern mobile phones. Smartphones are utilized for phone calls, internet browsing, various services (SMS, MMS, email), and as cameras or GPS devices. As mobile technology evolves, initial security issues arise, affecting the communication channel, or data transfer from sender to receiver. Security threats are growing due to insufficient security mechanisms and protection tools. The introduction of mobile operating systems further complicates this issue. Each operating system provides numerous user benefits but also many security vulnerabilities. Considering the rising popularity of internet access via mobile devices, there are risks associated with secure communication and establishing a communication channel. The widespread use of mobile devices necessitates examining mobile communication security for all users. Open source projects give developers a wide range to create solutions based on their ideas. Access to an operating system's source code created an operating system that outperformed all others, becoming the mobile phone market leader. The Android operating system quickly became popular among developers and beyond due to its reliance on the Java programming language. Android serves as an open platform for mobile devices, allowing modifications even at the operating system level. This allows developers to create unique security mechanisms not typical for other mobile platforms. The Android operating system is based on the Linux operating system and is part of an Open Source Association. In the seven years since its creation up to the writing of this paper, the Android operating system has evolved to version 7.0. This paper analyzes Android's security mechanisms, identifies certain deficiencies in its low-level security framework, and suggests improvements based on a detailed analysis. The survey results indicate a lack of user knowledge in mobile phone internet safety. Measures to enhance the security framework of Android using SE Linux were proposed. A comparison was made between the AOSP (Android Open Source Project) and the proposed SE Android (Security Enhanced) system. The paper concludes with future work directions.
