The doctoral thesis, Posthuman Gaze: Automated Images in Contemporary Cinema, focuses on the exploration of automated images as a form of expression in modern cinema, viewed through the lens of current cinema modes in the digital media era. In a time where digital moving images are ubiquitous, the origin of the image is often unclear. Whether from our computer cameras, our device lenses, or surveillance systems, images are created automatically and algorithmically. The thesis will investigate how these seemingly random and independent images influence contemporary cinema. Hence, cinema will be treated as an artistic medium with inherent transdisciplinarity. With this in mind, the primary goal of the thesis is to analyze how the postcinematic culture (where film production and reception technologies are subordinated under dramatically different power dynamics) mirrors the relationship between the human subject and his societal, neoliberal, technocentric environment, closely tied to the posthumanist context. The introduction lays out the methodological groundwork of the thesis, which comprises theoretical and empirical research, established through the review and analysis of the theoretical framework and relies on an interdisciplinary approach to the subject. The first chapter provides the theoretical foundation for the concept of automated image. In the second chapter, the concept of automated image is contextualized within posthumanist studies, while the third chapter clarifies the terminological and structural groundwork for potential analysis of automated image as a film medium. The fourth, fifth, and sixth chapters handle specific case studies, namely, analysis of automated images in contemporary cinema, through reviews of surveillance camera films, computer screen films, and landscape films, as emerging genres and filmmaking trends. Chosen case studies suggest a general trend to deconstruct the traditional film narrative style by employing unconventional film techniques to align the content with the currents of today's screen culture, which demands a new comprehension of contemporary scopic regimes. Therefore, the thesis provides a critical tool for understanding the trends of contemporary digital cinema as a consequence of posthumanist discourse.
