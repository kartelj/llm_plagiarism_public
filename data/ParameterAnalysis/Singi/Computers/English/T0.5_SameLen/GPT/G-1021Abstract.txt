Considering our planet is home to over 7 billion people, with an estimated population growth to about 9 billion by 2050, identifying individuals while maintaining their privacy is a significant challenge. In terms of collective security, many governments and security agencies have prioritized authentication via biometric identification. Moreover, several privately owned companies are also participating in the development of biometric identification technology, seizing the opportunity to access a lucrative market previously reserved for the government sector. Despite economic issues, the United States, being the most economically and technologically advanced country, invests heavily in biometric identification, particularly following the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001. Besides the U.S., China, which experienced impressive economic growth during the global economic crisis, is also exerting considerable effort in developing biometric identification mechanisms. Given that China is the most populated country, the challenge of biometric identification takes on a new dimension. In India, the reason for introducing biometric identification technology is fundamentally different from that of the United States and most other countries, as it is not linked to security but rather to a more crucial issue - food distribution. The European Union, led by the Netherlands, is also heavily invested in the development and application of biometric identification. The privacy of collected biometric data primarily depends on the policies and attitudes of organizations responsible for acquiring and storing biometric data and the methods used to protect this data. Even if these organizations are state institutions - considered "trusted" institutions - misuse remains a constant threat. Balancing security and privacy is a topic of interest for many researchers worldwide. Over the past few decades, a variety of approaches to this issue have been proposed. The advancement of information technology has facilitated the development of new strategies due to new opportunities. It's important to note that biometric data are "noisy" data, meaning they don't always represent in the same way. As a result, certain principles of reasoning in classical logic cannot be directly applied in this field. Additionally, the use of cryptographic procedures with biometric data is not possible because biometric data do not meet the criteria required by cryptography. Fuzzy Logic offers a novel approach that aligns with human thought processes and has been used in various considerations and proposed solutions for biometric identification. Some of these solutions suggest extracting cryptographic keys directly from the biometric data using fuzzy extractor functions. These functions account for the uncertainty of biometric data measurements. After introducing randomization and employing specific procedures, the fuzzy extractor function generates a unique "key" - a fuzzy sketch. Conversely, other solutions propose independently creating a cryptographic key that meets all cryptographic requirements and then combining it with the biometric data. Within this group of proposed solutions, various error-correcting methods are used to compensate for the fuzziness of the biometric data. Some authors recommend using a sequence of error-correcting methods. The media for archiving can vary, but a polycarbonate card with a microcontroller is often suggested. Previous solutions can be evaluated from multiple perspectives and thus can be distinguished by their strengths and weaknesses. The main disadvantage of solutions involving a fuzzy sketch is the exposure of biometric features in an open format during the decoding process. Additionally, the process of decrypting a fuzzy sketch is not sufficiently reliable for practical applications. Solutions that independently create a cryptographic key and combine it with biometric data yield better results than those involving a sketch. There are also opinions that solutions involving a sketch could be improved by refining their mathematical models, but the primary shortcoming - the visibility of unprotected biometric data at some point in the process - remains. The use of different or sequentially combined error-correcting methods generally yields good results. Some of these solutions that treat the iris as biometric data produce accurate results. However, these solutions cannot be efficiently used for processing fingerprints due to the different nature of the binary representation of the iris and fingerprint. The solution proposed in this paper treats the fingerprint as biometric data. After identifying and distinguishing minutiae - the characteristic points of the fingerprint - two independent templates are created. The first template is used for the identification process, while the second template combines biometrics with a pre-built cryptographic key. The cryptographic key is previously processed with error correction encoding. The proposed solution uses Slepian Wolf encoding. The second template is encrypted biometric information with an incorporated cryptographic key. Both templates are then stored on a token such as a card with a microprocessor. During the reconstruction of the cryptographic key, the original biometric - the fingerprint - must be present. The first step is identification, which determines whether it is the same fingerprint, or the same person. After positive identification, key reconstruction is processed by separating the cryptographic key from the fingerprint and re-applying Slepian Wolf encoding to the cryptographic key to correct errors. Subsequently, the cryptographic key can be used in standard cryptographic operations. The proposed solution significantly reduces errors in person identification and in the process of cryptographic key reconstruction. Therefore, it is efficient and suitable for practical use. At the same time, it enhances the security of the original fingerprint image, which is not visible in an open format at any stage of the process. The solution outlined in this paper is resistant to a wide range of potential attacks when attackers aim to compromise biometric data and, consequently, the person's identity.
