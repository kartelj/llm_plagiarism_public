Currently, numerous swarm intelligence algorithms are effectively utilized to address diverse complex optimization issues. These algorithms universally include an operator for local search (exploitation) around identified promising solutions and a global search (exploration) operator to avoid local optima. Typically, swarm intelligence algorithms are initially trialed on unconstrained, constrained, or high-dimensional sets of standard test functions. They can also be enhanced, adapted, modified, hybridized, or paired with local search. The ultimate goal is to apply these metaheuristics to real-world optimization problems. The solution domains or search spaces for practical complex optimization problems can vary. Solutions may be vectors of real or integer numbers, or they might be more complex structures. Swarm intelligence algorithms need to be adapted for different search spaces, which could involve a simple adjustment of algorithm parameters or adaptation for integer solutions by rounding real solutions. However, for some search spaces, the algorithm must be almost entirely restructured, including exploitation and exploration operators, retaining only the guiding process or swarm intelligence. This dissertation presents several swarm intelligence algorithms and their adaptations for different search spaces and practical problem applications. The dissertation's objectives are to analyze and adapt swarm intelligence algorithms based on the fitness function and search space. The dissertation topic encompasses a thorough review of existing swarm intelligence algorithm implementations. It also includes a comparative analysis, highlighting the weaknesses and strengths of some algorithms compared to others, along with research into the adaptation of swarm intelligence algorithms for different search spaces and their practical problem applications. Problems with real solutions, such as support vector machine optimization, clustering, integer solutions like digital image segmentation problems, and problems where solutions have a unique structure, such as robot path planning and minimum weight triangulation, are considered. Modified and adapted swarm intelligence algorithms for different search spaces and practical problem applications were tested on standard test data sets and compared with other contemporary methods from literature for addressing the considered problems. Successful adaptations of swarm intelligence algorithms for various search spaces are demonstrated. Such adapted algorithms consistently achieved superior results in all cases compared to literature methods, leading to the conclusion that swarm intelligence algorithms can be adapted for various search spaces, including complex structures, and achieve improved results compared to literature methods.
