The necessity for defining cryptographic algorithms to ensure information security in cyber space is emphasized, with the aim to provide high-level data and communication protection, support high-speed communication, need minimal processing resources, and offer a highly compact implementation. This leads to a focus on sequential cryptographic algorithms, particularly the synthesis of pseudorandom generators with the specified characteristics. The objective of this work is to synthesize a set of reliable and efficient pseudorandom generators. A class of random processes, based on variable permutations, is outlined and its probabilistic and statistical properties are examined. This class of random processes is used as a reference model for defining the class of pseudorandom generators, parameterized with two pseudorandom sequences. The properties of the defined class of pseudorandom generators are analyzed using probability theory, information theory, and number theory. Conditions are identified under which the output sequence of the defined class of pseudorandom generators displays an asymptotically uniform distribution of output symbols. Correlation analysis reveals that the elements of the parameterizing sequences and the output sequence are asymptotically independent, resulting in the information carried by the output sequence about the generator's current internal state being asymptotically zero. An analysis of the output sequence period reveals that, with appropriate selection of parameterizing sequences, the output sequence period significantly exceeds that of the parameterizing sequences. These are the essential characteristics of cryptographic pseudorandom generators. The proposed construction's efficiency is achieved through its compactness and the selection of efficient pseudorandomly generated parameterizing sequences, such as those generated by multiple linear shift registers. Potential applications of the proposed class of reliable pseudorandom generators are presented.
