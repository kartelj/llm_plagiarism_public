This thesis introduces a category of systems that produce and disseminate cryptographic keys, leveraging multiple biometric methods. The conceptual framework incorporates two biometric methods: fingerprints and iris scans. In operational modes, the system utilizes the hash values derived in the first stage, namely the enrollment stage. Beyond these values, supplementary data is employed to render biometric information revocable, thereby safeguarding biometric data privacy. Furthermore, they offer security for cryptographic parameters. Iris biometrics, holding the most bio-information, were utilized to derive the secret key, while fingerprints serve for authentication. The empirical analysis, covering the thesis's full research scope, is grounded on samples from the CASIA biometric database. The obtained experimental outcomes suggest substantial contributions that significantly enhance the performance of this system category.
