This doctoral thesis proposes a new fingerprint biometric cryptosystem, utilizing the fuzzy commitment scheme and deep convolutional neural networks. The paper's primary contribution is a unique method for the automatic discretization of fingerprint texture descriptors, fully reliant on a convolutional neural network, and crafted to produce fixed-length templates. The suggested quantization of the extracted features through two-bit coding converts biometric templates into a binary domain, enabling the use of XOR biometrics and the creation of a biometric cryptosystem for key-release or as a safeguard for templates in fingerprint matching systems. The issue of biometric data variability is minimized by using secure block-level Bose–Chaudhuri–Hocquenghem error correction codes, which are resistant to statistical-based attacks. The proposed biometric cryptosystem can handle a 265-bit key length, fulfilling the demands of contemporary cryptographic systems, with a tolerable EER of 1%. The assessment reveals substantial performance improvements compared to other texture-based fingerprint matching and biometric cryptosystems.
