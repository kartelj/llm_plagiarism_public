This study aims to assess the competitiveness of Serbia's economy, the efficacy of its competitiveness policy, and the impact of clusters on regional competitiveness. The methodologies employed to validate these hypotheses were developed by the World Economic Forum, the Center for Strategy and Competitiveness, University of Stockholm, and the European Cluster Observatory. The objective of analyzing the contribution of robust clusters to regional competitiveness was to establish a relationship between the strength of clusters in different regions, as measured by the location quotient, and GDPpc, a productivity indicator, in the following five countries, hereafter referred to as G-5: Hungary, Bulgaria, Greece, Romania, and Serbia. The data used in this research was collected from the Statistical Office of Serbia, EUROSTAT, the World Economic Forum, and the European Cluster Observatory. The findings reveal a decline in Serbia's competitiveness indicators, particularly when compared to countries at a similar developmental stage, and the measures for competitiveness policy are inadequate and ineffective. Out of 20 cluster categories analyzed in the G-5 countries, 13 showed a positive correlation between the strength of clusters in the regions and regional competitiveness.
