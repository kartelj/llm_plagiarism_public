Mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) are self-configuring networks of nodes connected via wireless without any form of centralized administration. This kind of networks is currently one of the most important research subjects, due to the huge variety of applications (military, emergency, etc.). In MANETs each node acts both as host and as router, thus it must be capable of forwarding packets to other nodes. Because of the node mobility topologies of these networks change frequently. To solve these problems, special routing protocols for MANETs are needed. Traditional routing protocols used in wired networks cannot work efficiently in MANETs. The objective of this thesis is to research the current state of the art of existing routing protocols for MANETs, and compare different approaches. There are three main classes of routing protocols for MANETs: reactive, proactive and hybrid. By studying advantages and disadvantages of each one, a new routing protocol is proposed. The new scheme called OLSR-BF is proactive routing protocol mostly based on the existing OLSR routing protocol. Modification entered into a new routing protocol is based primarily on the use of Bellman- Ford algorithm in determining the shortest distance between nodes within a MANET network. In order to validate the design and performance of the new routing protocol it is qualitatively compared with existing AODV, DSDV and OLSR routing protocols.
