The objective of this study is to determine competit iveness level of Serbian economy, effectiveness of competitiveness policy in Serbia, and how the clusters, as tools for improving competitiveness, contribute to regional competitiveness in Serbia. To test these hypothesis, it has been used the methodologies developed by the World Economic Foru m, the Center for Strategy and Co mpetitiveness, University of Stockholm and the European Cluster Observatory. Aim of the how strong clusters contribute to regional competit iveness analysis, was to determine correlation between the clusters strength in the regions, measured by the location quotient, and GDPpc as an indicator of productivity, in the follo wing 5 countries (hereinafter referred to as G-5): Hungary, Bu lgaria, Greece, Ro man ia and Serbia. Statistical data, used in this study, are gathered from the Statistical Office of Serbia, EUROSTAT, the World Economic Foru m and the European Cluster Observatory. The analysis results show that the indicators of Serbian competitiveness weaken, especially compared to the other countries at the similar level of develop ment, and competitiveness policy measures are weak and insufficient. In G-5 countries, 13 of 20 analysed cluster categories had a positive correlation between clusters strength in the regions and regional competit iveness.
