It is necessary to mention and numerous law suites, especially those from International Courte of Law in Strazbourg â€“ France, conserning this problem. Presented solution is consists of authentic distributive information system and unique patented device for biometric identification of Parenthood, based on fingerprint minutiae. Information system and device provide synegia and efficenty of whole suggested solution, nad with 100% accuracy in real time guaratee identity of each new born baby and provide proof of Parenthood over them. Special attention was givven to security aspects of the system, knowing that are sensitive data. Standalone algorithms are developed for data acquisition and verification identity both mother and baby at a moment of birth and when leave birthplace, as well as procedures and time distance when to do that. Cancelable biometrics is used to provide total safetyfrom compromise data or corrupt safety in any way. Implementing this system will gain quality leap in this part of health care system in Republic of Serbia, considering institutions (birthplaces, hospitals), also as quality of service for its citizens.
