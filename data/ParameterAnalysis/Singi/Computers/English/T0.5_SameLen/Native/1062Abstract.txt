The subject of the dissertation is the research of e-business systems interoperability models, based on service-oriented software development, considered from different perspectives. The study considered: standards, frameworks for interoperability and enterprise information systems architecture, semantic technologies based on ontologies, and service orientation. Reviewing the current state, best practices and trends, dissertation contributes to solve interoperability problems by introducing: a methodological framework for connecting e-business systems on the ad-hoc basis, a generic meta model for providing semantic consistency of the system as well as description and discovery of components in e-business systems; a model of service- oriented architecture for semantic interoperability of business processes on an ad-hoc basis. Research verification has been done by establishing interoperability and improvement of business process execution in the areas of the cultural heritage protection. Achieved results have improved the use of available information, documents and illustrative material referring the different types of cultural artifacts.
