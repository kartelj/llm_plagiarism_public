The general goal of this research is to create a new, unified model of semiotics / axiology of discernment-interpretation-reasoning followed by its more focused application to visual objects, phenomena and media – commonly regarded as values or carriers of values – and to practices that either produce values or encode/encrypt values. Therefore, this research, this observation will not deal with every and each individual visual subject, and a linguistic expression used in different areas of human interest in values, but it will rather propose a general strategy, a principle method of reasoning about the conditions and reasons for creating different values, as well as the utterances, many expressions and words, historical and new, that is, to it will suggest a method of organization and classification in distinguishing, interpreting, reasoning, perceiving and evaluating sensory phenomena, and especially visual phenomena – the visual. In addition to a brief overview of the history of semiotic considerations, the theory thus produced will present a new interpretation and technical expressions of semiotics/axiology, the critical theory of signs/symbols, explain them and determine them, and then propose and demonstrate their application in the interpretation and evaluation of four sides (aesthetic, functional, moral-ethical, cognitive) sensory phenomena, with a special focus on the visual field of human sensitivity and on the visual appearance of phenomena, as well as on processes, media and media in the construction of artificial phenomena, as well as on sign/symbolic coding and decoding in the practices of visual arts, design, and communication design presented by historical examples. The specific aim of the research is to demonstrate and display the dynamics of semiotic differentiation-interpretation-evaluation of phenomena that necessarily presupposes and is inseparable and limited by anthropo-centrically generated dualities, primary polarities, such as: subject / object, real / unreal, true / false, / suitable / unsuitable, pleasant / unpleasant, functional / dysfunctional , etc., i.e. by the structurally set value polarities embodied in technofacts during five historical phases: Western Renaissance, pre-industrial, industrial, information and post-information periods, and to demonstrate how historical, culturally generated and semantically defined polarities chronologically tend to “equalize”, by (r)evolutions, turns and hierarchical reversals, and at the same time tend to reproduce, maintain the syntactic continuity and structural integrity of duality, that is to preserve the structurally primary polarity of the mathematical type +/-, by the means of analyzing historic events, examples and milestones that contributed to the semantic changes in polarity in the sense framework of creativity, innovation, historical increase in production, reproductive, multiplicative efficiency, and distribution of values.
