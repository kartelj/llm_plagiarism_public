It is estimated that the total area of information security in the future should provide a qualitative leap radical and fundamental paradigm shift to a new paradigm of theoretical computer security information security. This would allow the synthesis of the whole class of protection mechanisms, whose compromise would no longer be dependent on the computing power of an attacker. It is interesting to note that the prerequisite for this thesis is the development of new methods of digital signal processing that the physical layer of modern communication networks should provide sufficient information. Purely random extraction can be used in the establishment of new protocols and encryption key exchange with a maximum length and imprecision. In the field of reliable and acceptable practice for authentication, biometrics becomes an important source parameters cryptology. Source of digital signal processing biometric is essential to the establishment and to extract a maximum entropy codes authentication. In the field of copyright management of digital content on digital media and digital embossing seals, visible and invisible, are also an essential element. All this leads to a new place in this discipline in the theory and practice of general synthesis systems to protect information. In the proposed thesis identifies, analyzes and develops a class of subsystems digital signal processing to meet the new demands arising from these new developments in the protection of information in computer systems and modern communication. Working primarily on the development of a class of systems of encryption keys based on iris biometrics.
