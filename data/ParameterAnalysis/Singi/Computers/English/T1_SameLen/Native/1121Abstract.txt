This paper deals with exploring information retrieval of multimodal business documents in desktop environment. A document conveys information using multiple modalities, including text, layout/style and images. For example, journal articles usually have ﬁ gures to illustrate experimental results, and the title in a journal article usually has a diﬀ erent font size than the body text. Indexing and retrieval using only text is the traditional way of IR (Information Retrieval). With the development of the Internet and Digital Libraries, it becomes increasingly important to develop IR techniques for intelligent indexing and retrieval of multimodal documents. Indexing and retrieval are two important components of an IR system. Given a collection of documents, indexing describes documents using an index language. Retrieval uses the results of indexing and ﬁ nds related documents corresponding to a user’s query. Text and image modalities use diﬀ erent indexing and retrieval techniques. Single-modality IR, either using text or images, has limitations. Multimodal IR aims to overcome the limitations in each single modality by combining them.
