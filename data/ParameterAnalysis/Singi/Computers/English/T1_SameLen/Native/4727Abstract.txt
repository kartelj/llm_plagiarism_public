In this doctoral dissertation a novel fingerprint biometric cryptosystem based on the fuzzy commitment scheme and deep convolutional neural networks is proposed. The main contribution in this paper is novel approach to automatic discretization of fingerprint texture descriptors, entirely based on convolutional neural network, and designed to generate fixed-length templates. With the proposed quantization of the extracted features by two-bit coding, biometric templates are converted to a binary domain, which allows the application of XOR biometrics and the development of a biometric cryptosystem that can be used for key-release or as a template protection mechanism in fingerprint matching systems. The problem of biometric data variability is marginalized by applying the secure block-level Bose–Chaudhuri–Hocquenghem error correction codes, resistant to statistical-based attacks. The proposed biometric cryptosystem can manage a key length of 265 bits, which meets the requirements of modern cryptographic systems, with an acceptable EER of 1%. The evaluation shows significant performance gains when compared to other texture-based fingerprint matching and biometric cryptosystems.
