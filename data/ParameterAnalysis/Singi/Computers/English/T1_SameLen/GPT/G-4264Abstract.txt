The research carried out in this thesis helped establish the software structures and algorithms of adaptive systems that are relevant in the domain of light-controlled intersection traffic management. A computational model for the signal plan at a four-way intersection, controlled by traffic lights, with two or more stages of traffic under non-congested and congested traffic flow conditions, has been formulated. An in-depth analysis was performed, as well as an examination of the functions of the proposed adaptive systems for traffic management in situations where emergency vehicles are passing through the intersection, including when they are in the dilemma zone.
