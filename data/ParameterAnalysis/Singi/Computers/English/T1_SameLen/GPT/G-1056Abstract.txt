Predictions suggest that future advancements in information security should lead to a significant, fundamental shift to a new theoretical paradigm of computer security. This should facilitate an encompassing set of protective measures with resistance to the computational capabilities of attackers. Critical to this hypothesis is the development of innovative digital signal processing methods, which will help modern communication networks achieve sufficient data. The use of purely random extraction may benefit the development of new protocols and encryption key exchanges, increasing both length and uncertainty. In the sphere of trustworthy and acceptable user authentication, biometrics serve as valuable cryptographic parameters. Digital signal processing of biometrics is crucial in constructing and extracting maximum entropy authentication codes. In managing copyright of digital content, visible and invisible digital embossing seals become vital elements. These advancements place this discipline in a new position within the broader synthesis of information protection systems. The proposed research aims to identify, analyze and develop sets of digital signal processing subsystems, addressing the challenges brought forward by these unprecedented developments in information protection on computer systems and communication platforms. There is a focus on designing encryption key systems based on iris biometric technology.
