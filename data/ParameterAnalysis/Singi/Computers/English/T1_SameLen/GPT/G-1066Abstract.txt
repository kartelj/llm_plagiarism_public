The interdependence of supply and demand relies heavily on hotel businesses' marketing efforts. Analyzed in this study are a diverse group of Serbian hotels, different in facilities and services, both internally and relative to global competitors. Recent investments have allowed 4-star and 5-star hotels in Serbia to redefine their image with contemporary design, refined atmosphere, and cutting-edge amenities. This study will examine the status of these hotels on the social platform Facebook, determining the presence of Internet Distribution Systems (IDS) in sales, their impact on service quality, and the transformations they have incited in the hotel industry. The study will explore the intertwining relationship of IDS and Serbian hotel industry. Two empirical surveys were conducted, featuring a mixture of middle and high-level management respondents along with guests of the aforementioned hotels. Data was processed using statistical software IBM SPSS Statistics 22; descriptive statistics, Student's t test, chi square test, Importance Performance Analysis, and the analysis of variance (ANOVA) were utilized in the review. For the investigation into promotion, secondary data was parsed using Simply Measured tools.
