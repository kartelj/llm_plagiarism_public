Generating high-quality series of random numbers critically influences every cryptographic system, necessitating careful design and verification of generators' characteristics. The performance of random value generators based on sound cards is mostly dependent on the height of the randomness source of entropy and the applied post-processing procedure. By employing this technique, a distillation of the digitized form of random analog signal is produced, resulting in a set of truly random numbers of uniform distribution.

This dissertation focuses on analyzing existing and introducing a new class of random sequence generators based on a sound card. Random number sequences influence several fields, including cryptography, simulation, gambling, sampling, decision-making, medicine, aesthetics, and art. The most frequently utilized random values generator, the pseudorandom number generator (PRNG), is a mathematical algorithm that generates a deterministic, periodic array of numerical values identified as SID. In contrast, true random number generators (TRNG) make use of unpredictable natural phenomena like sound noise, radioactive decay, and various quantum phenomena to generate non-periodic true random numbers.

Numerous studies have been launched to optimize random numbers using sound cards, most of which rely on the needs of PRNGs or their structures. This dissertation presents an approach to generate true random bits based on the sound card of computer hardware, incorporating environmental random signal noise, and postprocessing (distillation) by mixing the input string and XOR-ing neighboring bits (Mibis & XOR). 

This post-processing method simplifies and efficiently removes adjacent bits of the input string with correlations, then XORs neighboring bits in the newly obtained set, reducing autocorrelation, increasing entropy and bias reduction of output bit sets. Statistical tests have verified that this class of generators has outstanding characteristics and generates high-quality true random numbers in a very short time. 

Chapters 2 and 3 of this dissertation present theoretical fundamentals for understanding the original contributions outlined in the second part. Chapter 2 introduces concepts of random process, random signal, and stochastic signal sources as essential factors needed to generate a series of real random numbers. Chapter 3 delves into the fundamentals of sound cards and environmental noise signals. 

Chapters 4 and 5 exhibit the original research results. Chapter 4 introduces the results from developing new methods of generating random sequences and outlines the basic characteristics of a true random number generator. Various post-processing techniques, their pros and cons, are also examined. Chapter 5 displays the results from applying new distillation techniques. 

The dissertation underscores the value and development of the process for acquiring true random sequences to produce random number generators that are fast, effective, inexpensive, and hence accessible to large populations. The study also facilitates the burgeoning development of novel, effective methods for producing random sequences using hardware from desktop systems and new types of laptops, tablets, and smartphones. The methodology enables fast generation of random values with sufficient unpredictability, suitable for various applications besides cryptographic purposes. 

The results contribute positively towards the development of hardware and software foundations for future improvements to random sequence generators.
