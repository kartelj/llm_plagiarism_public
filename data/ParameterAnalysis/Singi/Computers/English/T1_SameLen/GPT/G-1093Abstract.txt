"Customer Relationship Management (CRM) is the fundamental principle in contemporary retail businesses. CRM is a crucial component for survival in today's business environment for retail companies. The integration of CRM in retail involves establishing and maintaining long-lasting collaborative relationships with customers, aimed at creating lifelong value for both consumers and the retail companies. CRM sets itself apart from other relationship management concepts through its ability to form unique relationships with customers. The management of customer relationship changes depends heavily on accurate data and information about customer needs, desires, and behaviour. It also relies on the development of various modes of communication with customers, including verbal and non-verbal, personal and electronic. Managing these relationship changes encompasses changes in companies' attitudes towards customers and shifts in customers' attitudes towards retailers. Given the fluctuation and time sensitivity of retail and consumer relationships, it is crucial for modern retailers to execute a planned strategy for long-term customer relationship management. High-quality services, driven by comprehensive and researched data of customer needs, incite and stimulate customers' interest in retail company activities. This leads to improved customer satisfaction, trust, and ultimately, loyalty. The conducted research, whose findings will be disclosed in this thesis, assisted in recognizing key factors in forming consumer relationships, gaining their trust, and fostering their loyalty. It also helped identify factors of change and effective management strategies in customer relationships in Serbia's domestic retail market.
