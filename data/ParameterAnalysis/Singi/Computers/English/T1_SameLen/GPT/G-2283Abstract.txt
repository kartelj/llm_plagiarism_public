The purpose of this study is to assess the competitiveness of Serbia's economy, the efficacy of Serbia's competitiveness policy, and the role of clusters in enhancing regional competitiveness in Serbia. Our hypotheses were tested using methods established by entities such as the World Economic Forum, the Center for Strategy and Competitiveness, Stockholm University, and the European Cluster Observatory. The objective of evaluating how robust clusters can support regional competitiveness was to draw a connection between the power of clusters in different regions (measured by location quotient) and GDP per capita as a sign of productivity, in the ensuing 5 nations (hereafter dubbed G-5): Hungary, Bulgaria, Greece, Romania, and Serbia. The research utilised statistical data sourced from the Serbian Statistical Office, EUROSTAT, the World Economic Forum, and the European Cluster Observatory. Our analysis reveals that Serbia's competitiveness indicators are declining, particularly when compared with other nations at a comparable development stage, and their competitiveness policy initiatives are weak and insufficient. In the G-5, out of 20 cluster categories analysed, 13 showed a positive relationship between regional cluster strength and competitiveness.
