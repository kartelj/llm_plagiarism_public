The dissertation's subject explores e-business systems interoperability models' study via a service-oriented software development lens, evaluated from various viewpoints. The research incorporated: standards, interoperability frameworks and corporate information system architecture, ontologies-based semantic technologies, and service orientation. Evaluating the present conditions, finest techniques, and tendencies, the dissertation facilitates interoperability issues resolution by introducing: an ad-hoc basis connection methodological framework for e-business systems, a universal meta model that maintains semantic consistency of the system as well as component description and discovery in e-business systems; an ad-hoc basis service-oriented architecture model for semantic interoperability of business processes. The research validation occurred through defining interoperability and business process performance enhancement in the cultural heritage protection fields. The obtained results enhanced the utilization of available data, paperwork and descriptive materials referring to various kinds of cultural artifacts.
