In the present era, swarm intelligence algorithms effectively tackle many complex optimization issues. These algorithms have core elements such as the operator for local research (exploitation) focusing on identified potential solutions and the global research (exploration) operator aiding in escaping from local optima. Typically, these algorithms are put through initial testing on standard test functions within unconstrained, constrained, or high-dimensional sets. They can also be enhanced, adapted, modified, merged, or paired with local search. These metaheuristics are intended to be applied to real-life optimization problems. For practical complex optimization problems, the solution domains or search spaces can vary. Solutions may be real or integer number vectors, or they might have more intricate structures. It's necessary to adapt swarm intelligence algorithms to different search spaces, oftentimes requiring a total redesign of the algorithm, including exploitation and exploration operators. The only part retained is the guiding process or swarm intelligence. This dissertation presents various swarm intelligence algorithms and their modifications for different search spaces and practical applications. The dissertation's goals are to evaluate and modify swarm intelligence algorithms based on the fitness function and search space. The dissertation also provides an exhaustive review of existing implementations of swarm intelligence algorithms and comparative analysis, discussing the pros and cons of specific algorithms in comparison to others. Algorithms have been adapted for different search spaces like real solutions for support vector machine optimization, clustering, integer solutions for digital image segmentation issues, and solutions with special structures for robot path planning and minimum weight triangulation. Algorithms modified for different search spaces have been tested on standard test data sets and compared to other contemporary methods for solving these issues. Several triumphant adaptations of swarm intelligence algorithms for various search spaces are demonstrated, outperforming the methods mentioned in literature in all cases. This leads to a conclusion that swarm intelligence algorithms can be adjusted for numerous search spaces, including complex structures to produce superior results compared to the methods in literature.
