To ensure cybersecurity, we need to establish encryption algorithms that guarantee maximum data and communication security, provide ultra-fast communication rates, demand minimal processing resources, and possess an extremely condensed execution. These attributes suggest a group of sequential encryption algorithms is needed, specifically the construction of pseudorandom generators with these features. Based on the requirements, this study aims to create a set of trustworthy and effective pseudorandom generators. We defined a group of random procedures involving variable permutations and analyzed their probabilistic and statistical properties. This group of random procedures is used to as the definition template for pseudorandom generators parameterized by two pseudorandom sequences. Utilizing probability, information and number theories, we analyzed properties of the pseudorandom generators. We derived the conditions needed for the output sequences of the pseudorandom generators to have an asymptotically uniform distribution. From our correlation analysis, the parameterizing sequences and output sequences are asymptotically independent, hence an output element provides negligible information about the generator's current internal state. We found that when we select appropriate parameterizing sequences, the generated output sequence period greatly exceeds that of the parameterizing sequences, a crucial characteristic of cryptographic pseudorandom generators. The proposed model's effectiveness comes from its compactness and the choice of efficient pseudorandom generated parameterizing sequences, like those created by multiple linear shift registers. We also discuss potential uses of the proposed trustworthy pseudorandom generators.
