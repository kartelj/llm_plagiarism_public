This dissertation investigates the performance analysis of α-k-µ-g and k-µ-g fading channels in wireless transmission. The derived closed-form expressions illustrate the probability density function (PDF) and cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) received over these channels. The standard performance measures of the received signal, such as outage probability (OP) and level crossing rate (LCR), were determined in this transmission scenario, relative to the different system parameters values. Moreover, the enhancement of these performance measures was scrutinized when employing space diversity at reception. A variety of space diversity techniques, specifically selection combining (SC) and maximal-ratio combining (MRC), were considered in this dissertation to showcase how the effects of fading could be minimized. Lastly, the joint occurrence of multipath fading and shadowing was examined, with macro-diversity reception combining used in conjunction with micro-diversity combining to mitigate their destructive effects and enhance reception signal quality. The outcomes from this dissertation indicate that the suggested approach ensures the reduction of adverse effects from the observed α-k-µ-g and k-µ-g fading occurrences within diverse wireless transmission scenarios.
