The thesis introduces a group of systems designed to create and distribute cryptographic keys using various biometric methods. The theoretical structure incorporates two biometric methods: fingerprints and iris. In operation, the system exploits the hash values derived in the preliminary stage, or the enrollment stage. Alongside these values, supplementary data is employed to render biometric data revocable, thereby securing biometric data privacy. Furthermore, they offer safeguarding for cryptographic parameters. Iris biometrics, being the richest source of bio-information, was exploited for the extraction of the secret key, whilst fingerprints were utilized for verification. The analytical investigation, covering the full research dimension of the dissertation, is drawn from samples provided by the CASIA biometric database. The attained experimental outcomes highlight significant breakthroughs that considerably enhance this system familyâ€™s performance.
