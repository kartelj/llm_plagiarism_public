Modern corporations grapple daily with an information and data overload, which complicates their operations and hampers effective business decision-making. To streamline their business activities, these companies must devise an efficient method for leveraging management knowledge. Today, organizations pay more attention to properly securing and managing access to their institutional knowledge. Implementing management intelligence concepts, thus facilitating institutional knowledge management, is becoming a critical component of successful corporate strategies. Although intricate, integrated automated institutional knowledge management forms a solution for synergizing knowledge management and information technology. This enables companies to elucidate their decision-making process, as well as manage the flow of documentation, information, and data. An integrated automated knowledge management system allows a company to gain insightful data that simplifies business decision-making. The subsequent demand for security of such automated systems emerges, thus under international standards such as ISO 27001, managing institutional knowledge necessitates a model for establishing its implementation, supervision, inspection, upkeep, and enhancement. Balancing user requirements, functionality within institutional knowledge, and the necessity to safeguard sensitive data while upholding their integrity, becomes essential. This integrated automated industrial knowledge management process could be applicable in intelligent learning systems and modern business decision-making. Digital signatures can assure document authenticity and immutability, which aligns with current laws governing electronic documents. This paper focuses on recording these in an encrypted format, making the data accessible solely through the company's information system. It will expose the organization's unique cryptographic solution for knowledge protection centering on knowledge management. Only explicitly authorized users will have document and data access through an access permission administration system. The cryptographic solutions proposed would ensure document indisputability and immutability in accordance with electronic document regulations. The paper will also delve into principles and models that provide data protection and privileged data access, all geared towards effective decision making predicated on the organization's knowledge. Security information agencies serve as ideal examples of good practices and shortcomings in such an analysis.
