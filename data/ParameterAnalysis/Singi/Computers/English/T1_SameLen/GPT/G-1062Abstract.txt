The thesis centers around investigating e-business systems interoperability paradigms, taking a multi-layered approach, underpinned by service-oriented software development. Focal areas of the research included: standards, interoperability frameworks, and enterprise information systems design, ontological-based semantic technologies, as well as service orientation. A review of the current situation, best practices and impending trends saw the thesis offering solutions to interoperability issues by introducing the following: a methodological framework for ad-hoc connectivity of e-business systems, a universal meta model for ensuring semantic consistency and component discovery and description in e-business systems, and a model of service-oriented architecture for ad-hoc semantic interoperability of business procedures. Research confirmation was achieved by demonstrating interoperability and enhancing business process execution in the cultural heritage preservation sector. The attained results have ameliorated the utilization of current data, records, and illustration material related to various cultural artifacts.
