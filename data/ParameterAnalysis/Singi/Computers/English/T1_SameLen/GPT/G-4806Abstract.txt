Studies reveal that end users have primarily shifted their attention from social networking to communication platforms such as Viber, WhatsApp, FB Messenger, Instagram, etc. The integration of artificial intelligence and the concept of digital transformation play a critical role in bringing each business company up to date. The advent of the chatbot within the digital sphere, amid the battle against COVID 19 and in the bid to develop innovative solutions adding value, marks a significant stride. This software mimics human interaction, providing accurate information and smoothening everyday services for users. Over the past decade, the remarkable advancement of communication platforms and networking technologies has created new technical possibilities for implementing chatbots across various sectors, including e-commerce, customer support, marketing, and education. The Chatbot is a software that simulates conversation using artificial intelligence and interacts with humans using natural language understanding in textual and voice messages. It employs artificial intelligence to decipher and fulfill user demands. Keeping pace with current trends, a methodological framework for building modern chatbot architecture is laid out based on artificial intelligence for the forthcoming internet community generation. Hence, resolving the issue of flexibility integration, which represents the key challenge in developing an adaptive platform, as well as determining the autonomy mechanism of chatbots from a single NLU service to ensure sufficient adaptability. The recommended methodology offers a comprehensive procedure resulting from integrating various methodological approaches. Following the outlined methodology, the process of constructing an adaptive chatbot centered on NLU is split into two primary phases: project engineering and application engineering. Each phase is split further into activities. This separation benefits in the realization of an adaptable platform for generating chatbots. It also suggests scalable and extensible chatbot architecture that accommodates various NLU services and communication channels. The independence of the NLU service is affirmed through suitable metamodels and their mapping rules. The paper describes chatbots' logical and physical architecture. The thesis supplies an individual framework seeking to reduce dependency on providers offering natural language understanding and communication channel services. This results in gaining independence from any natural language understanding service, avoiding binding the solution to a singular service, and instead the proposed mechanism allows for simple mapping and transition from one to another new NLU service. Ultimately, an example of the suggested solution is provided through a case study. TheÂ Academic Digital Assistant (ADA) is the debut educational venture in the Balkans offering improved communication and swift, efficient service delivery. The ADA gets messages from various messaging communication platforms such as Viber, FB Messenger, Instagram, and website. Prior to transferring a message to NLU, the chatbot platform performs several crucial tasks. The NLU analyses the text utilizing machine learning techniques, compares, and subsequently generates intent and its entities. The generated result is returned to the chatbot platform that uses a specific algorithm of intent, entities, and context to reply to the user in a suitable format to present the message. Available 24/7, ADA provides answers to common questions from students and potential students. ADA covers over 250 scenarios related to questions regarding services students wish to have performed. These scenarios comprise things like exam registration, examiner replacement, semester certification, teacher consultation information, deadlines, academy status, lecture schedules, student ranking, events, service availability, academic environment, lecture and exam dates, activities within the academy and other handy academic information.
