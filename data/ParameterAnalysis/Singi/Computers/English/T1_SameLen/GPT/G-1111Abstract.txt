The phenomenon of stock-outs poses major challenges in retail, as it directly results in a loss of sales, diminished profits, and possible customer loss. The stock-out rate largely hinges on the retail chains' business practices and can drastically vary due to numerous influencing factors, but the worldwide average sits between 5 - 10%. Such a significant stock-out rate can lead to an average financial loss equating to 4% of a retail chain's total revenue. This study aimed to analyse all relevant elements that could impact the rise of stock-outs in retail, as well as the capabilities of an automated ordering system to mitigate these challenges. Accordingly, the literature review encompassed organizational, operational, and technological facets of the stock-out dilemma. A thorough investigation of the stock-out phenomenon and different automated ordering system concepts in retail established the conditions necessary to measure the effectiveness of automated ordering systems. The overarching aim of this research was to identify the relationship between various stock-keeping units' (SKU) attributes and stock-out performance in retail, and explore the automated ordering system's potential to address problems associated with risk-classified SKUs. The data sample was obtained from a major Serbian retailer and included two high-risk product categories, totaling 115 items from 97 stores, observed over a one-year period. A continual inventory aggregation method was employed to identify stock-outs, while probit regression and t-test statistics measured the impact of SKU attributes and ordering system performance. Prior to primary statistical analysis, an assessment of the stock-out rate identified patterns of stock-out variation, like weekly fluctuations, and performance differences between SKUs and product categories, offering valuable insights for further analysis. The effect of potentially high-risk SKU attributes on stock-out performance showed that product availability in distribution centres, promotional activity and sales velocity negatively affected stock-out performance. Beneficial outcomes, like reduced stock-outs, were noted with automated ordering system use. However, retailers categorized as risky were found to be more susceptible to promotion and sales velocity. Statistical analysis revealed that the automated ordering system significantly outperformed the manual one in terms of cheaper items, promotional items, fast-moving items, and items with substantial sales variations, though this wasn't proven with larger packaged items. Unlike improved performance at store level, superior performance wasn't recorded at the distribution centre level for items ordered automatically relative to items ordered manually.
