The intricacy of the adaptive e-education process has resulted in a limited number of studies examining its methodology and system integration to date. Due to this, the content provided within this report holds a unique significance. E-education is a multifaceted system encompassing distance learning and teaching, a variety of study materials, individual and collaborative learning, private tuition and interactive activities. It is beneficial to consider student preferences and learning styles to maximise the efficiency and effectiveness of e-education systems. Student preferences can be identified through business information systems, distance learning system data, survey data, and teacher evaluations. The adaptive process, which brings about system changes based on its knowledge of the student, uses these data. Adaptation can achieve key goals in e-education systems, such as enhancing course design and functionality, fostering student loyalty, supporting information retrieval, and enabling advanced searches and result storage relevant to student interests. This dissertation posits and confirms that integrating an adaptive model within an e-education LMS system can optimise the educational process, enhance business procedure quality, and make its implementation cost-effective. The proposed model can resolve remote education challenges like customising teaching content per student needs, an efficient reporting system based on LMS data, and creating an e-learning portal. Its deployment will result in augmented student enrolment and completions, cost reductions, better utilisation of funds, improved decision-making. This doctoral thesis delves into the use of adaptive methods in e-education for the purpose of creating an adaptive model for the subject Programming for Internet. An adaptive JAVA programming e-course is the chosen experiment, implemented at the Informatics lab at Sabac, Serbia's Professional Technology College. Standard statistical methods were used to analyse measured parameters, the findings revealed that students who undertook the adaptive course performed better than their counterparts in the non-adaptive course.
