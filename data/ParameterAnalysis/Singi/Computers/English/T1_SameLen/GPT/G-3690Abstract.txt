Digital imagery and image processing greatly contributed to advancements in medicine, a scientific field. Diagnoses can be expedited dramatically by processing medical digital images on computers, as they can reveal even the most subtle tissue alterations that are invisible to the human eye. Medical image processing encompasses images taken from various sources like X-ray, ultrasound, magnetic resonance and captured through varied devices including scanners, microscopic images, endoscopic capsules and others. Continuous advancements in medical imaging technology have given rise to high-quality, three-dimensional anatomical and physiological images. Concurrently, this growth has led to the emergence of new issues and difficulties in medical image processing. These challenges often encompass complex optimization problems where nature-inspired algorithms, specifically swarm intelligence algorithms, have demonstrated successful use for the past twenty-plus years. To utilize these algorithms for optimizing medical digital image processing issues, they must first be adjusted and altered for a specific problem. This active research area has garnered significant attention, evidenced by the plethora of scientific and professional publications, conferences, books and journals devoted to it. This dissertation presents the application of several swarm intelligence algorithms to a variety of medical digital image processing optimization problems, specifically the bat algorithm, fireworks algorithm and firefly algorithm, which were employed for retina image registration, brain MRI segmentation, detection of endoscopic capsule bleeding, image compression, detection of microscopic image leukemia and detection of emphysema in CT lung images. Each issue considered is unique, thus necessitating the adjustment of swarm intelligence algorithms suited to each problem. The modified swarm intelligence algorithms, tailor-made for medical digital image processing, were evaluated on standard benchmark tests assembled for the considered problems. The proposed methods for enhancing medical digital image processing using swarm intelligence algorithms were compared with other cutting-edge algorithms in current literature and were found to yield superior results. This suggests that by adjusting and implementing swarm intelligence algorithms, better methods and techniques for solving optimization issues encountered when examining and processing medical digital images can be discovered.
