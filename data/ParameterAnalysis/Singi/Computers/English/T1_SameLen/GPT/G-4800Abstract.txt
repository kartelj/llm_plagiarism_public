Today's two primary technologies are believed to be blockchain and the Internet of Things. Lessened delays and advancements in system connectivity have facilitated more flexible usage of applications on distant devices. The principal issue with the Internet of Things is its lack of sufficient computing resources; a lack of memory and underpowered processors that are designed to save energy prevent utilization of strong encryption algorithms. Numerous challenges face the Internet of Things, such as a lack of standards, security vulnerabilities, insufficient interoperability, and privacy. This article suggests the adoption of a software interface as a security gateway structure for smart gadgets. This security interface enables employing more robust encryption algorithms to remotely support smart devices. The approach enhances the security of data transmitted by smart devices via the use of compatible data encryption algorithms prior to being relayed to distant services. Besides the interface, this article also considers the use of blockchain technology. The motivation for incorporating blockchain is to bring decentralization and validation into a network of interconnected smart devices. The integration of blockchain itself offers the currently absent anonymity and flexibility in the Internet of Things. Blockchain secures the interface with its singular point control technologies, documenting and verifying all transactions, thereby fostering trust between devices within a singular network. The outcome of this study is the creation of an interface that enables smart devices to employ any encryption algorithm, offers the ability to assign IP addresses, and thus bars unauthorized network access. Besides developing the interface, the paper will also incorporate blockchain technology in a compatible fashion to ensure efficient operation on smart devices, taking into account their resource limitations.
