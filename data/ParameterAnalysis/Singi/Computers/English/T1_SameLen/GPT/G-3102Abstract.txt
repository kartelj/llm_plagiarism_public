The issues around cloud computing security are complicated and multifaceted, intersecting with domains like computer and information security, legal regulation enforcement, etc. This complex nature has contributed to its under-utilization despite its immense benefits. To secure data in the cloud, cryptographic methods are often employed. However, the security of stored ciphertext in the cloud solely relies on the security of the utilized cryptographic algorithms and keys. One disadvantage with storing ciphertext data in the cloud is that it's impossible to process such data within the cloud without first decrypting it, a process that poses a security threat. Homomorphic cryptosystems, capable of processing encrypted data into an encrypted form only decryptable by key holders, could solve this problem. In some circles, it's arguably the pinnacle of cryptography. In recent times, the academic world is intensively researching and improving encryption methods that will allow ciphertext processing within the cloud. Our research found that the relationship between the encryption method used for the cloud and systems with limited computation resources is slightly explored, despite the enormous potential for daily applications. Therefore, this dissertation explores the safe usage of homomorphic encryption in cloud applications. The first section introduces the study and outlines the methodologies, hypotheses to be tested, and anticipated scientific contributions. The second chapter discusses cloud computing history and definitions, while the third chapter explains homomorphic cipher systems and their theoretical basis. The fourth delves into enhancing encryption key security using virtual file systems. A practical solution involving Smart Card devices for key storage was introduced and implemented on Unix/Linux operating systems in this study. The fifth chapter summarizes the key scientific contributions of the dissertation, providing details on the issues noticed, the proposed simple model, and its implementation on Raspberry Pi industrial computers and Android phones. Based on these results, some implications on the length of the applied keys, the amount of monitored sensors, and the corrective function length of the proposed model are discussed. Portions of the developed Unix/Linux and Android operating system codes used in the experiment are featured in some chapters. In the concluding part, the thesis highlights main scientific contributions and suggests directions for future exploration in this field.
