'This doctoral dissertation is examining an efficient technological solution for guaranteeing the Identity of each newborn child that is both socially practical and compatible. In Serbia, there has been a substantial increase in the concerns surrounding theories of infant switching or theft in birthing centres in the past. There are also numerous court cases, particularly those from the International Court of Law in Strasbourg â€“ France. The proposed solution incorporates an original informational distribution system and a unique patented device specifically for biometric parental identification based on fingerprint minutiae. The system and device work synergistically to ensure the total efficiency of the proposed solution, guaranteeing 100% real-time accuracy in determining the identity of each new baby and verifying the parenthood. The system prioritizes security given the sensitive nature of the data. Independent algorithms have been developed specifically for data gathering and identity verification of the mother and baby at the time of birth and departure from the birthing centre. The use of cancellable biometrics ensures that the data is secure and not vulnerable to corruption. The system's implementation will lead to a quality improvement in health care, especially for births in Serbia. Considering the institutions involved and the quality of service for citizens, human error will be completely eliminated and the specification and subsequent procedures of the existing prenatal hospital system in Serbia will be streamlined. This doctoral dissertation will highlight a system that effectively prevents any possible identity changes, infant replacement or theft, and promises to significantly improve the speed and accuracy of services, guaranteeing real-time confirmation of parental rights."
