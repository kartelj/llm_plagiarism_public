The aim of this study is to construct a unified theory of semiotics/axiology for discernment, interpretation, and reasoning, and its specific application to visual entities, occurrences and media, typically perceived as value bearers or value creators. Consequently, the study will not involve every visual subject or every language expression related to value in various human interest areas, but will rather propose a general tactic or a primary reasoning method about the conditions and reasons for creating different values. It will also suggest an organization and classification method for distinguishing, interpreting, and reasoning sensory phenomena, particularly visual ones. In addition to a brief historical review of semiotic considerations, the resulting theory will offer a new interpretation and technical expressions of semiotics/axiology, elucidate and define them, and then suggest and showcase their application in the interpretation and evaluation of aesthetic, functional, moral-ethical, and cognitive sensory phenomena, especially those in human visual field. It will also focus on processes, media and media in the construction of artificial phenomena, as well as on sign coding and decoding in the practices of visual arts, design, and communication design illustrated by historical examples. The specific goal of the research is to demonstrate the dynamics of semiotic differentiation-interpretation-evaluation of phenomena necessarily presupposing anthropo-centered primary polarities. These polarities, such as: subject/object, real/unreal, true/false, and others are embodied in technofacts across various historical eras like the Western Renaissance, pre-industrial, industrial, information and post-information periods. They are also explained and demonstrated through historical events, examples and milestones that contribute to semantic polarity changes within the creative, innovative, historically increasing production, reproductive efficiency, and distribution of values framework.
