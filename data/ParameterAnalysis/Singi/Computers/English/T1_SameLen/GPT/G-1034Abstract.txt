Mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) are self-settling node systems connected wirelessly, operating without a centralized administration. These unique networks constitute one of the most significant research fields owing to their broad applications (military, emergency, etc.). In MANETs, each node functions as both host and router, therefore, it must be capable of transmitting packets to different nodes. Due to the mobility of nodes, the topology of these networks constantly changes. To rectify these issues, exclusive routing protocols for MANETs are required. Conventional routing protocols applied in wired networks are inefficient in MANETs. The aim of this thesis is to explore the latest existing MANET routing protocols, and contrast diverse methods. The three primary routing protocols for MANETs are reactive, proactive, and hybrid. After evaluating each type's pros and cons, a new routing protocol is suggested. The new proactive method, OLSR-BF, is primarily based on the pre-existing OLSR routing protocol. The updated routing protocol primarily utilizes the Bellman-Ford algorithm to identify the least distance between nodes within a MANET. To test and evaluate the new routing protocol's design and performance, it is qualitatively compared with existing AODV, DSDV, and OLSR routing protocols.
