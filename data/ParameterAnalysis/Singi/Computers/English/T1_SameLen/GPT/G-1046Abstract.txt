Modern electronic system users believe that personal data and resource protection is substantial. Their confidence stems from the presumption that the service provider ensures no failures occur. However, the intricate protection and user administration systems deter users from utilizing market-offered services. To maintain top-notch professionalism, communication systems have designed their own protective measures, armed against all recognized attack types. Yet, professional systems must straddle functionality and user protection. These services align with familiar infrastructure, and in most instances, are safeguarded by the SSL / TLS protocol using user-recognized data (username and password). Hence, a balance between functionality and security is maintained, neglecting safety rules and authentication factors like possession and identity. This research explores the potentiality of implementing a solution that maintains system functionality while incorporating safer authentication rules, tailored to user possession. Thorough examinations of solution development processes and features resulting from these principles are included in this paper, enhancing the reliability of SSL / TLS authentication via multiple channels.
