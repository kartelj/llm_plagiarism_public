Cloud computing, much like network computing, relies on the pooling of resources and the application of network and Internet technologies. It's a contemporary, vital multidisciplinary field, widely researched in top-tier international journals and discussions at globally recognized conferences. It essentially offers a novel approach to delivering computing resources as a service, encompassing data, software, and hardware components like processing elements, memory, and storage. Looking at global research findings, it's apparent that numerous issues and obstacles exist within cloud environments, and these can be more effectively addressed by implementing enhanced methods, techniques, and algorithms. A common challenge in cloud computing is scheduling user requests on limited resources or virtual machines. This problem revolves around arranging an execution schedule of tasks on these limited resources, considering potential constraints and objectives. Task scheduling is achieved using algorithms which are either static or dynamic. In static scheduling, tasks are allocated for execution prior to the enactment of the scheduling algorithm, with no option for dynamic task-switching. Dynamic scheduling, often referred to as load balancing, facilitates workload distribution during the execution of the scheduling algorithm, permitting dynamic task-switching. Heuristics and metaheuristics optimisation methods are predominantly used for dynamic scheduling with significant success. Task scheduling and load balancing in cloud computing are categorized as NP hard global or combinatorial problems, with or without constraints. When considering published research, it's clear that swarm intelligence metaheuristics have outperformed other methods, with superior convergence speed and solution quality, but the research in this dissertation aims to examine their potential to further enhance cloud computing scheduling and load balancing. Various swarm intelligence metaheuristics were adapted for this purpose, and the monarch butterfly and whale optimization algorithms were detailed in the final write-up. Simulations of the adapted algorithms were run within a robust CloudSim simulator environment, testing on both artificial and real data. Results confirmed the hypothesis of the dissertation, demonstrating the significant potential for swarm intelligence algorithms to enhance task scheduling and load balancing in cloud computing.
