A constant ability to improve the quality of products, services and software grants every company the flexibility to rapidly adapt to changes typical of modern market economies. Continuous refinement of product, service and software quality maintains a business's competitive edge. Quality advancement is only possible through the management of all elements impacting process input. In this paper, "product," defined as the outcome of a certain process, will encompass: 1) product; 2) service; and 3) software. This paper will demonstrate the methodology for setting and assessing user requirements, as well as identifying input elements, or factors influencing the satisfaction of these requirements. The multitude of factors affecting product realization and quality, along with meeting user requirements, complicates product quality management. Numerous alternative solutions exist for bettering product quality, each characterized by implementation costs and differing effects on product quality. While determining implementation costs for each option is straightforward, the challenge lies in ascertaining how a specific enhancement influences product quality and, indirectly, user satisfaction. The task at hand is selecting the optimal combination of quality-impacting factors within a limited budget. What will be the result of enhancing quality-impacting factors? To assess how improving these factors impacts a product’s compliance with user requirements, the compatibility of the final product will be simulated using Markov’s process, facilitated by the programming language Matlab. This paper significantly furthers the methodology of modeling and managing elements affecting product quality. A notable benefit of this study includes its practical implications for business systems focused on improving the processes that fulfill requirements. The findings can aid decision making about where to focus improvement efforts to elevate product quality. Keywords: quality, product quality, input elements, product quality influencers, quality enhancement, Markov’s processes, simulation of quality improvement effects.
