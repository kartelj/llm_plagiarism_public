Mobile phone use grows daily. Reviewing mobile history, it's clear that manufacturers have created increasingly sophisticated devices, aptly named smartphones. Their advanced capabilities and integration into our daily lives have lead to increased dependence on them. Smartphones are utilized for calls, web browsing, various services (like SMS, MMS, and email), and as cameras or GPS devices. Yet as mobile technology advances, security risk also rise, affecting the data transfer channels from sender to receiver. Security dangers for these devices grow larger, due to insufficient security mechanisms and protection tools. The usage of operating systems further complicates this issue. Every operating system provides benefits but also security vulnerabilities. As internet use via mobile devices grows, so do the risks associated with secure communication and establishing communication channels. Considering the extensive usage of mobile devices, discussing mobile communication security is essential. Open source projects offer developers extensive opportunities for creating unique solutions. Access to system source code has led to an operating system surpassing all others in the mobile phone market. The Android operating system, which operates on Java, has gained popularity among developers as an open platform that permits system-level modifications. Thus, developers can create unusual security measures based on the system kernel. Based on the Linux system, Android belongs to the Open Source Association. Seven years since inception, it has upgraded to version 7.0. This paper analyses Android's security mechanisms and identifies a low level security framework surrounding the system. A conducted survey highlights the lack of user mobile internet safety knowledge. In-depth exploration of Android's security mechanisms suggests a need for an improved security framework. Measures are proposed using the SE Linux for enhancing the security level. Differences between AOSP (Android Open Source Project) and the proposed SE Android (Security Enhanced) system were compared. The paper concludes with future work directions.
