Research on the interaction between humans and computers employs a method rooted in numerous scientific disciplines and fields, including computer science, psychology, sociology, cognitive sciences, design, and more. Modern interfaces that facilitate these interactions enable the use of diverse sensors such as a mouse, keyboard, gaze monitor (eyetracker), electroencephalography (EEG), pulse monitor, heart rate monitor, etc. This research focuses on human-computer interaction, specifically utilising artificial intelligence in the analysis and evaluation of respondent's cognitive functionality. With the ability to process data at a faster rate than humans, this system can provide immediate feedback to the user, thus actively participating in the interaction. The feasibility of creating an AI model to gather and scrutinize data from human-computer interaction was demonstrated using four cognitive performance tests - the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WSCT), Visual Short Term Working Memory Test (VSTWMT), mTutor Test, and the AC Test. Individual client applications were devised for each separate experiment with the capacity to connect with sensor applications through the Synchronization Platform (HCI-MAP). Data was collected through three sensors: an EEG device, eye tracking device, and a computer mouse. Independent sensor applications facilitated the data albeit and eventual joint processing, were devised to communicate with both EEG and eye tracking devices. Our research outcomes tied to participant performance on the computer version of WCS test revealed a variance from the norm in the categorisation achievement of our participants. Furthermore, the participants deviated significantly from the standards in attempts taken to attain the first category. Our participants' number of perseverative responses were below normal but there were no significant variations in set maintenance. Visual short-term memory (VSTM), or the ability to recall a small amount of visual information such as colors and shapes for a short length of time, is a component of short-term memory capable of retaining information for up to 30 seconds. The experiment was conducted in two measurement sessions. The first session was conducted in a secluded environment, and the second in the presence of an audience. EEG data classification was performed using four algorithms: Naive Bayes, Support Vector, KNN, and Random Forest, with a 90.12% and 90.51% accuracy rate in classifying the order and type of images displayed respectively. The electronic mTuror platform assessment aimed at finding an AI application model that as closely as possible, reflects the respondents' true knowledge. No strong correlation was found between any individual parameter and the accuracy of responses. However, the emotional state of respondents can be influenced with the insertion of a specific type of questions. Therefore, stress can be reduced with playful questions, interest levels can be raised with simple questions and focus can be regained with extremely difficult questions or those without a correct answer. The AC test measures the level of attention, or the ability to emphasize essential stimuli over distractions. A high level of correlation between the gaze position and mouse cursor position allows approximation of one sensor's interaction using data analyzed from the other. Comparing gaze data with mouse movement data revealed a high correlation, particularly for the letter coordinates that the participant crossed out. In conclusion, the research conducted suggests the capability of deploying artificial intelligence to analyze human-computer interaction. AI implementation could yield equally good, if not better, results than human analysis. A distributed solution can also be employed to synchronize and provide real-time system feedback. An AI-driven automated analysis has the capability of assessing the cognitive performance of users.
