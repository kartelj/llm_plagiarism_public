The doctoral thesis titled "Laser perception of defined objects, commands encapsulation and control elements for the modern robotized teaching tool" presents a utilitarian blueprint for creating modern robotic educational tools. The suggested kit includes beneficial components like laser recognition for determined objects on the robotic platform, multiple control modules, and experimental. The dissertation explores three primary domains: construction and design of the laser sensors group, creation and design of the programmable accompanying control module, logic controllers, and development and design of the self-propelled robotized platform. Each of these modules can function autonomously. When combined into a complete kit, they form an excellent foundation for experimentation.
