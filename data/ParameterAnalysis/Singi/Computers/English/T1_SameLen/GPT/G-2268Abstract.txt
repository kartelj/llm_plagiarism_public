The rising demand to enhance data-rate for transferred multimedia, coupled with stricter copyright protection needs in contemporary society, is increasingly evident. FSO communications, in this regard, offer a robust alternative to traditional wireless communication systems. Wherever feasible, these systems deliver ultra-high performance to users including transfer rates of multiple Gb and exceptionally secure options. Due to their cost-effective implementation, they are practical and pivotal in the 'last mile' connection. This study examines the potential for transmitting images via the FSO communication channel under scintillation. It investigates the transmission of copyright-protected data (watermarked images), and the influence of FSO channels on issues such as degradation, degradation or protection code, as well as color images to detect post-transmission fires over the FSO communication channel.
