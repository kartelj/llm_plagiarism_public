At the onset of the 21st century, Information Technologies (ITs) became crucial in education. A major challenge during this era involved acquisition of hardware and integration of IT into contemporary teaching methods. The amazing attributes of this technology are underutilized in numerous developing countries due to inadequate technical devices in schools and deficient teacher training for their use. A large proportion of schools depend on software that is proprietary to IT firms, who sell these products at exorbitant prices. The objective of this research is to introduce a novel perspective in the realm of information systems and education. Particularly, this research highlights the potential and influence of Open Source Software (OSS). This subject is of significant interest in professional circles, given Munich's decision to transition to OSS to save considerable resources. As of now, several European Union countries are contemplating a shift to OSS, while some have already begun this transition. This issue needs to be viewed from various facets such as economical, technological, pedagogical, sociological, cultural, legal aspects and so on. This article provides comparison between Microsoft Windows and Linux operating systems, which is a hot topic in the IT world with regards to their applicability and dominance. The technology rivalry between Open Source and proprietary software code is also examined, taking into account their roots and development philosophies. To substantiate the compatibility of these systems on the same hardware as their rivals, we performed tests that show the feasibility of both systems on identical hardware architectures.
