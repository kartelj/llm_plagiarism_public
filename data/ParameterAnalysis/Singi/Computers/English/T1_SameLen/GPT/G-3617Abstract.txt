Mobile devices have become a crucial element of our daily lives, a shift primarily fueled by social media and rapid news dissemination. However, a mere decade ago, mobile applications were solely designed for niche purposes. Furthermore, the functionality of those devices and apps fell vastly short of what exists today. This mobile evolution has prompted growth in related scientific fields previously unconnected, but have benefited from collaboration due to the development of mobile tech and applications. Notably, these include telecommunications, electronics, software engineering, and internet tech. Rapid advancements in these areas have enabled mobile devices to mimic the functionality of traditional PCs and continue to evolve. A key constraint is the device autonomy and power conservation. Given the current battery tech, achieving significant device autonomy remains elusive. Market demands urge swift processors, compact device dimensions (thickness), but also larger display sizes. Of significant importance also is mobile internet connectivity, without which mobile devices would lose functionality. Mobile device makers aim to maintain all these features while boosting energy efficiency and autonomy. Increasing device energy efficiency can be realized via hardware and software innovations. It is widely known that internet usage notably drains power, pointing to an area ripe for optimization. One potential solution lies in the prevailing mobile services model. Most mobile device apps operate based on a master-slave communication principle with various servers. Essentially, the app and server transfer substantial volumes of bi-directional data. Regardless of whether it's simple message reading, a weather forecasting app, a social network, or an online strategy. The app sends and receives intricate data structures. Nowadays, in the age of object-oriented programming languages, all these data can be treated as class instances lists and objects series. The process of compacting and decompressing intricate data structures into a byte-series suitable for transmission is referred to as data serialization. This paper explores the energy-efficient transmission of serialized data between servers and mobile devices. The researchers created a controlled environment primarily measuring power consumption during server communication. The gathered data was utilized to create a mathematical model incorporating functions, serving as parameters, which outlined the serialization time and serialized file size. This research data was then used for an experimental API-CBSaver, determining the most efficient serialization and compression method in real-time based on the mathematical models. The API-CBSaver testing results provide a roadmap on how to improve energy efficiency.
