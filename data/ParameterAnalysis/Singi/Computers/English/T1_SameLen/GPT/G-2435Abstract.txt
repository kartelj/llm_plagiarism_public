The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) introduced XML as a standard for web application use, transactions, documentation, database management, and information exchange over the Internet. XML enables the storage of diverse data, irrespective of its display method. It has been employed to create, revise, and query databases. Making and penning legible XML documents, for both humans and machines, are fairly simple, facilitating the development of applications for handling these documents. Virtually all types of data can be represented in XML documents. Arabic content and internet users have grown exponentially in recent years. With over 375 million speakers, approximately 40% of Arabic speakers use the Internet, accounting for nearly 5% of global internet users. The number of Arabic-speaking Internet users has surged sixty-fold from 2000 to 2015. This surge in usage has exceeded the growth of information retrieval systems, Arabic text summarization, query processes, and natural language processing. Arabic words come with diverse syntax and morphologies, each carrying different meanings. This linguistic diversity poses challenges in text processing, document summarization, and information retrieval systems, and sometimes leads to significant information loss. This thesis presents a RAX system for ranking Arabic documents during information retrieval, based on content similarity. The proposed model is applicable for documents in various formats written in Arabic. Considering the linguistic complexity, it follows a strictly statistical approach, and is based on existing text processing frameworks and Arabic grammar references. Our research mainly assesses the different similarity measures used for classifying Arabic documents from different domains based on user-provided query criteria. The associated security concerns of the RAX system will also be examined, including XML security, SOAP message, and countermeasures against security attacks.
