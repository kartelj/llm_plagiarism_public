This article focuses on the exploration of information extraction of various business documents in a desktop environment. A document expresses information through a number of modes, such as text, format/style and pictures. For instance, in a scholarly article, there are likely to be diagrams to demonstrate study findings, and the heading usually has a diverse font size to the main text. Indexing and retrieval solely relying on text is the conventional IR (Information Retrieval) method. But with the growth of the internet and Digital Libraries, the need to create IR methods for smart indexing and extraction of various mode documents is increasingly vital. Indexing and retrieval are two key components of an IR system. With a group of documents, indexing characterises these using an index language. Retrieval uses the results of indexing and finds relevant documents relating to a user's request. Text and image modes use differing indexing and retrieval techniques. Single-mode IR, either using text or pictures, has its drawbacks. Multimodal IR aims to surmount the obstacles in each single mode by merging them.
