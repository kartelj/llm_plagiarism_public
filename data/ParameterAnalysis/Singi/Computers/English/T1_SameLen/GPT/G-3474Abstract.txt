During the rapid growth phase of information technology, its substantial applications were seen in the education sector. Many education providers employed the DLS education platform as an addition to traditional learning methods. However, an increasing number of tertiary education institutions globally and domestically have implemented this form of instruction and instituted remote learning. This paper's purpose was to provide an overview of the contemporary status of quality DLS e-learning systems. The development of e-learning model models was examined alongside the proposal of potential future developments. The incorporation of learning management systems, intelligent tutoring systems, adaptive educational hypermedia systems in educating has paved the way for building an enormous database of student learning styles. Learning Management Systems (LMS) are used to design, organize, execute, manage online courses, training programs, independent of their unique location and timing. Moodle (Modular Object Dynamic Learning Environment) is one of the most widely used learning management systems. This open-source system utilizes a collection of PHP modules installed on the web server along with MySQL, Postgres databases. The focus was on enhancing student performance in the examination process and the technical elements of the e-learning system, ensuring its sustainable growth in response to swift developments in the application and establishment of information and communication technologies.
