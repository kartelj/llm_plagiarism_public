Government, military, police, and security agencies require the utmost security for their professional systems. They cannot depend on widely accessible protection systems nor on security systems developed outside the organization, which may be vulnerable due to known operational principles or design flaws. To ensuring premier communication protection, they must create their own robust systems, impervious to all known attack forms. The comprehensive creation of a communication system entails development at every stage, from user interface to infrastructure. This kind of development demands significant resources and investment, as well as adequate time for development, testing, and debugging. This paper explores the potential uses of public communication infrastructures and technologies in the development and operation of a system providing maximum communication security. It outlines the detailed development process and features of a solution that incorporates proprietary ciphers into the network communication layer.
