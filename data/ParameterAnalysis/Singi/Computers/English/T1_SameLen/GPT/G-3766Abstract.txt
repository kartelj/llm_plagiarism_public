This thesis aimed to evaluate the conditions of patients afflicted with neuro-motor diseases using healthcare sensor networks, and to determine if tennis could offer superior rehabilitation compared to conventional methods. Additionally, the objective was to validate that these sensor networks face heightened risks requiring vigilant monitoring. The thesis compares the recovery of two similar patients, one using standard rehabilitation, the other using tennis as a therapeutic activity. Furthermore, it also contrasts the progress of the whole group with a control group. The study also analyzes the healthcare sensor networks, their safeguarding, and secure deployment. The investigation's outcome confirmed that patients undergoing therapy via tennis recuperated more rapidly and effectively, concluding with superior strength in their strokes than patients following ordinary rehabilitation procedures. Therefore, the research's outcome was deemed successful. My additional hypothesis was also corroborated as the advancement of technology has resulted in increasingly prevalent security vulnerabilities in various networks.
