The methods of systems and processes, along with structural and object-oriented modelling, offer optimal outcomes in terms of design, development and ICT security practice. System security operations transform input into output and aim to enhance the value of the output parameters. These operations combine methods, tools and skilled, motivated individuals to carry out security duties. Security processes should be consistently monitored and upgraded, as typically, owners, management, and traditional users have limited security awareness. Furthermore, security technologies and professionals can be costly. Process-focused standards and models derived from the Capability Maturity Model (CMM), particularly the System Security Engineering Capability Maturity Model (SSE CMM), have been established to assess quality and track progress of process development and enhancement. When comparing the correlation of standards and models based on system, process or environment approaches, many potential frameworks for process evaluation and improvement emerge. Integrated process models like SSE CMM and CMMI offer a unified framework for assessment and improvement across varying processes. The SSE CMM consolidates SSE (11), project-management (5) and organizational (6) process regions. In the SSE CMM framework, process performance quality and maturity are measured using specific system and process centric metrics, based on essential (BP) and generic (GP) practice implementation and performance standards. The SSE CMM metric separates capability (CL) and maturity (ML) levels into five active tiers. The System Security Appraisal Method (SSAM), built on the SSE CMM model, is specifically designed to conduct verification type evaluations that not only identify but authenticate the objective data of the BP and GP practice performance and implementation. The experimental assessment of current ESS processes across three examined projects and a process enhancement plan proposal confirm the declared user acceptance and practicality of the SSE CMM model and the SSAM method for security process evaluation and improvement. This confirms their viability for optimal security programme development, security organization profiling, and numerous other ICT security applications.
