Culture's perpetuation contours society, with society being established through the advancement and refinement of culture and knowledge. Education serves as the conduit for societal evolution. Within the education ecosystem, the measurement of acquired knowledge and developed practical skills is crucial. Computer science, among the vast spectrum of natural and technical subjects, frequently relies on assessments to gauge students' practical aptitude. Multiple evaluation techniques are utilized in education, with continual efforts being made to enhance these methods to secure accurate and objective evaluation. Historical and current methods of assessment are documented in literature, with closed-ended questions and the assessment of practical work being prevalently used. Tests are helpful in determining cognitive understanding, while practical work reviews aid in surmising practical aptitude. These methods can be executed either manually or digitally. For automated forms, configurations need to be in place to enable their execution without examiners. Drawn from professional experience, unbiased and precise manual student evaluation is a challenging endeavor, irrespective of the method. Hence, automated assessments are recommended. However, applying these techniques to measure both knowledge and practical competencies is complex, given the incompatible nature of the methods for both these facets. This paper, through a literature survey, discusses the prevalent issues and emphasizes finding an accurate approach for practical skill evaluation in programming-focused subjects. Over the four-year study duration, two student generations were evaluated using two different solutions. One method entailed an electronic multiple-choice test to evaluate knowledge, with the other analyzing the accuracy of practical work. This paper addresses several research questions, the solutions to which were discovered by investigating the data gathered from these two assessment methods. Quantitative and qualitative research techniques were employed to analyze the collected data. Additionally, the paper presents case studies of the various assessment methodologies used for these evaluations and data collection within the research timeframe. These case studies elucidate the introduced evaluation tools. The paper explores the feasibility of developing automated tools to substitute examiners, comparing assessment results from both methods, validating the efficaciousness of tests in determining practical skills, and proposing a method to ensure examiner-impartial assessments. The paper also includes data analysis discussions and research outcomes. This research introduces a method to objectively and precisely evaluate practical competencies in programming-related computer science subjects at the undergraduate level, with solutions presented for achieving this end. Apart from its scientific relevance, this research also has practical implications.
