This paper introduces a unique method for cryptographically secure biometric identification that relies on public-key cryptography, a pseudo-random number generator, and cancelable biometrics. The biometric templates are kept encrypted or cancelable except during the feature extraction stage, providing protection against various attacks. The system also avoids demanding computational tasks, and the size of the biometric templates is appropriate. The proposed method for cryptographically secure identification is carried out using a component-based biometric system for mobile banking user confirmation, focusing on human eye iris biometrics. Both the effectiveness of the system and the randomness of the biometric templates and the data transmitted over the network in this usage scenario receive positive evaluations using realistic data.
