The PhD thesis, Posthuman Gaze: Automated Images in Contemporary Cinema, explores the concept of automated images as a form of expression in modern cinema through the lens of new cinematic methods in the digital media age. With ever-present moving digital images, the origin of the image is frequently obscure. From the cameras in our computers, the lenses of our gadgets, to surveillance systems, images are created automatically and algorithmically. The thesis will delve into how these seemingly arbitrary and autonomous images influence modern cinema. Therefore, cinema will be viewed as an artistic medium with inherent transdisciplinarity. The primary goal of the thesis is to investigate how the culture of post-cinema (where film creation and reception technologies are engulfed by strikingly different power dynamics) mirrors the relationship between the human subject and their societal, neoliberal, technocentric environment, closely tied to the posthumanist context. The introduction outlines the methodological foundation of the thesis, comprised of theoretical and empirical research formed through the review and analysis of the theoretical framework, and is based on an interdisciplinary approach to the subject. The first chapter lays out the theoretical approaches to the concept of automated image. The second chapter contextualizes the concept of automated image within posthuman studies, while the third chapter clarifies the terminological and structural basis for potential analysis of automated image as a film medium. The fourth, fifth, and sixth chapters handle specific case studies: analyses of automated images in modern cinema through reviews of surveillance camera films, computer screen films, and landscape films as emerging genres and film-making trends. Selected case studies suggest a general trend of deconstructing traditional film narrative styles by utilizing atypical film techniques to make the content more relevant to the demands of today's screen culture, necessitating a new understanding of contemporary scopic regimes. Hence, the thesis provides a critical tool for interpreting contemporary digital cinema's tendencies as a ramification of posthumanist discourse.
