Telecommunication signal transmission via electricity transmission lines began in the late 19th century. Traditional telecommunication technologies required considerable investment, leading to research and development into Power Line Communication (PLC) technology, primarily to manage automatic regulation in substations. As time passed, the PLC communication frequency within the CENELEC range (3 kHz - 148.5 kHz) standardised. This two-way narrowband PLC communication became widely utilised in remote electricity meter reading and consumption management. Thus, PLC technology became vital in the provision of communication services at the access level, directly to the electricity consumer or end user. Modern telecommunication technologies and services developed by telecommunication operators for their customers overlapped with the needs of these electricity users. This led electricity distribution companies and PLC equipment manufacturers to invest in Broadband PLC communication over the past 15 years. Broadband PLC uses a frequency band from 1.6 MHz - 30 MHz and supports high data rates up to 200 Mbps for broadband services like VoIP, VoD, and high-speed internet. This enabled electricity distribution companies to diversify their services, become more competitive in the liberalized electricity market and expand their business. This document covers Broadband Power Line Communication (BPL) commercialization challenges, technical solutions, a specific project proposal, and success indicator evaluation. It's divided into ten chapters. After an introductory chapter, the second chapter details the various power line types used for communication services, highlighting each's unique characteristics. The third part covers PLC system elements and how they affect PLC communication performance. The fourth chapter addresses the impact of electricity network topology changes on PLC networks and the organization of PLC access networks. Chapter five discusses the types of interference in low voltage and medium voltage networks. The sixth section covers telecommunication traffic's modulation techniques and switching techniques within the PLC system. The seventh chapter discusses multimedia content transmission via the access broadband PLC network and their quality requirements. Chapter eight highlights the related regulatory issues. The ninth chapter proposes a project to evaluate BPL applicability in the Republic of Serbia. Chapter ten concludes the document.
