Given that our world houses over 7 billion people, and the projected population increase to approximately 9 billion by 2050, identifying individuals while preserving their privacy is a significant issue. Multiple governments and security-related agencies, considering the collective security aspect, have pertinent need for biometric identification. Private companies also participate in the evolution of biometric identification technology, exploring its profitability previously exclusive to government. Despite economic hurdles, the US has prioritized and heavily invested in enhanced biometric identification since the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Similarly, China, the most populous country, also made substantial strides in developing individual biometric identification mechanisms. Meanwhile, India's biometric identification technology implementation is driven not by security, but by addressing food distribution. The European Union, led by the Netherlands, invests significant efforts in biometric identification techniques. Biometric data privacy ultimately depends on the organization's practices and privacy policies gathering and storing that data, and the security methods applied. However, even these organizations deemed 'trustworthy' aren't immune to data infringements. Security-privacy balance is researched globally, with evolving approaches over the past decades, furthered by IT development. Noteworthy is that biometric data's inconsistent representation or "noise" means traditional classical logic application isn't feasible. Additionally, cryptographic procedures using biometric data are unviable given their non-compliance to required cryptography criteria. Fuzzy logic offers a fresh approach, more human-like, explored in some biometric identification solutions, extracting cryptographic keys from biometric data via fuzzy extractor function. Other techniques propose unique cryptographic key creation, then merging with biometric data. A range of proposed solutions also employ different error correcting methods, compensating the variability of biometric data. For storage mediums, the microcontroller-embedded polycarbonate card is a common solution. While these solutions display various pros and cons, fuzzy sketch solutions have biometric feature visibility during decoding as their main disadvantage. Whereas; cryptographic key independent creation and merging with biometric data methods yield improved results. Suitable employment of error correction methods mostly produce favorable outcomes. Some solutions using iris as biometric data demonstrate correct results, but are inefficient for fingerprint processing owing to their binary nature differences. The solution proposed in this paper uses fingerprints as biometric data. Post minutiae or unique fingerprint point identification, two independent templates are constructed; one for the identification procedure, the other combines biometric data with a pre-constructed cryptographic key subjected to error correction encoding via Slepian Wolf encoding. Both templates are stored in a token device, like a microprocessor embedded card. The initial identification phase confirms if fingerprint is identical. Following positive identification, the cryptographic key is separated from the fingerprint, with the Slepian Wolf encoding reapplied for error correction while the deciphered key undergoes standard cryptographic operations. The proposed solution significantly minimizes identification errors and enhances cryptographic key reconstruction, with the original fingerprint image concealed throughout the procedure, ultimately improving security. This outlined treatment resists multiple potential attack scenarios intending to compromise biometric data or personal identity.
