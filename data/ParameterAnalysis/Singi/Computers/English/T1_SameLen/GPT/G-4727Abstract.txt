This PhD thesis proposes a unique fingerprint biometric encryption system using the fuzzy commitment scheme and deep convolutional neural networks. The key innovation in this paper is a new method for automatic fingerprint texture descriptor discretization, completely relying on a convolutional neural network and intended to create fixed-length patterns. The proposed two-bit coding quantization of the harvested features converts biometric patterns into a binary domain. This enables the usage of XOR biometrics and the creation of a biometric encryption system that can function for key-release or as a safeguarding mechanism in fingerprint recognition systems. The variability of biometric data is minimized by utilizing secure block-level Bose–Chaudhuri–Hocquenghem error correcting codes that resist statistical-based attacks. The suggested biometric encryption can handle a 265-bit key length, fulfilling the needs of contemporary cryptographic systems, with a tolerable EER of 1%. Evaluation reveals considerable performance advantages compared to other fingerprint matching and biometric encryption systems based on texture.
