The doctoral thesis centers on examining contemporary problems connected to cryptographic key exchange and user authentication in a covert communication system. The dissertation analyses existing solutions in this research area and the development of a proprietary encrypted communication system. The scholarly objective is to enhance the electronic identification (eID) based protocol for cryptographic key exchange. A review of existing strategies was conducted to bolster secret communication defense levels and lay groundwork for a proprietary system. By integrating cryptography methods that ensure privacy, authenticity, and integrity, along with steganographic techniques for covert information swap, the suggested system's users can transmit secret messages efficiently and safely. By scrutinizing the research outcomes, it is concluded that the secret usage of cryptographic keys for communication is justified due to electronic identification.
