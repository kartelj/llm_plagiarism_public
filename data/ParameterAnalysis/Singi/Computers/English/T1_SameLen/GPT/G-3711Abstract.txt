The Distance Learning System (DLS) is a modern method of education rapidly gaining a global audience. The DLS concept relies on tutoring systems and their modules (e.g., assistant modules, tutor modules, emotion tracking and recognition modules, motivation modules, etc.) that work in coordination with system feedback. The modularity of the DLS is beneficial primarily for adjustments, adaptability, automation, and DLS self-correction. This unique DLS framework has promoted easy implementation, widespread availability, and increased efficiency of contemporary Learning Management Systems (LMS). LMSs are utilized to create, manage, deliver, administer, and validate classes in the context of educational environments. Determining educational settings and class preparation begins with identifying student attributes, student groupings, and their division based on predispositions, prior knowledge, and inclinations. Essentially, an understanding of each student's traits, inclinations, and abilities is imperative. Enrolling in classes, during classes, and especially when faced with challenging math problems, inevitable misunderstandings and ambiguities will arise. This leads to a range of emotional responses, distractions, concentration lapses, and motivation decreases. This is when the DLS and its modules indicate discrepancies and an unequal quality of study that no longer aligns with every student's individual needs. The correction function module should address this issue. Therefore, it's vital to identify student traits and significant educational environment factors. Each individual or student group should be allocated an appropriate combination of DLS modules to facilitate successful class tracking and quality assessment at the course's end. All these diverse factors defining educational settings must be specified with weighting coefficients due to possible impacts. Looking back, it's important to devise mathematical modules based on two informational types to ascertain appropriate grades for every DLS program student. The first type of information considers the grade point average, grades for related subjects earned previously, the student's motivation level, etc. The second type of information relates to students' emotional responses to class tasks and assignments meant to facilitate course material mastery. Besides, it's necessary to formulate mathematical models incorporating multiple-criteria grading of certain DLS study platforms with the sole objective of linking particular situations with the teaching procedure in all students' and student groups' best interests. On occasion, it's untenable to use this multiple-criteria grading method due to its inherent structure. Therefore, while working, to achieve the optimal results, a specific grading method is designed for each particular case, namely, the educational environment.
