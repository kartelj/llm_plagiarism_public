The objective of this thesis was both to assess the conditions of patients suffering from neuro-motor illnesses with the help of networks of sensors used in health care, and to see if tennis as a sport is better at rehabilitating than the regular reeducational processes. Another goal was to prove that these networks of sensors are exposed to increasing dangers that is a major factor to keep an eye on. In the thesis the improvement and recovery of two patients of nearly the same age, strength and physique are compared, one of whom is recovering with a regular rehabilitation while the other one with the means of tennis as a rehabilitating sport. Besides, the development of the entire group is also compared with that of the control group. Moreover, the networks of sensors used in health care, their protection and safe installation are also analysed. As the result of the research, it is proved, that the patients cured with the help of tennis improved faster and better, by the end of the research their stroke power was stronger, than that of the patients undergoing the regular rehabilitating processes. So, we can declare, that the result of the research was a success. The other assumption of mine was also supported, since with the development of technology, the various safety gaps are more and more common in the different networks.
