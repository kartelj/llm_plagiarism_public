At the beginning of the 21st century, ITs became an indispensable part of education. One of the main problems in this period was the acquisition of equipment and implementation of information technology into modern education. Great features of this technology are underused in many developing countries, and one of the main reasons was insufficient technical equipment in schools, and insufficient training of teachers for their application. The vast majority of schools use software that fall into proprietary software of IT companies, who charge these products at high prices. The aim of this study is to present a new point of research in the field of information systems and education. In particular, this study draws attention to the opportunities and impact of Open Source Software (OSS). This topic is very relevant in professional circles, since the city of Munich decided to switch to OSS in order to save a considerable funds. Now some of the countries of the EU are considering switching their computer systems on OSS, and there are also those who have already made their first steps in this direction. This topic should be considered from different aspects, such as economic, technological, pedagogical, sociological, cultural, legal aspects and etc. In this paper it is presented comparisons made between Microsoft Windows and Linux operating systems which is the actual topic in the world of IT when it comes to their applicability and superiority. Also it is scrutinize technological competition between Open Source and proprietary software code taking into account their origin and philosophy of development. In proving the applicability of these systems on the same hardware as the other competitors, we did the tests that indicate the possibility of both systems on the same hardware architectures.
