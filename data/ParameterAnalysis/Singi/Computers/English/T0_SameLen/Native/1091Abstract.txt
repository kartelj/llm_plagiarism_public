Professional systems used by government, military, police, security agencies, etc require highest possible level of communication protection. Those systems cannot rely on publicly available protection systems. Also, they cannot rely on security systems which has not been developed within organization and whose principles of operation or possible flaws in design and implementation are known outside the organization. In the course of achieving highest level of communication protection, professional systems have to develop protection systems of their own, which will be resistant to all known types of attacks. Complete development of communication system implies component development on every level - from user interface to communication infrastructure. That kind of development requires vast resources and investments, as well as proper time for development, testing and debugging. In this paper are discussed utilization possibilities of available public communication infrastructures and technologies for development and usage of system which offers highest possible level of communication protection. Within the paper is presented detailed development process and characteristics of solution based on integrating own ciphers on network communication layer.
