The subject of the doctoral dissertation is looking at current issues related to the concepts of cryptographic key exchange and authentication of users of a secret communication system. The paper deals with the analysis of the existing solutions in the field of research and development of own secret communication system. The scientific goal of the dissertation is to improve the protocol for exchanging cryptographic keys based on electronic identification (eID). Analysis of the existing approaches in the research was carried out in order to improve the level of protection during secret communication and to provide the basis for the development of own system. By combining cryptographic methods that ensure confidentiality, authenticity and integrity, along with the use of steganographic methods for information exchange in a secret way, users of the proposed system are given the opportunity to exchange secret messages in an efficient and secure manner. By analysing the research findings, it has been concluded that it is justified to use in secret for exchanging cryptographic keys used identification electronic communication.
