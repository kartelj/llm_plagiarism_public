This thesis suggests a system category for creating and disseminating cryptographic keys, relying on multiple biometric methods. The theoretical structure includes two biometric methods, namely the fingerprint and the iris. During operational modes, the system utilizes hash values acquired during the initial stage, or the enrollment stage. Alongside these values, supplementary data are employed to render biometric data revocable, thereby safeguarding the privacy of such data. Moreover, they offer protection for cryptographic parameters. Iris biometrics, holding the most bio-information, was utilized for secret key extraction, while fingerprints were used for verification purposes. The experimental evaluation, covering the thesis's entire research aspect, is grounded on samples from the CASIA biometric database. The experimental outcomes demonstrate significant advancements that substantially enhance the performance of this system category.
