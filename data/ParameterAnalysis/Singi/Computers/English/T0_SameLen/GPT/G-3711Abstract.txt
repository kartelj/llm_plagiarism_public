The Distance Learning System (DLS) is a contemporary educational concept that is quickly becoming universally accepted. The DLS is based on various tutoring systems and modules (assistant module, tutor module, modules for tracking and recognizing emotions, motivational modules, etc.) that work in conjunction with feedback from the system. The modular nature of the DLS is crucial for its corrective roles, adaptability, automation process, and self-adaptation. This innovative DLS concept has facilitated the easy introduction, widespread presence, and enhanced functionality of modern Learning Management Systems (LMS). LMS are utilized for creating, organizing, implementing, administering, and verifying classes in relation to educational environments. Defining educational environments and preparing for classes begins with identifying the qualities of students, student groups, and categorizing them based on their predispositions, prior knowledge, and orientation. It is essential to understand the characteristics, tendencies, and abilities of each student as an individual. During class enrollment, in-class sessions, and particularly when faced with challenging mathematical problems, misunderstandings and ambiguities will arise. This can result in a range of emotions, inattentiveness, concentration lapses, and motivation drops. At this point, the DLS and its modules signal any irregularities and a decline in study quality that no longer meets the individual needs of each student. The corrective functions module should address this issue. Hence, it is vital to identify student characteristics and valid educational environment factors from the outset. In this regard, each individual student or student group must be assigned an appropriate combination of DLS modules to successfully keep up with classes and provide a quality assessment at the end of the course. All these varying factors that define educational environments must be specified with weighting coefficients due to their consequential effects. Looking back, it is essential to develop mathematical modules based on two types of information that will provide an appropriate grade for each student participating in the distance learning program. The first type of information represents input information that considers grade point average, grades from similar subjects obtained during the previous educational stage, the student's level of motivation, etc. The second type of information is based on the emotional reactions students display when faced with tasks and assignments as part of their classes, which are solely designed to master the course material. In addition to this, it is necessary to create mathematical models that include multi-criteria grading of certain DLS study platforms, all with the aim of correlating specific situations with the teaching process, all in the best interest of each individual student or student groups. Sometimes, it is not possible to simply apply this multi-criteria grading method due to the structure of the method itself. Therefore, while working, a specific grading method is created for each unique case, i.e., educational environment, to achieve the best possible results.
