Mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) are self-organizing networks of nodes linked wirelessly without any centralized control. These networks are currently a significant research topic due to their wide range of applications (military, emergency, etc.). In MANETs, each node functions as both a host and a router, meaning it must be able to forward packets to other nodes. The mobility of the nodes causes frequent changes in these networks' topologies. To address these issues, specific routing protocols for MANETs are required. Conventional routing protocols used in wired networks are not efficient in MANETs. This thesis aims to investigate the current state of the art of existing routing protocols for MANETs and compare various methods. There are three primary classes of routing protocols for MANETs: reactive, proactive, and hybrid. By examining the pros and cons of each, a new routing protocol is suggested. The new system, named OLSR-BF, is a proactive routing protocol primarily based on the existing OLSR routing protocol. The modification made to the new routing protocol primarily involves the use of the Bellman-Ford algorithm to determine the shortest distance between nodes within a MANET network. To validate the design and performance of the new routing protocol, it is qualitatively compared with existing AODV, DSDV, and OLSR routing protocols.
