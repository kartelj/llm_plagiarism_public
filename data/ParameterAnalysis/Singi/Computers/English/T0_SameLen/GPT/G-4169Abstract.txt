Currently, numerous swarm intelligence algorithms are effectively utilized to tackle a variety of complex optimization issues. These algorithms all share common features, such as the local search operator (exploitation) that focuses on promising solutions that have been discovered, and the global search operator (exploration) that aids in avoiding local optima. Swarm intelligence algorithms are typically first tested on unconstrained, constrained, or high-dimensional standard test function sets. They can also be enhanced, adapted, modified, hybridized, and integrated with local search. The ultimate goal is to apply these metaheuristics to real-world optimization problems. The solution domains or search spaces for practical complex optimization problems can vary. Solutions can be real or integer number vectors, but they can also be more intricate structures. Swarm intelligence algorithms must be adapted for different search spaces, which could involve a simple adjustment of algorithm parameters or adaptation for integer solutions by merely rounding the obtained real solutions. However, for some search spaces, the algorithm needs to be almost entirely restructured, including exploitation and exploration operators, retaining only the guiding process or swarm intelligence. This dissertation presents several swarm intelligence algorithms and their adaptations for different search spaces and their application to practical problems. The dissertation's objectives are to analyze and adapt swarm intelligence algorithms based on the fitness function and search space. The dissertation topic includes a thorough review of existing swarm intelligence algorithm implementations. The dissertation also includes a comparative analysis, presentation of the weaknesses and strengths of some algorithms compared to others, along with research on the adaptation of swarm intelligence algorithms for different search spaces and their application to practical problems. Problems with real solutions such as support vector machine optimization, clustering, with integer solutions such as digital image segmentation problems, and problems where solutions have a special structure such as robot path planning and minimum weight triangulation are considered. Modified and adapted swarm intelligence algorithms for different search spaces and applied to practical problems were tested on standard test data sets and compared with other contemporary methods from the literature for solving the considered problems. Successful adaptations of swarm intelligence algorithms for various search spaces are demonstrated. These adapted algorithms achieved superior results in all cases compared to the methods from the literature, leading to the conclusion that it is possible to adapt swarm intelligence algorithms for various search spaces, including complex structures, and achieve superior results compared to methods from the literature.
