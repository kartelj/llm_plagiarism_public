The W3C suggested XML as a standard for use in web applications, transactions, documentations, database management systems, and for exchanging information over the Internet. XML permits the storage of various data, irrespective of its display method. XML is utilized to create, update, and query databases. The creation and writing of clear, human-readable XML documents, as well as machine-readable ones, are simple, making it easy to develop applications that process these XML documents. Generally, all types of information can be represented as XML documents. In recent years, there has been a significant increase in Arabic content and user numbers on the Internet. Arabic is a widely spoken language, with over 375 million speakers, and more than 155 million, or over forty percent of these Arabic-speaking individuals, use the Internet. This accounts for nearly five percent of all Internet users globally. The number of Arabic-speaking Internet users has increased sixty-fold in the past fifteen years (2000- 2015). This usage growth has surpassed the growth in information retrieval systems, Arabic text summarization (such as documents and web pages), query processes, and natural language processors. The Arabic word has various syntax and morphology forms with different meanings. Grammatically, documents contain various word forms, including derivations. This leads to issues in text processing, document summarization, and information retrieval systems. Moreover, there is a significant information loss during the querying, document summarizing, and information retrieval processes, especially with large documents, as information loss is directly proportional to the document size during these processes. This thesis outlines an RAX System designed for ranking Arabic documents in information retrieval processes. The proposed solution primarily relies on textual content similarity. The model we designed can be used for documents stored in various formats and written in Arabic. Due to the complex linguistic semantics of this language, the proposed solution employs a purely statistical approach. The design and implementation are based on existing text processing frameworks and Arabic grammar references. Our research's main focus has been evaluating different similarity measures used for classifying Arabic documents from various domains and document categories based on user-provided query criteria. Additionally, the thesis will examine the RAX system's security issues. These issues combine XML security (XML digital signature and XML encryption) and the SOAP message to create a secure environment between an end user and the RAX system model, as well as study the security attacks and countermeasures.
