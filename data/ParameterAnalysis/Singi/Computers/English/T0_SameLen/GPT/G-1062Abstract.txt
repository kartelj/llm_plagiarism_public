The dissertation's focus is on investigating e-business systems interoperability models from various viewpoints, grounded on service-oriented software development. The research examined: standards, interoperability frameworks and enterprise information systems architecture, ontologies-based semantic technologies, and service orientation. By assessing the present situation, best practices, and trends, the dissertation aids in addressing interoperability issues by introducing: a methodological framework for ad-hoc connection of e-business systems, a universal meta model for ensuring semantic consistency of the system and the description and discovery of components in e-business systems; a service-oriented architecture model for semantic interoperability of business processes on an ad-hoc basis. The research's validation was achieved by establishing interoperability and enhancing business process execution in the cultural heritage protection sectors. The results obtained have enhanced the utilization of available information, documents, and illustrative material related to various types of cultural artifacts.
