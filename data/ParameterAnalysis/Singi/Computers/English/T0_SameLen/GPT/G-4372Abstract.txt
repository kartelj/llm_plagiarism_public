Modern businesses grapple daily with information and data overload, complicating their operations and decision-making processes. It's crucial for these companies to effectively implement management knowledge to enhance their business activities. Additionally, safeguarding access to organizational memory (company knowledge), its trade and management, is a new focus area. The application of management intelligence, to manage organizational memory, is becoming an essential part of successful business strategies. Integrated automated organizational memory management, despite its complexity, offers a solution for the interplay between knowledge management and information technology. This makes it easier for a company to elucidate its decision-making process, as well as manage documentation, information, and data flow. The integrated automated memory management system provides the company with detailed data, facilitating concrete business decision-making. However, protecting such an integrated automated process is crucial. In line with international standards (ISO 27001), management in such systems should establish a model for implementing, handling, monitoring, reviewing, maintaining, and improving the organization's memory security management system. The protection and security of the organization's memory through a cryptographic solution should balance user requirements, functionality within the organization's memory, and the need to protect sensitive data and maintain their integrity. This integrated automated process of organizational memory management could be useful in learning intelligent systems and modern business decision-making systems. Digital signing would ensure document indisputability and immutability, which the proposed cryptographic solutions provide in line with current legal regulations for electronic documents. This paper proposes protecting the integrated system for organizational memory management by recording them in encrypted form, making the data accessible only through the company's information system. The paper will present the organization's unique cryptographic solution for memory protection from a knowledge management perspective. Document and data access would be granted only to explicitly authorized system users through the access to permission management system. Digital signing would ensure document indisputability and immutability, which the proposed cryptographic solutions provide in line with current legal regulations for electronic documents. The discussion will cover principles and models that provide data protection and privileged data access, all aimed at decision-making based on the organization's memory. Security information agencies serve as the best examples for such an analysis, with numerous examples of both successful organizations and oversights in their operations.
