In order to ensure information security within the digital realm, it's crucial to establish cryptographic algorithms that provide robust data and communication protection, accommodate extremely high communication speeds, demand minimal processing resources, and possess a highly compact implementation. These features suggest a category of sequential cryptographic algorithms, namely the creation of pseudorandom generators with the previously mentioned features. Considering these prerequisites, the objective of this study is to create a category of dependable and efficient pseudorandom generators. A category of random processes based on variable permutations is established and the probabilistic and statistical attributes of the established category of random processes are examined. The established category of random processes acted as a benchmark for establishing the category of pseudorandom generators parameterized with two pseudorandom sequences. Utilizing probability theory, information theory, and number theory, the attributes of an established category of pseudorandom generators are examined. Adequate conditions under which the output sequence of the established category of pseudorandom generators has an asymptotically uniform distribution of output symbols are deduced. Correlation analysis revealed that the elements of the parameterizing sequences and the output sequence are asymptotically independent and as a result, the information that the element of the output sequence conveys about the current internal state of the generator is asymptotically zero. Analysis of the output sequence period demonstrated that when the parameterizing sequences are chosen correctly, the period of the generated output sequence becomes significantly larger than the period of the parameterizing sequences. These attributes are the essential characteristics of cryptographic pseudorandom generators. The efficiency of the proposed structure is achieved by its compactness and selection of efficient pseudo randomly generated parametrizing sequences, for instance sequences generated by multiple linear shift registers. The potential applications of the proposed category of reliable pseudorandom generators are enumerated.
