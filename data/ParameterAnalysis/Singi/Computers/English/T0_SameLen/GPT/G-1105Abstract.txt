This PhD thesis, entitled "Laser perception of defined objects, commands encapsulation and control elements for the modern robotized teaching tool," proposes a practical framework for the advancement of contemporary robotized educational tools. The proposed kit includes versatile elements like the application of lasers for recognizing objects on the robotized platform, multi-control modules, and experimental dissertation. The focus is on three aspects: the design and creation of the laser sensor group, the design and creation of a programmable control module, logic controllers, and the design and creation of a self-propelled robotized platform. These modules can function independently. When combined into a complete kit, they provide an excellent foundation for experiments.
