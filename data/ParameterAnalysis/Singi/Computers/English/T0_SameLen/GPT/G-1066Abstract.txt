The interplay between supply and demand is heavily influenced by the marketing strategies of hotel businesses. This paper focuses on Serbian hotels, which vary greatly in their amenities and services, both internally and in comparison to international competitors. Recent investments in hotel infrastructure have transformed 4 and 5 star Serbian hotels, showcasing them in a fresh, contemporary light with stylish surroundings and up-to-date facilities. This paper will examine the current standing of 4 and 5 star hotels on the social media platform Facebook, and assess the prevalence and significance of Internet Distribution Systems (IDS) in sales, as well as their effect on the standard of hotel services. We will highlight the transformations in the hotel sector brought about by the introduction of IDS and the connection between these systems and the Serbian hotel industry. Two empirical studies were conducted, with participants being mid and top-tier management and guests who have stayed in the hotels under study. The gathered data was scrutinized using IBM SPSS Statistics 22 software, employing descriptive statistics, Student's t test, chi square test, Importance Performance Analysis and Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). Secondary data for the promotional study was analyzed using Simply Measured tools.
