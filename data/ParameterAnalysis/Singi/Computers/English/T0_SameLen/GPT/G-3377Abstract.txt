Electricity transmission lines have been used for telecommunication signal transmission since the late 19th century. Due to the high investment in traditional telecommunication technologies, the concept of transmitting telecommunication signals, mainly for automatic regulation management in substations, sparked the research and development of Power Line Communication (PLC). Over time, the frequency band for PLC communication in the CENELEC range (3 kHz to 148.5 kHz) has been standardized, and this narrowband two-way PLC communication has been widely used in remote electricity meter reading and consumption management. Hence, PLC technology is utilized for communication services at the access level, or directly to the end user - the electricity consumers. Meanwhile, a variety of modern telecommunication technologies and services provided by telecommunication operators to their customers have been developed. These users are also electricity consumers, provided by electricity distribution companies. Therefore, over the past 15 years, electricity distribution companies and PLC equipment manufacturers have recognized their interest by investing in the development of Broadband PLC communications, which uses the frequency band from 1.6 MHz to 30 MHz, allowing for higher data rates (theoretically up to 200 Mbps) to support broadband services such as VoIP, VoD, and high-speed Internet. By expanding their business in this direction, electricity distribution companies diversify their services and become more competitive in the liberalized electricity market. This paper provides an overview of the challenges and constraints faced before the final commercialization of Broadband PLC Communication (BPL), as well as proposed technical solutions to overcome these challenges and constraints. It also presents a specific project proposal and evaluation of indicators that would form the basis for verifying the applicability of BPL technology for the implementation of the access telecommunication level and the provision of broadband services to end-users. The paper is structured in 10 chapters. After the introductory first chapter, which describes the research subject, the motivation for the selection of the current topic, research goals, tasks, and the expected contribution from the research results, the second chapter provides a detailed overview of the types of power lines that can be found in use and their characteristics in terms of providing telecommunication services. There are different types of electric power conductors that are being implemented, both underground and above ground networks. Since low-voltage power lines are not primarily designed for telecommunication traffic transmission, their design and technical characteristics are not optimal for transmitting this type of signal, each type of conductor, so its application in terms of the type of conductor, its length, branching, etc., represents a unique model of BPL channel in some way, with its specific characteristics. The third section provides an overview of the PLC system elements and a theoretical analysis of the characteristics and impacts of each of its elements on the performance of PLC communication. Considering that the topology of the electricity network significantly influences the topology of the PLC network that is being implemented on the electricity network infrastructure, the fourth chapter presents the classification of different topologies of low-voltage electricity distribution networks through the description of the organization of PLC access networks in terms of the methodology for selecting the optimal location for installing a PLC base station, segmentation of the PLC access network, as well as the cases when it is necessary to use the regenerators of PLC signal and gateway in the PLC network. There is a significant number of different noise on the electricity network that affect PLC, or BPL communication. The fifth chapter categorizes and specifies the types of interference that occur in low voltage and medium voltage networks. Also, within this chapter, modulation techniques have been introduced which have found application in PLC systems, each with its advantages and disadvantages, with a proposal and description of OFDM modulation as optimal modulation for PLC communication. In addition to modulation techniques, it is necessary to observe the techniques of switching of telecommunication traffic within the PLC system, as well as to identify an efficient MAC protocol for application in the PLC access network. This is described in Chapter 6. Each of the conventional MAC protocols has its advantages and disadvantages for reliable application in PLC systems, so a concept of hybrid MAC protocol that would be suitable for application in the PLC network and for implementation is proposed by considering possible scenarios of capacity allocation and access to the PLC access network on the side of communication nodes, as well as on the side of end-users. Each of the targeted broadband telecommunication services aimed to be provided to the users within an access broadband PLC network have their own requirements regarding the quality of the service to be provided in order to be competitive in relation to the conventional telecommunication technologies. The seventh chapter describes the types of multimedia content that are envisaged for transmission over the access broadband PLC network, as well as the quality requirements (QoS) for each of the multimedia content. The BPL communication has its own limitations, both, technical as mentioned in the previous chapters, as well as the regulatory ones. BPL communication interferes with other telecommunication systems using the same frequency spectrum, which is especially expressed in the case of overhead power lines that act as antennas and radiate the signal into the environment. Chapter 8 presents the regulatory aspect of the implementation of BPL technology and systems, globally, and through the regulatory framework in the Republic of Serbia. In the ninth chapter, a Project is proposed to identify indicators that would be the basis for verifying the applicability of BPL technology for the implementation of the access telecommunication level and the provision of broadband services to the end- users in the Republic of Serbia. The last, tenth chapter is a systematic conclusion.
