We observe that mobile devices have become an integral part of our daily lives, largely due to social media and rapid news circulation. However, a decade ago, mobile apps were created solely for specific uses. Additionally, the operational capabilities of these devices and apps were significantly inferior to current ones. This evolution of mobile devices has spurred the growth of scientific fields that seemed unrelated, but have found synergy through the advancement of mobile devices and their applications. This primarily refers to telecommunications, electronics, software engineering, and internet technology. Rapid advancements in these fields have allowed mobile devices to match the functionality of traditional PCs and continue to progress. A key constraint is the device's autonomy and energy independence. In other words, with current battery technology, significant device autonomy is unattainable. The market demands fast processors, thinner devices, and larger screens. Also, mobile internet functionality is crucial for the usability of mobile devices. A goal for mobile device manufacturers is to maintain these features while increasing energy efficiency and autonomy. This can be achieved through hardware and software innovations. It's well known that internet usage is a major power drain, suggesting this area is ripe for optimization. One solution lies in the current mobile services model. Most mobile device apps operate on a master-slave communication principle with various servers. In other words, the app and server exchange large amounts of data. Whether it's simple message reading, weather forecasting apps, social networks, or online strategies, the app sends and receives complex data structures. In the current era of object-oriented programming languages, all this data can be treated as lists and series of class instances, or objects. The process of packing and unpacking complex data structures into a byte series suitable for sending is called data serialization. This paper presents research into energy-efficient serialized data transmission between servers and mobile devices. A test environment was established where the researchers primarily measured power consumption during server communication. The measurements were used to create a mathematical model, later populated with functions representing serialization time and serialized file size. The data collected was used to develop an experimental API-CBSaver, which uses mathematical models to choose the most efficient serialization and compression method in real time. The results from the API-CBSaver test suggest a direction for improving energy efficiency.
