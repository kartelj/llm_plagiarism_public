This study introduces a unique method for cryptographically secure biometric authentication, utilizing public key cryptography, a pseudo-random number generator, and cancelable biometrics. The biometric templates are either encrypted or cancelable throughout the system's operation, except during the feature extraction phase, providing security against various attacks. Moreover, the system doesn't require extensive computational resources, and the biometric templates' size is reasonable. The suggested method for cryptographically secure authentication is applied via a modular biometric system for mobile banking user verification, relying on human eye iris biometrics. Both the system's efficiency and the randomness of the biometric templates and the data transmitted over the network in this usage scenario receive positive evaluations based on realistic data.
