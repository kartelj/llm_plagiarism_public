The doctoral thesis titled Posthuman Gaze: Automated Images in Contemporary Cinema focuses on the exploration of automated images as a form of expression in modern cinema, viewed through the lens of new cinematic modes in the digital media era. In a time where digital moving images are everywhere, the origin of the image is often unclear. Whether from our computer cameras, our devices' lenses, or surveillance systems, images are created automatically and algorithmically. The thesis will investigate how these seemingly random and autonomous images influence modern cinema. Thus, cinema will be viewed as an artistic medium with inherent transdisciplinarity. In this context, the primary objective of the thesis is to explore how postcinematic culture (where film production and reception technologies are absorbed into drastically different power dynamics) mirrors the relationship between the human subject and his societal, neoliberal, technocentric environment, closely tied to the posthumanist context. The introduction lays out the methodological groundwork of the thesis, which includes theoretical and empirical research, formed through the review and analysis of the theoretical framework, and is grounded in an interdisciplinary approach to the subject. The first chapter lays the groundwork for theoretical approaches to the concept of automated image. In the second chapter, the concept of automated image is contextualized within posthumanist studies, while the third chapter provides the terminological and structural foundation for potential analysis of automated image as a film medium. The fourth, fifth, and sixth chapters tackle specific case studies, i.e., analysis of automated images in modern cinema, through reviews of surveillance camera films, computer screen films, and landscape films, as emerging genres and filmmaking trends. Chosen case studies suggest a common trend to deconstruct the traditional film narrative style by using unconventional film methods to align the content with the currents of contemporary screen culture, which necessitates a new understanding of modern scopic regimes. Hence, the thesis provides a critical tool for understanding the trends of modern digital cinema as a result of posthumanist discourse.
