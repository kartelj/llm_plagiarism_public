The issue of stock-outs is a major concern in the retail sector, as it directly results in lost sales, decreased profits, and potential customer loss. The stock-out rate is largely influenced by the business practices of retail chains and can vary significantly due to numerous factors, with the global average ranging between 5 - 10%. This high stock-out rate can result in an average financial loss of 4% of the total turnover of the retail chain. This study aimed to explore all relevant factors that could increase stock-outs in retail, and the ability of automated ordering systems to address some of these challenges. The literature review considered organizational, operational, and technological aspects of the stock-out issue. A thorough investigation of the stock-out issue and various automated ordering system concepts in retail provided the necessary conditions for measuring the effectiveness of automated ordering systems. The primary objective of this study was to determine the relationship between different stock-keeping units' (SKU) attributes and stock-out performance in the retail sector, and to assess the ability of automated ordering systems to tackle the challenges associated with risky SKUs. The data sample was obtained from a large retailer in Serbia, and included two high-risk product categories comprising a total of 115 items and 97 stores, observed over a one-year period. A perpetual inventory aggregation method was used to identify stock-outs, while probit regression and t-test statistics were used to measure the impact of SKU attributes and ordering system performance. Prior to the main statistical analysis, stock-out rate analysis identified patterns of stock-out variation, such as weekly fluctuations, performance differences between SKUs and product categories, which could indicate potential causes of stock-outs and provide valuable input for further analysis. The impact of potentially high-risk SKU attributes on stock-out performance revealed that product availability in the distribution center, promotional activity, and sales speed negatively affect stock-out performance. Positive effects, in terms of fewer stock-outs, were observed when the ordering process was automated. However, the retailer-risk category was more sensitive to promotion and sales speed. Statistical analysis revealed that the automated ordering system performs significantly better than the manual system for cheaper items, promotional items, faster items, and items with significant sales variation, but this was not proven for items with larger packaging. Despite better performance at the store level, significantly better performance was not observed at the distribution center level for items ordered automatically compared to manually ordered items.
