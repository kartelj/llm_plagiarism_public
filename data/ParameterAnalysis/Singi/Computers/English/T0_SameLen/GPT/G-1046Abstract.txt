Modern electronic system users are confident in the high level of personal data and resource protection. They trust that the service provider has taken all necessary measures to prevent failures. The complex protection and user administration system can deter users from utilizing market-offered services. To provide the utmost professional care, communication systems have developed their own protection systems, resistant to all known attack types. However, professional systems must strike a balance between functionality and user protection. Their services are tailored to familiar infrastructure and typically safeguarded with the SSL/TLS protocol using known user data (username and password). This approach creates a balance between functionality and security, neglecting safety rules and authentication for something a user has and something the user is. This paper explores the potential for implementing a solution that maintains system functionality while introducing the principle of other safe authentication rules, something the user has. This paper outlines the development process and features of solutions based on these principles, thereby enhancing the reliability of SSL/TLS authentication through multiple channels.
