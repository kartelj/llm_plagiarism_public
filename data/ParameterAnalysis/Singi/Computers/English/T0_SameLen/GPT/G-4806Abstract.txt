Studies indicate that end users have predominantly shifted from social networking to communication platforms (Viber, WhatsApp, FB messenger, Instagram, etc.). Artificial intelligence, coupled with the concept of digital transformation, is a significant stride in modernizing the business company of each sector. In the fight against COVID 19, and in the creation of innovative solutions that offer added value, chatbot was introduced into the digital realm. It is a software that mimics human conversation and assists user to obtain the correct information and simplify daily services. Over the past decade, the substantial enhancement of communication platforms and networking technologies has offered new technical possibilities for the implementation of chatbots in various sectors, such as e-commerce, customer support, marketing and education. The Chatbot is a software program that simulates conversation using artificial intelligence and engages in dialogue with humans using natural language understanding through textual and voice messages. Chatbot employs artificial intelligence to find answers and address the userâ€™s requests. In line with new trends, the methodological framework for the development of modern chatbot architecture based on artificial intelligence for the next generation of the Internet community is outlined. Consequently, the biggest challenge in the development of the adaptive platform is resolving the issue of integration flexibility, defining the mechanism of independence of chatbots from only one service for natural language understanding (NLU) which would ensure adequate adaptability. The suggested methodology offers a general procedure and is the outcome of a blend of different methodological approaches. According to the outlined methodology, the process of developing an adaptive chatbot based on NLU is split into two primary phases: project engineering and application engineering. Each of these phases is then divided into activities. The benefit of this separation is the realization of an adaptable platform for generating chatbots. It is also proposed scalable and extensible chatbot architecture supporting different services for natural language understanding and communication channels. The paper outlines the logical and physical architecture of chatbots. The independence of the NLU service is guaranteed through suitable metamodels and their mapping rules. The thesis offers its own independent framework for reducing dependence on suppliers that deal with the services of natural language understanding and communication channels. In this manner, independence is achieved from any service for understanding natural language, which will not tie the solution to one service, but the proposed mechanism will provide easy mapping and switching from one to another new NLU service. Finally, one implementation of the suggested solution is summarized through a case study. The Academic Digital Assistant (ADA) is the first educational project in the Balkans that provides better communication, save time, and deliver services faster and more efficiently. The ADA receives messages from various messaging communication platforms (Viber, FB Messenger, Instagram, and the website). The chatbot platform performs a number of important tasks before sending a message to the NLU. The NLU analyzes the text based on machine learning techniques, compares, and then generates intent and its entities. The generated result is sent back to the chatbot platform, which uses a certain algorithm of intent, entities, and context and sends a response to the user in the appropriate format to display the message. ADA is available 24 hours a day and provides answers to frequently asked questions from students and prospective students. ADA knows over 250 scenarios regarding questions an appropriate service that students want to be performed. Some of the scenarios are exam registration, change of examiner, semester certification, information on teacher consultations, deadlines, academy ranking, lecture schedule, student rating, events, service availability, academic environment, date of lectures and exams, activities taking place within the academy and other useful academic information.
