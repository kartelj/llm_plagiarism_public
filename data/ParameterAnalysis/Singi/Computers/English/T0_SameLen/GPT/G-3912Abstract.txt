Tourism that is accessible to all consumer types, also known as accessible tourism, access tourism, barrier-free tourism, and inclusive tourism, is a relatively new and under-researched concept in our domestic market. However, its potential is globally recognized and is the subject of numerous scientific studies and research. It also involves adapting the tourism supply to cater to clients who utilize these services. Offering products and services in an environment that accommodates all users is a significant challenge for the entire tourism sector. By keeping up with global tourism trends and implementing various laws and regulations, or aligning laws and strategies with EU legislation, these client categories are assured equal participation in all social activities, including leisure time. Accessibility must be integrated into every responsible and sustainable tourism policy and strategy, necessitating national-level efforts to invest in the accessibility of all tourism-related industries. Being aware of and adapting regulations is not just crucial for supporting human rights, but also presents a business opportunity. However, it is crucial to alter our mindset and service delivery model. This paper focuses on hotel services designed to cater to the needs of accessible tourism users. Accessible environments and services contribute to enhancing the quality of hotel products, thereby increasing the overall competitiveness of tourism destinations. The research results analysis reveals the management of Belgrade's accessible hotels' attitude towards accessible tourism. The paper examines their attitude towards accessible tourism consumers, the range of services tailored to them, HR policies, and the promotion intensity of accessible accommodation. The research was conducted to understand management's perspective on how accessible tourism contributes to their business success.
