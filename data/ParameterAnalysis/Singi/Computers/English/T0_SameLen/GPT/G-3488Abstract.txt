Continuous access to enhancements in product, service, and software quality allows organizations to adapt swiftly to rapid shifts typical of contemporary market economies. Sustaining market competitiveness is achieved through ongoing upgrades in product, service, and software quality. Quality enhancement can only be realized by managing all process input elements affecting quality. In this dissertation, we will examine the concept of product as the "outcome of a specific process", which includes: 1) product; 2) service and 3) software. This dissertation will present the methodology for establishing and assessing user requirements and identifying process input elements - factors influencing the satisfaction of these needs. During product realization, numerous factors affect quality and user requirement fulfillment, complicating product quality management. There are always multiple alternative solutions for quality improvement. Each improvement solution is marked by specific implementation costs and varying effects on product quality. While it's easy to calculate implementation costs for each solution, the challenge lies in determining the impact of specific factor improvements on product quality and, indirectly, user satisfaction. The issue is selecting the optimal combination of quality-impacting factors within limited financial resources. What will be the outcome of enhancing certain quality-impacting factors? To examine the effect of improving factors affecting product quality on the final product's compliance with user requirements, we will use a final product conformity simulation using Markov's process with the Matlab programming language. This dissertation significantly contributes to enhancing modeling methodology and managing factors affecting product quality. A notable contribution of this dissertation is its societal impact and ability to address practical issues in business systems related to process quality improvement affecting requirement fulfillment. The research results can guide decision-making on the direction to take for product quality improvement. Key words: quality, product quality, process input elements, factors affecting product quality, quality improvement, Markov's processes, quality improvement effects simulation.
