This thesis's research aimed to identify the algorithms and software frameworks for adaptive systems applicable in traffic regulation at light-controlled intersections. A model for determining the signal plan for a four-way intersection, managed by traffic lights, with two or more phases where traffic can occur under unsaturated (non-congested) and saturated (congested) traffic conditions, has been developed. A unique analysis was carried out, along with functionality testing of the proposed adaptive systems for traffic regulation when emergency vehicles are passing through the intersection, and when such vehicles are in the dilemma zone.
