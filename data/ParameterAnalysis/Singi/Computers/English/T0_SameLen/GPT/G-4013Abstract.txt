'This PhD dissertation explores a technically efficient and socially applicable solution to guarantee the identity of each newborn baby. The importance of this issue has significantly increased due to past suspicions of baby swapping or theft in Serbian birthplaces. It's important to note the numerous lawsuits, particularly those from the International Court of Law in Strasbourg, France, related to this issue. The proposed solution involves an original distributed information system and a unique patented device for biometric parental identification based on fingerprint minutiae. The information system and device ensure synergy and efficiency of the entire proposed solution, guaranteeing 100% real-time accuracy in newborn identity and providing proof of parenthood. Special consideration was given to the system's security aspects, given the sensitivity of the data. Independent algorithms were developed for data collection and identity verification of both mother and baby at birth and upon leaving the birthplace, as well as procedures and timing for these actions. Cancelable biometrics are used to ensure complete safety from data compromise or security corruption. Implementing this system will significantly improve this aspect of the Serbian healthcare system, benefiting institutions (birthplaces, hospitals) and the quality of service for citizens. It will completely eliminate the possibility of human error and streamline numerous procedures in the existing system used in Serbian hospitals for childbirth. This PhD dissertation will present a system that prevents any potential identity changes, swapping, or theft of babies, improving the speed and quality of service to ensure babies are 100% theirs in real-time conditions.'
