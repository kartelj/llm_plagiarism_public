Cloud computing security is a multifaceted and intricate issue, intersecting with numerous fields such as computer network security, computer security, information security, legal regulation implementation, and more. Regrettably, it's also a primary reason why cloud computing isn't utilized as much as its exceptional benefits suggest it should be. One of the most secure methods of safeguarding data in the cloud is undoubtedly through cryptographic techniques. The security of ciphertext stored in the cloud relies solely on the security of the cryptographic algorithms used and the security of the keys. However, storing data on the cloud as ciphertext has the drawback of not being able to process this data within the cloud without decrypting it, which poses a security risk. One potential solution to this issue is the use of homomorphic cryptosystems. Their capability to process data in encrypted form and produce an encrypted result that can only be decrypted by someone with the keys is considered by some to be the holy grail of cryptography. Recently, the academic community has been making significant strides in researching and enhancing encryption methods that allow for the processing of ciphertext in the cloud. Observing these trends, we've noticed that the relationship between the encryption method used on the cloud and systems with limited computational resources is underexplored, and there's considerable potential for its application in daily life. In this dissertation, we've investigated and demonstrated how homomorphic encryption can be safely used to leverage the applications provided by the cloud. The introduction of the thesis presents the fundamental ideas that inspired research on the dissertation's topic. We establish the hypotheses of the scientific research, the methods to be used, and the planned research work trajectory, along with the anticipated scientific contribution. The second chapter discusses cloud computing, presenting the historical development of cloud computing and data related to its definition through various literature sources. The third chapter explains the concept and defines homomorphism in cipher systems using mathematical tools. The fourth chapter addresses the issue of enhancing encryption key security using a virtual file system. The storage and application of encryption keys is a critical issue during the practical implementation of a cipher system. During our research, we proposed storing encryption keys on Smart Card devices. This solution has been implemented in Unix/Linux operating systems and practically applied in the study. The fifth chapter outlines the dissertation's most significant scientific contributions. It details the observed problem, proposes a simpler model for the problem, and describes the implementation of the proposed solutions, which in this case were realized on two different platforms: the industrial computer Raspberry Pi and Android mobile phones. Based on these results, we can see the limitations in terms of the length of the applied keys, the number of monitored sensors, and the length of the results found in the corrective function of the proposed model. Throughout the chapters, parts of the developed code for the Unix/Linux operating system and the Android operating system used for the experiment are included. In conclusion, the thesis presents the basic scientific contributions and offers directions for potential future research in this field.
