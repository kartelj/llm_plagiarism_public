The intricacy of the adaptive e-education process has resulted in a limited number of studies examining its methodological and integrated system development aspects. Therefore, the information provided in this paper is of particular importance and contributes significantly to the field. E-education is a multifaceted system encompassing distance learning and teaching, diverse teaching materials, individual and group learning, tutoring, and interactive work. To enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of e-education systems, students' preferences and learning styles must be taken into account. Data from business information systems, distance education systems, surveys, and teacher evaluations are used to identify these preferences. These data are used to facilitate adaptation, a process that modifies the system based on the student's knowledge. The primary objectives of adapting an e-education system include improving course design and utility, increasing student loyalty, assisting in course information retrieval, advanced searching, and storing search results in the context of student interests. This dissertation posits and substantiates the hypothesis that incorporating an adaptive model into the LMS system in e-education can enhance the educational process, elevate the quality of business processes in e-education, and justify its induction cost. The application of the developed adaptive model can address remote education issues such as tailoring teaching material to students' needs, implementing a quality reporting system based on data collected in learning management systems, establishing an electronic learning portal, and more. This results in increased student enrollment and graduation rates, reduced costs, improved fund utilization, and better decision-making. This doctoral dissertation delves into the application of adaptive methods and techniques in e-education, with the goal of creating an adaptive model for the subject Programming for Internet. The experimental portion was executed as an adaptive electronic course for JAVA programming at the Informatics laboratory of the Professional Studies College of Technology in Sabac, Serbia. Standard statistical methods were used to measure relevant parameters and analyze the results. The findings indicate that students who participated in the course adapted through the demonstrated methods and techniques performed better than those who attended the non-adapted course.
