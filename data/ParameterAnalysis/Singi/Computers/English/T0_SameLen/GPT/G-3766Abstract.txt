The aim of this dissertation was twofold: to evaluate the state of patients with neuro-motor diseases using health care sensor networks, and to determine if tennis is a more effective rehabilitation method than standard reeducation procedures. An additional objective was to demonstrate that these sensor networks are increasingly vulnerable, a significant factor to monitor. The thesis compares the progress and recovery of two similar patients, one undergoing traditional rehabilitation and the other using tennis as a therapeutic sport. Furthermore, the overall group's progress is compared to a control group. The study also examines the health care sensor networks, their security, and proper installation. The research findings confirm that patients treated with tennis improved more quickly and effectively, with stronger stroke power by the study's end than those undergoing standard rehabilitation. Thus, the research outcome was successful. My other hypothesis was also validated, as technological advancements lead to more frequent security breaches in various networks.
