The primary objective of this study is to develop a comprehensive semiotics/axiology model of discernment-interpretation-reasoning, with a specific focus on its application to visual objects, phenomena, and media, often seen as value bearers or value creators. This research will not address every individual visual subject or linguistic expression used across various human interest areas in values. Instead, it will suggest a broad strategy, a fundamental reasoning method about the conditions and reasons for creating diverse values, and the utterances, numerous expressions, and words, both historical and new. It will propose an organization and classification method for distinguishing, interpreting, reasoning, perceiving, and evaluating sensory phenomena, particularly visual phenomena. Along with a brief history of semiotic considerations, the resulting theory will offer a fresh interpretation and technical expressions of semiotics/axiology, the critical sign/symbol theory, clarify them, define them, and then propose and demonstrate their application in interpreting and evaluating four aspects (aesthetic, functional, moral-ethical, cognitive) of sensory phenomena, with a particular emphasis on the human visual sensitivity field and the visual appearance of phenomena, as well as on processes, media, and media in the construction of artificial phenomena, and on sign/symbolic coding and decoding in the practices of visual arts, design, and communication design presented by historical examples. The research's specific goal is to illustrate and exhibit the dynamics of semiotic differentiation-interpretation-evaluation of phenomena that necessarily presupposes and is inseparable and limited by anthropo-centrically generated dualities, primary polarities, such as: subject / object, real / unreal, true / false, / suitable / unsuitable, pleasant / unpleasant, functional / dysfunctional , etc., i.e. by the structurally set value polarities embodied in technofacts during five historical phases: Western Renaissance, pre-industrial, industrial, information and post-information periods, and to demonstrate how historical, culturally generated and semantically defined polarities chronologically tend to “equalize”, by (r)evolutions, turns and hierarchical reversals, and at the same time tend to reproduce, maintain the syntactic continuity and structural integrity of duality, that is to preserve the structurally primary polarity of the mathematical type +/-, by the means of analyzing historic events, examples and milestones that contributed to the semantic changes in polarity in the sense framework of creativity, innovation, historical increase in production, reproductive, multiplicative efficiency, and distribution of values.
