Creating high-quality random number sequences is a crucial and sensitive aspect of any cryptographic system, necessitating a meticulous and scholarly approach to the design and verification of generator characteristics. The quality of sequences produced by random value generators based on sound cards is significantly influenced by the randomness source's height of entropy and the post-processing procedure employed. This post-processing procedure distills the digitized form of a random analog signal, resulting in a uniformly distributed set of genuinely random numbers. This dissertation focuses on analyzing existing and introducing a new class of random sequence generators that utilize a sound card. Random number sequences are indispensable in various fields, including cryptography, simulation, gambling, sampling, decision-making, medicine, aesthetics, and art. The most commonly used random value generator is the pseudorandom number generator (PRNG), a mathematical algorithm that produces a deterministic, periodic array of numerical values determined by the initial state, known as SID. In contrast, true random number generators (TRNG) are based on non-deterministic natural phenomena such as sound noise, radioactive decay, semiconductor-generated thermal noise, resistor thermal noise, photoelectric effects, and various quantum phenomena, producing non-periodic true random numbers. Numerous studies have been conducted to optimize random number generation using sound cards, with most approaches based on PRNG requirements or structures. This dissertation presents a method for generating true random bits using computer hardware's sound card, which is induced with environmental random signal noise, and post-processing (distillation) with a new process of mixing the input string and XOR-ing neighboring bits (Mibis & XOR). This post-processing method effectively separates and removes correlated adjacent bits from the input string, then XORs neighboring bits in the newly obtained set, reducing autocorrelation, increasing entropy, and reducing output bits set bias. Statistical randomness tests have shown that this class of generators exhibits excellent characteristics and generates a large volume of high-quality true random numbers in a short time. The first part of the dissertation (Chapters 2 and 3) presents the theoretical foundation necessary for understanding the original contributions outlined in the second part. Chapter 2 introduces concepts of random process, random signal, and stochastic signal sources as necessary factors in generating a true random number series, while Chapter 3 covers the basics of sound cards and environmental noise signals. The second part of the dissertation (Chapters 4 and 5) presents original research findings. Chapter 4 presents the results achieved in developing new methods for generating random sequences and the basic characteristics of true random number generators. The working principle, classification, characteristics, latest research, designs, and stages of true random number generators are explained in detail, along with various post-processing techniques, their effectiveness, advantages, and disadvantages. Chapter 5 presents the results of applying new distillation techniques. The dissertation emphasizes the importance and development of new methods for generating true random sequences to create fast, efficient, affordable, and widely accessible random number generators. Special attention is given to developing new effective methods for generating random sequences using the hardware potential of personal desktop systems and new types of laptops, tablets, and smartphone devices. The efficient system presented allows for rapid generation of random values with sufficient unpredictability, making it suitable for many applications in various fields, even though it is intended for cryptographic purposes. The results contribute to the development of hardware and software-environment foundations for further improvements in random sequence generator processes.
