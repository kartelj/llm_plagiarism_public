Research in human-computer interaction incorporates a multidisciplinary approach, drawing from fields such as computer science, psychology, sociology, cognitive sciences, and design. Modern interfaces facilitate interaction through a variety of sensors like mouse, keyboard, eye tracking monitor, EEG, pulse monitor, heart rate monitor, etc. The focus of this research is the application of artificial intelligence in analyzing and evaluating human-computer interaction and cognitive performance of respondents. The system's superior data analysis speed allows for real-time feedback, making it an active participant in the interaction. The feasibility of developing an AI model for collecting and analyzing human-computer interaction data was demonstrated using four cognitive performance assessments - Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WSCT), Visual Short Term Working Memory Test (VSTWMT), mTutor Test, and the AC Test. Individual client applications were developed for each experiment, capable of connecting to sensor applications via the Synchronization Platform (HCI-MAP). Data was collected using three sensors: an EEG device, an eye tracking device, and a computer mouse. Independent sensor applications were created to communicate with the EEG and eye tracking device, allowing for data aggregation and joint processing. Our research results showed some deviation from reference values in participant performance on the computer version of the WCS test. Visual short-term memory (VSTM), the ability to remember small amounts of visual information for a short period, was also examined. The experiment was conducted in two sessions, with the first in an isolated environment and the second in front of an audience. EEG data was classified using four algorithms: Naive Bayes, Support Vector, KNN, and Random Forest. The results indicated a high accuracy rate in classifying the order and type of images presented. The mTutor platform experiment aimed to develop an AI model for electronic knowledge assessment that accurately reflects respondent knowledge. Although no strong correlation was found between any individual parameter and response accuracy, it was concluded that the emotional state of subjects could be influenced by the type of questions asked. The AC test assessed attention levels, and a high correlation was found between gaze position and mouse cursor position. The research concluded that AI can effectively analyze human-computer interaction, potentially producing results comparable or superior to human analysis. Distributed solutions can provide real-time system feedback, and AI can accurately assess user cognitive performance.
