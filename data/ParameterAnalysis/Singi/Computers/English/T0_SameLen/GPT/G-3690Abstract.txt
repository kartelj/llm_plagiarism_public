Digital images and their processing have significantly advanced the field of medicine, one of the sciences that has greatly benefited from this progress. The use of computers to process medical digital images can dramatically expedite the diagnostic process by identifying even the minutest tissue changes that are undetectable to the human eye. Medical image processing encompasses images produced from various sources such as X-rays, ultrasounds, magnetic resonance, and captured by different devices like scanners, microscopic images, endoscopic capsules, and more. The continuous advancement in medical imaging technology has resulted in high-resolution images, three-dimensional anatomical and physiological images. However, this progress has also brought about new issues and challenges in medical image processing. Many of these challenges pose difficult optimization problems for which nature-inspired algorithms, particularly swarm intelligence algorithms, have been effectively utilized for over two decades. To use these algorithms for optimizing medical digital image processing problems, they need to be adapted and modified for a specific problem. This subject is an active area of research, as evidenced by the numerous scientific and professional articles, books, journals, and conferences dedicated to it. This thesis presents several swarm intelligence algorithms and their application to various medical digital image processing optimization problems. Specifically, the bat algorithm, fireworks algorithm, and firefly algorithm were employed for retina image registration, brain MRI segmentation, bleeding detection in endoscopic capsule images, image compression, leukemia detection in microscopic images, and emphysema detection in CT lung images. Each problem considered is unique, and swarm intelligence algorithms have been adapted to address them. Modified and customized swarm intelligence algorithms for use in processing medical digital images were tested on standard benchmark test images compiled for the problems being examined. A comparison of the proposed methods for enhancing medical digital image processing using swarm intelligence algorithms with other cutting-edge algorithms from literature revealed superior results. This suggests that better methods and techniques for solving optimization problems arising from the analysis and processing of medical digital images can be discovered by adjusting and implementing swarm intelligence algorithms.
