This doctoral thesis proposes a unique fingerprint biometric cryptosystem, utilizing the fuzzy commitment scheme and deep convolutional neural networks. The paper's primary innovation is a new method for automatic discretization of fingerprint texture descriptors, entirely reliant on a convolutional neural network, and crafted to produce fixed-length templates. The suggested quantization of the extracted features through two-bit coding converts biometric templates into a binary domain, enabling the use of XOR biometrics and the creation of a biometric cryptosystem for key-release or as a safeguard for fingerprint matching systems. The issue of biometric data variability is minimized by implementing secure block-level Bose–Chaudhuri–Hocquenghem error correction codes, impervious to statistical-based attacks. The recommended biometric cryptosystem can handle a key length of 265 bits, satisfying modern cryptographic system standards, with a tolerable EER of 1%. The assessment reveals substantial performance improvements compared to other texture-based fingerprint matching and biometric cryptosystems.
