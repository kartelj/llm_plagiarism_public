This article focuses on investigating the extraction of information from multimodal business documents in a desktop setting. A document communicates information through various modalities, such as text, layout/style, and images. For instance, scientific papers often include figures to demonstrate experimental findings, and the title in a scientific paper typically has a different font size than the main text. The conventional method of IR (Information Retrieval) is indexing and retrieval using only text. However, with the evolution of the Internet and Digital Libraries, it is increasingly crucial to develop IR methods for smart indexing and retrieval of multimodal documents. Indexing and retrieval are two crucial elements of an IR system. Given a set of documents, indexing characterizes documents using an index language. Retrieval employs the outcomes of indexing and locates relevant documents in response to a user's query. Text and image modalities employ different indexing and retrieval methods. Single-modality IR, whether using text or images, has restrictions. Multimodal IR seeks to surpass the limitations of each individual modality by integrating them.
