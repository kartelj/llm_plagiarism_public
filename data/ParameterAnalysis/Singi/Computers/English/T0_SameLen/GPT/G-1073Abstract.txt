The dissertation's focus is on investigating e-business systems interoperability models, viewed from various angles, and based on service-oriented software development. The research examined: standards, interoperability frameworks and enterprise information systems architecture, ontologies-based semantic technologies, and service orientation. The dissertation contributes to resolving interoperability issues by presenting: a methodological framework for ad-hoc e-business systems connection, a universal meta model for ensuring system's semantic consistency and the description and discovery of e-business systems components; a service-oriented architecture model for semantic interoperability of business processes on an ad-hoc basis. The research's verification was achieved by enhancing interoperability and business process execution in the cultural heritage protection sectors. The results obtained have enhanced the utilization of available information, documents, and illustrative material related to various cultural artifacts.
