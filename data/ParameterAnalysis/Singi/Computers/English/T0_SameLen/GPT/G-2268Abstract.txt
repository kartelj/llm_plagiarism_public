The necessity for enhancing the transfer speed of multimedia data and the stricter copyright protection demands in today's society are becoming more evident. In this scenario, FSO communications serve as an excellent substitute for traditional wireless communication systems. These systems, where applicable, offer users exceptionally high performance, with data transfer rates reaching several Gb and virtually superior security options. Due to its cost-effective implementation, it is practical and significant in the "last mile" connection. This study investigates the feasibility of transmitting images via the FSO communication channel amidst scintillation. It examines the transmission of copyright-protected data (watermarked images) and the effect of FSO channels on their degradation, degradation or protection code, as well as color images to detect fires in the image post transmission over the FSO communication channel.
