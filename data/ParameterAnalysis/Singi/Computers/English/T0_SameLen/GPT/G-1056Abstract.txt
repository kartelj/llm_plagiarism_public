Predictions suggest that the future of information security should undergo a significant and fundamental shift towards a new theoretical computer security paradigm. This shift would enable the creation of a comprehensive set of protection mechanisms, the compromise of which would not rely on an attacker's computational power. It's worth noting that the foundation for this proposition is the creation of new digital signal processing methods that the physical layer of contemporary communication networks should provide ample information. The use of purely random extraction could aid in the development of new protocols and encryption key exchanges with maximum length and ambiguity. In the realm of trustworthy and acceptable authentication practices, biometrics are becoming a crucial source of cryptology parameters. The digital signal processing of biometrics is vital for creating and extracting maximum entropy authentication codes. In the area of digital content copyright management, both visible and invisible digital embossing seals are crucial. All these factors contribute to a new position for this discipline in the theory and practice of general information protection systems. The proposed thesis identifies, analyzes, and develops a class of digital signal processing subsystems to address the new challenges posed by these advancements in information protection in modern computer and communication systems. The primary focus is on developing a class of encryption key systems based on iris biometrics.
