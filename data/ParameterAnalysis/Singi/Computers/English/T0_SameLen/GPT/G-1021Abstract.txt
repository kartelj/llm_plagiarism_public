Given that Earth is home to over 7 billion people, with projections of 9 billion by 2050, identifying individuals while maintaining privacy is a significant challenge. From a collective security standpoint, biometric identification has become a primary requirement for many governments and security agencies. Numerous privately-owned companies are also developing biometric identification technology, seizing the opportunity to enter a lucrative market previously exclusive to the government sector. The United States, despite economic issues, invests heavily in biometric identification, particularly after the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001. China, with its booming economy, is also making substantial efforts to develop biometric identification mechanisms. Given China's status as the most populous country, this challenge takes on a new dimension. In India, the motivation for introducing biometric identification technology is not security-related, but rather for more critical issues like food distribution. The European Union, led by the Netherlands, is also heavily invested in the development and application of biometric identification. The privacy of collected biometric data largely depends on the policies and attitudes of organizations handling the acquisition and storage of such data, and the methods used to protect it. Even if these are state institutions, considered "trusted", abuse is always a potential risk. Balancing security and privacy is a topic of global research. Over recent decades, various approaches to this issue have been proposed. The advancement of information technology has contributed to the development of new approaches due to new possibilities. It's important to remember that biometric data is "noisy", meaning it doesn't always represent in the same way. This means that certain principles of classical logic cannot be directly applied in this field. Also, the use of cryptographic procedures with biometric data is not possible as it doesn't meet the necessary criteria. Fuzzy Logic offers a new approach that aligns with human thought processes and is used in many proposed solutions for biometric identification. Some solutions suggest extracting cryptographic keys directly from biometric data using fuzzy extractor functions. These functions account for the uncertainty of biometric data measurements. After introducing randomization and using specific procedures, a unique "key" or fuzzy sketch is created. Other solutions propose creating a cryptographic key independently, which meets all cryptographic requirements, and then combining it with the biometric data. Within this group, various error-correcting methods are used to compensate for the fuzziness of the biometric data. Some authors suggest using a sequence of error-correcting methods. The media for archiving can vary, but a polycarbonate card with a microcontroller is a common solution. Previous solutions can be evaluated from multiple perspectives, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses. The main disadvantage of solutions using a fuzzy sketch is the exposure of biometric features in an open format during the decoding process. Additionally, the process of decrypting a fuzzy sketch is not reliable enough for practical applications. Solutions that independently create a cryptographic key and combine it with biometric data yield better results than those using a sketch. There are opinions that sketch-based solutions could be improved by refining their mathematical models, but the main drawback remains - the exposure of unprotected biometric data at some point in the process. The use of different or successively combined error-correcting methods generally yield good results. Some solutions that treat the iris as biometric data produce accurate results. These solutions are not efficient for processing fingerprints due to the different binary representations of the iris and fingerprint. The solution proposed in this paper treats the fingerprint as biometric data. After identifying and distinguishing minutiae - the characteristic points of the fingerprint, two independent templates are created. The first template is used for identification, while the second combines biometrics with a pre-built cryptographic key. The cryptographic key is pre-processed with error correction encoding. The proposed solution uses Slepian Wolf encoding. The second template is encrypted biometric information with an incorporated cryptographic key. Both templates are then stored on a token such as a card with a microprocessor. During the reconstruction of the cryptographic key, the original biometric - fingerprint must be present. The first step is identification, which determines whether it is the same fingerprint, or the same person. After positive identification, key reconstruction is processed by separating the cryptographic key from the fingerprint and re-applying Slepian Wolf encoding on the cryptographic key to correct errors. The cryptographic key can then be used in standard cryptographic operations. The proposed solution significantly reduces errors in person identification and in the process of cryptographic key reconstruction. Therefore, it is efficient and suitable for practical use. It also enhances the security of the original fingerprint image, which is not exposed in an open form at any stage of the process. The solution outlined in this paper is resistant to a wide range of potential attacks aimed at compromising biometric data and, consequently, personal identity.
