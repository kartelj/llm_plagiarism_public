Culture's perpetuation shapes society, which is constructed through the enhancement and progression of culture and knowledge. The tool for societal improvement is education, with a crucial component being the evaluation of acquired knowledge and practical skills. Among all natural and technical sciences, computer science frequently employs assessments to gauge students' practical skills level. Various assessment methods are employed in education. The goal of refining these methods is to attain precise and unbiased assessment. The literature mentions outdated methods, as well as those still in use. The most prevalent among them are closed question type tests and practical work evaluations and assessments. Tests are beneficial for gauging knowledge level, while practical work reviews are useful for determining practical skills level. Both methods can be executed manually or automatically. Automated methods necessitate setups that allow execution without examiner involvement. Based on professional experience, manual student assessment is challenging to conduct with the necessary neutrality and accuracy, irrespective of the method. Consequently, it is recommended to utilize automated assessments. However, using these methods to determine both the level of acquired knowledge and practical skills is difficult, as these methods are unsuitable for both use cases. This paper investigates the most common issues in the literature review. The paper aims to find a method for accurately and objectively assessing students' practical skills in a programming-related subject. Over the study's four-year span, two student generations were tested with these two unique solutions. One method employs an electronic multichoice test to evaluate student knowledge, while the other examines the correctness of the student's practical work. This paper provides answers to several research questions, obtained by analyzing the data collected using these two assessment methods. The research employed quantitative and qualitative methods to analyze the gathered data. Additionally, the paper includes case studies of assessment methods used to conduct these assessments and collect data from the research period. Case studies elaborate on the introduced assessment tools. The paper investigates the feasibility of creating a tool that can substitute the teacher as an examiner by automating the review and evaluation of practical works; comparing the similarity of assessment results from both assessment methods; on the utility of tests to gauge the level of practical skills; and on the possibility of providing an unbiased assessment, without examiner influence. The paper includes discussions of analyzed data and research conclusions. This study suggests a method to objectively and accurately evaluate the level of practical skills in programming-related subjects in the field of computer science, at the bachelor academic level. Solutions for achieving this objective are introduced. In addition to the scientific, this research also has a practical contribution.
