During the rapid growth phase of information technologies, they found significant use in education. Many educational bodies utilize the DLS education platform, often supplementing traditional learning methods. However, an increasing number of tertiary institutions globally and domestically have adopted this training style and established distance learning. This paper's research objective was to outline the present condition of quality DLS e-learning systems. The progression of e-learning model models was investigated, and potential future paths were suggested. The incorporation of learning management systems, intelligent tutoring systems, adaptive educational hypermedia systems in education has facilitated the creation of a vast repository of information on student learning methods. Learning Management Systems (LMS) are employed to develop, organize, execute, administer online courses, training programs, irrespective of their specific location and timing. Moodle (Modular Object Dynamic Learning Environment) is among the most prevalent learning management systems. This open-source system operates on a series of PHP modules installed on the Web server and MySQL, Postgres databases. The focus was on enhancing student performance in exams and the technical elements of the e-learning system that could guarantee sustainable system growth amidst the swift changes in the development and application of information and communication technologies.
