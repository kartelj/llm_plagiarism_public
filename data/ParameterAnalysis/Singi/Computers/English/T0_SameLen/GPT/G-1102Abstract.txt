The methodologies and procedures of structural and object-oriented modeling, along with systems and processes approaches, yield optimal results in design, development, and ICT security practice. The security processes of the system, which convert inputs into outputs and ideally enhance the value of output parameters, amalgamate procedures, tools, and competent and driven individuals to execute security practice tasks. It is crucial to consistently assess and enhance security processes, as owners, managers, and regular users typically have insufficient security awareness, and security technologies and specialists are relatively costly. Process-oriented standards and models, such as CMM (Capability Maturity Model), especially SSE CMM (System Security Engineering Capability Maturity Model), have been devised to assess quality and track the progress of process maturity and enhancement. Comparative analysis of the correlation between standards and models, based on system, process, or environment approaches, suggests numerous opportunities to establish additional frameworks for process assessment and enhancement. CMMs that incorporate processes (SSE CMM, CMMI) offer a unified and integrated framework for evaluating and enhancing various processes. The SSE CMM incorporates SSE (11), project management (5), and organizational (6) process areas. In the SSE CMM, process performance quality and maturity are gauged by a specific system and process-oriented metric, based on basic (BP) and generic (GP) practices performance and implementation criteria. The SSE CMM metric categorizes the capability (CL) and maturity (ML) levels into 5 active levels. The SSAM (System Security Appraisal Method), based on the SSE CMM model, is specifically designed to perform a verification type of evaluation that not only uncovers but verifies objective data of the BP and GP practices performance and implementation. Experimental evaluation of the current ESS processes on three evaluated projects and a proposal for a process improvement action plan confirm the declared user acceptability and applicability of the SSE CMM model and the SSAM method to the evaluation and enhancement of security processes for optimal security program development, security organization profiling, and a number of other ICT security applications.
