In the early 21st century, IT became essential to education. A significant issue during this time was procuring equipment and integrating information technology into contemporary education. Many developing countries underutilize the impressive features of this technology, primarily due to inadequate technical equipment in schools and insufficient teacher training for its use. Most schools employ software that falls under the proprietary software of IT firms, which they sell at steep prices. This study aims to introduce a fresh research perspective in the information systems and education field. Specifically, it highlights the potential and influence of Open Source Software (OSS). This subject is highly relevant in professional circles, especially since Munich decided to transition to OSS to save substantial funds. Now, some EU countries are contemplating transitioning their computer systems to OSS, and some have already taken initial steps in this direction. This subject warrants consideration from various angles, including economic, technological, pedagogical, sociological, cultural, legal, and more. This paper presents comparisons between Microsoft Windows and Linux operating systems, a current topic in the IT world regarding their applicability and superiority. It also examines the technological competition between Open Source and proprietary software code, considering their origin and development philosophy. To demonstrate the applicability of these systems on the same hardware as their competitors, we conducted tests that show the feasibility of both systems on identical hardware architectures.
