Government, military, police, and security agencies require the utmost level of communication protection in their professional systems. They cannot depend on publicly accessible protection systems or security systems not developed internally, whose operation principles or potential design and implementation flaws are known externally. To achieve the highest level of communication protection, these professional systems must create their own protection systems resistant to all known attack types. Comprehensive communication system development involves component development at every level, from the user interface to the communication infrastructure. This development demands significant resources and investments, as well as adequate time for development, testing, and debugging. This paper discusses the potential use of public communication infrastructures and technologies for developing and using a system offering the highest possible communication protection level. The paper presents a detailed development process and the characteristics of a solution based on integrating proprietary ciphers on the network communication layer.
