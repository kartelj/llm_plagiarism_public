This dissertation investigates the performance analysis of wireless transmission over α-k-µ-g and k-µ-g fading channels. The probability density function (PDF) and cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for such a channel have been formulated in closed-form expressions. Standard performance metrics of the received signal, such as outage probability (OP) and level crossing rate (LCR), have been determined for this transmission scenario, based on different system parameter values. Additionally, the enhancement of these performance metrics when space diversity is employed at reception has been examined. The thesis considers several space diversity methods, specifically selection combining (SC) and maximal-ratio combining (MRC), to highlight how the impact of fading can be minimized. The dissertation also analyzes the simultaneous occurrence of multipath fading and shadowing, and contemplates the use of macro-diversity reception combining with micro-diversity combining to counter these detrimental effects and enhance reception signal quality. The results derived from the dissertation demonstrate that the proposed method ensures a reduction in the detrimental effects of observed α-k-µ-g and k-µ-g fading in various wireless transmission scenarios.
