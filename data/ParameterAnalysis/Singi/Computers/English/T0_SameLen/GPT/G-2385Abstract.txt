Mobile phone usage is on the rise daily. Looking at mobile device history, it's clear that manufacturers have created highly advanced devices, aptly named smartphones. Their enhanced capabilities and impact on our daily lives have made us increasingly reliant on these modern mobile phones. Smartphones are utilized for various purposes such as phone calls, internet browsing, using different services (SMS, MMS, email), camera or GPS usage. As mobile technology evolves, initial security issues arise, affecting the communication channel, i.e., data transmission from sender to receiver. Security risks to these devices are growing due to insufficient security mechanisms and protective tools. The introduction of mobile phone operating systems has further complicated this issue. Each operating system offers numerous user benefits but also presents several security vulnerabilities. Considering the rising popularity of internet access via mobile devices, risks associated with secure communication and establishing a communication channel are present. With the widespread use of mobile devices, mobile communication security for all users must be considered. Open source projects provide developers with a range of options for creating their own solutions based on their ideas. Access to an operating system's source code has led to an operating system that has outperformed all others and become a global market leader in mobile phones. The Android operating system quickly became popular among developers and beyond due to its reliance on the Java programming language. Android serves as an open platform for mobile devices, allowing modifications even at the operating system level. Consequently, developers can create unique security mechanisms based on the kernel that are not typical for other mobile platforms. The Android operating system is Linux-based and part of an Open Source Association. In the seven years since its inception up to the writing of this paper, the Android operating system has progressed to version 7.0. This paper analyzes Android's security mechanisms, identifies certain shortcomings manifested in the system's low-level security framework. Survey results indicate a lack of user knowledge regarding mobile phone internet safety. Detailed analysis of the Android operating system and its security mechanisms suggest a need to enhance Android's security framework. Improvement measures were proposed, specifically enhancing security levels using SE Linux. A comparison was made, and differences between the AOSP (Android Open Source Project) and the proposed SE Android (Security Enhanced) system were highlighted. The paper concludes with future work directions.
