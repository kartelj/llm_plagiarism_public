The doctoral thesis focuses on contemporary issues concerning cryptographic key exchange and user authentication in a covert communication system. The study examines existing solutions in the research field and the development of a proprietary covert communication system. The academic objective of the thesis is to enhance the protocol for cryptographic key exchange using electronic identification (eID). Existing research approaches were scrutinized to bolster the security level during covert communication and lay the groundwork for the development of a proprietary system. By integrating cryptographic methods that guarantee confidentiality, authenticity, and integrity, along with steganographic methods for clandestine information exchange, users of the suggested system can exchange covert messages securely and efficiently. Upon analyzing the research results, it was determined that the use of secret cryptographic key exchange via electronic identification is justified.
