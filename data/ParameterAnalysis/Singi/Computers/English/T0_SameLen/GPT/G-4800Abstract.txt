Today's two primary technologies are considered to be the Internet of Things and blockchain. The enhancement of system connectivity and reduction of delays have increased the flexibility of using applications on remote devices. The main issue with the Internet of Things is the lack of sufficient computing resources; limited memory and weak, energy-efficient processors hinder the use of strong encryption algorithms. The Internet of Things encounters numerous challenges, including poor interoperability, security vulnerabilities, privacy concerns, and a lack of standards. This paper suggests employing a software interface as a security gateway architecture for intelligent devices. This security interface enables the use of more robust cryptographic algorithms to service smart devices remotely. This method improves the security of data transmitted by smart devices by utilizing compatible data encryption algorithms before sending to remote services. Alongside the interface, this paper also employs blockchain technology. The rationale for using blockchain technology is to incorporate decentralization and authentication into the network of connected smart devices. The inclusion of the blockchain provides the much-needed anonymity and flexibility that the current Internet of Things lacks. Blockchain safeguards the interface with its single point control technologies, records and validates all transactions, thereby establishing trust among devices on a single network. The outcome of this research is the creation of an interface that enables smart devices to use any cryptographic algorithm, offers the capability to map IP addresses, and thus prevents unauthorized network access. In addition to the interface development, blockchain technology will be incorporated in a compatible mode to efficiently operate on smart devices, considering resource constraints.
