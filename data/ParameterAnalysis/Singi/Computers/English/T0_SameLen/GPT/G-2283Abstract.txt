This study aims to assess the competitiveness of Serbia's economy, the efficacy of its competitiveness policy, and the role of clusters in enhancing regional competitiveness. The methodologies employed to evaluate these hypotheses were developed by the World Economic Forum, the Center for Strategy and Competitiveness, University of Stockholm, and the European Cluster Observatory. The goal of analyzing how robust clusters contribute to regional competitiveness was to establish a correlation between the strength of clusters in regions, gauged by the location quotient, and GDPpc as a productivity indicator, in the following five countries (also known as G-5): Hungary, Bulgaria, Greece, Romania, and Serbia. The statistical data utilized in this study were collected from the Statistical Office of Serbia, EUROSTAT, the World Economic Forum, and the European Cluster Observatory. The findings of the analysis reveal that Serbian competitiveness indicators are declining, particularly when compared to other countries at a similar development stage, and the measures of competitiveness policy are inadequate and ineffective. In the G-5 countries, a positive correlation was found between the strength of clusters in regions and regional competitiveness in 13 out of 20 cluster categories analyzed.
