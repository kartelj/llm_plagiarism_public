The research conducted within this thesis served to define the algorithms and software structures of adaptive systems that can be applied in the field of traffic regulation at light-signaled intersections. A model for the calculation of the signal plan for four-way intersection, regulated by traffic lights, with two or more stages at which traffic can take place under conditions of unsaturated (non-congested) and saturated (congested) traffic flows, has been established. A special analysis was conducted, as well as testing of functionality of suggested adaptive systems for traffic regulation in cases when there are emergency vehicles passing through the intersection, and when such vehicles are in the dilemma zone.
