Missing stock, or 'stock-outs,' constitute one of the foremost challenges within the retail industry as they directly impact sales, lower profit margins, and risk losing customers. Despite the 'stock-out' rate noticeably varying dependent on differing retail chain operational methods and the influence of numerous factors, the worldwide average still sits between 5-10%. This level of stock shortage can engender a financial loss of approximately 4% of a retailer's overall turnover. This study sought to analyse all the key elements that might escalate occurrences of stock-outs in the retail sector, alongside how automated ordering systems might mitigate such challenges. We considered the organizational, operational, and technological facets of the stock-out issue in our literary review. Assessing the complexities of the stock-out status and various concepts of automated retail ordering systems afforded us essential prerequisites for measuring the efficacy of automated ordering systems. This research project aimed to identify how different stock-keeping unit (SKU) features impact the stock depletion rates in the retail industry. Furthermore, it examined if an automated ordering system can address the challenges associated with SKUs regarded as risky. The data comprised a sample obtained from a prominent Serbian retailer, incorporating two high-risk product categories totaling 115 items across 97 stores, tracked over one calendar year. To identify occurrences of stock-outs, we used a continuous inventory compilation method and used probit regression and t-test statistics to gauge the influence of SKU characteristics and performance of the ordering system. Preliminary analysis of the stock-out rate identified patterns in the fluctuations, such as weekly changes, discrepancies in SKU performances and product categories, contributing to a more comprehensive understanding of potential stock-out causes. We observed that factors like product availability in distribution centers, promotional activity, and sales velocity adversely affect stock-out rates. Conversely, when using an automated ordering system, a decrease in stock-outs was noted. However, retailer risk categories showed stronger sensitivity to promotional activities and sales speed. Our statistical analysis also demonstrated the superior efficacy of the automated ordering system than manual ordering systems concerning cheaper, promotional and faster selling items, as well as those with irregular sales; this was not evidenced in larger packaged items. However, when looking at the distribution center level, items ordered automatically did not exhibit significantly better performance than items ordered manually.
