These days, many swarm intelligence algorithms are effectively used to tackle various challenging optimization problems. They all share components like local search operator (exploitation) which is used around potentially valuable solutions and exploration operator (global search) that assists in evading local optima. These algorithms typically undergo initial testing on unconstrained, constrained, or high-dimensional standard test function sets. They can be enhanced, adapted, altered, hybridized, or merged with local search. The primary goal is to apply such metaheuristics to real-world optimization problems. 

The solution domains or search spaces for these difficult optimization problems can be diverse. Solutions might be real or integer number vectors, but they could also be more intricate structures. Accommodating different search spaces, swarm intelligence algorithms need to be adjusted which might include simple tweaks in the algorithm parameters or transforming the integer solutions by approximating the real solutions obtained. However, for certain search spaces, almost an entire redesign of the algorithm might be required, retaining just the guiding process or swarm intelligence aspect. 

In this dissertation, various swarm intelligence algorithms, their adjustments for different search spaces, and their applications to practical problems are discussed. The dissertation aims to analyze and adjust swarm intelligence algorithms based on the fitness function and search space. 

The dissertation includes a thorough review of existing implementations of these algorithms. It also encompasses a comparative analysis highlighting the weak and strong points of certain algorithms relative to others, together with research on adapting swarm intelligence algorithms for varying search spaces and their practical applications. 

The dissertation considers problems like support vector machine optimization, clustering with real solutions, digital image segmentation problems with integer solutions, and problems requiring specially structured solutions like robot path planning and minimum weight triangulation. Adapting swarm intelligence algorithms for varying search spaces, the dissertation illustrates their use in practical applications, tested on standard test data sets, and contrasted them with contemporary methods from literature. 

The successful assimilation of these algorithms for diverse search spaces yielded superior results in all instances in comparison to the methods outlined in the literature. Consequently, the dissertation concludes that it is feasible to adapt swarm intelligence algorithms for a wide range of search spaces, comprising complex structures, and attain superior results compared to methods found in existing literature.
