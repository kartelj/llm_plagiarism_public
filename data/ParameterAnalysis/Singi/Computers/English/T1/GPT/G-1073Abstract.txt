The thesis centers on examining various models of interoperability for e-business systems, utilizing a service-oriented approach to software development. The investigation covers various dimensions including standards, interoperability frameworks, enterprise information system architecture, ontologies-based semantic technologies, and service-orientation. By analyzing the existing condition, best practice approaches, and evolving trends, the dissertation offers solutions to interoperability issues. These solutions include an ad-hoc methodological framework for interlinking e-business systems, a universal meta-model for ensuring semantic consistency, as well as the description and identification of components in e-business systems. Additionally, it proposes a service-oriented architectural model that enables semantic interoperability of business procedures on an ad-hoc basis. The research was authenticated by enhancing interoperability and refining business procedures related to cultural heritage preservation. The results obtained have optimised the utilization of available data, documents, and illustrative resources referring to different types of cultural artifacts.
