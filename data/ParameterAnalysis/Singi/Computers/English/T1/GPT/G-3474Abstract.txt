"During the swift progression of information technology, it has found substantial use in the educational realm. Many educational bodies employ the DLS educational platform, often as an addition to conventional education systems. However, there's a growing count of global and national higher education institutions that have adopted this training approach, implementing distance learning schemes. The objective of this study was to exhibit the present status of top quality DLS e-learning systems. We examined the development of e-learning model designs and proposed potential future trajectories. The incorporation of learning management systems, intelligent tutoring systems, and adaptive educational hypermedia systems in education has facilitated the accumulation of vast information about student learning patterns. Learning Management Systems (LMS) are utilized to formulate, structure, execute, and administer online courses and training schemes, regardless of their specific time and location. Moodle (Modular Object Dynamic Learning Environment), an open-source system grounded on PHP modules installed on the Web server and MySQL, Postgres databases, is one of the most prevalent learning management systems. The focus was laid on enhancing student performance during exam processes and the technical attributes of the e-learning system which could contribute to the steady development of the system amidst the rapid transformations in information and communication technology infrastructure."
