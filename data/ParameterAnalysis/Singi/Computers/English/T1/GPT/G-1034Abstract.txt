'Mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs), autonomous networks comprised of nodes linked through wireless connections without any centralized control, are currently a major focal point in research due to wide-ranging application possibilities in fields such as military and emergency response. In these networks, each node functions both as host and router, exhibiting the capability to forward packets to other nodes. The regular changes in topologies due to node mobility create unique challenges that necessitate specialized routing protocols for effective functioning. The inability of conventional wiring network protocols to operate efficiently within MANETs underscores this requirement.

The primary aim of this thesis is to investigate present benchmark routing protocols for MANETs, contrasting various methodologies. Three primary categories of MANET routing protocols exist, namely: reactive, proactive, and hybrid; an exploration into their respective merits and demerits informs the proposal of a new routing protocol. This new proactive protocol, dubbed OLSR-BF, primarily relies on the extant OLSR routing protocol with modifications chiefly hinging on the utilization of the Bellman-Ford algorithm in determining shortest node-node distances within the network. A qualitative comparison with pre-existing AODV, DSDV, and OLSR routing protocols is undertaken to authenticate the designed protocol's performance and efficiency.'
