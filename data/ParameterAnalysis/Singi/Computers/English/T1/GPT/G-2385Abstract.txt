Day by day, we are seeing an increase in the number of mobile phone users. Looking back at the history of mobile devices, it's apparent that manufacturers have been developing extremely sophisticated devices rightly termed as smartphones. Our reliance on these advanced mobile phones, thanks to their enhanced capacities and their influence on our everyday lives, is continuously increasing. Smartphones serve multiple purposes like making calls, searching the internet, utilizing various services like SMS, MMS, and email, using cameras or GPS devices. 

However, the advancement in mobile technology has brought about the first security threats affecting the communication channels i.e., data transfer from sender to receiver. The absence of adequate security measures is making these devices susceptible to security threats. When mobile phone operating systems come into play, the issue becomes more complex. Each operating system, although beneficial to users, also brings along a fair share of security vulnerabilities. Considering the growing popularity of the internet via mobile devices, there are risks associated with secure communication and setting up communication channels. Therefore, anyone using mobile devices must seriously take into account mobile communication security. 

Open source projects offer developers ample scope to create their own solutions based on their ideas. Having access to an operating system's source code paved the way for an operating system that superseded all others to become a market leader in the mobile phone world - Android. Android quickly became popular among developers and beyond, being based on the Java programming language. It's an open platform for mobile devices, allowing modifications even at the system level. Hence, developers can design unusual kernel-based security mechanisms for this platform. 

The Android operating system is built on Linux and belongs to the Open Source Association. Over seven years, by the time this article was written, Android had advanced to version 7.0. This article analyzes Android security mechanisms, identifies certain deficiencies in the low-level security framework surrounding the system. Survey results suggest a lack of user awareness regarding mobile internet safety. Based on a comprehensive analysis of Android and its security mechanisms, suggestions have been made to elevate the security framework levels of Android. To improve security, measures were proposed by utilizing SE Linux. A comparison was made showcasing the differences between the Android Open Source Project (AOSP) and the submitted Security Enhanced (SE) Android system. The article concludes by discussing future areas of research.
