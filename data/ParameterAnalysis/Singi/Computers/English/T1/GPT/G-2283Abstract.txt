This study aims to assess the standard of competitiveness in the Serbian economy, evaluate the efficacy of its policies, and understand how the incorporation of clusters enhances regional competitiveness. A variety of methodologies were utilized, including those developed by the World Economic Forum, the Center for Strategy and Competitiveness, University of Stockholm, and the European Cluster Observatory. The analysis of how robust clusters contribute to regional competitiveness strived to determine the relationship between the power of regional clusters, gauged by the location quotient, and GDP per capita as a measure of productivity in five countries (commonly referred to as G-5): Hungary, Bulgaria, Greece, Romania, and Serbia. The statistical data employed was collected from the Statistical Office of Serbia, EUROSTAT, the World Economic Forum, and the European Cluster Observatory. The findings reveal that Serbian competitiveness indicators are deteriorating, particularly in comparison to countries at a similar level of development, and the measures to boost competitiveness are inadequate. In the G-5 nations, 13 out of the 20 cluster categories examined exhibited a positive correlation between the regional cluster power and regional competitiveness.
