The primary aim of this research is to develop a cohesive approach to semiotics and axiology, with a particular focus on its application to visual media, items, and practices that generate or encapsulate value. This study won't investigate every visual aspect individually, nor will it examine all linguistic expressions related to human value interest. Rather, it will suggest a fundamental approach for understanding the processes and rationales behind value creation, as well as the various expressions and words, both historic and modern, utilized in this discourse. 

This will involve devising a system for categorizing and interpreting sensory perceptions, with an emphasis on visual ones. Alongside a brief analysis of semiotics historic background, the resulting theory will offer fresh interpretations and technical terminologies for semiotics/axiology, elucidating and defining them before demonstrating their utilisation in evaluating four aspects - aesthetic, functional, ethical, and cognitive - of sensory perception, especially visuals. 

The research will also look at artificial phenomena construction processes, medium utilization, and visual art practices such as design and communication design, using historical examples. The research aims to demonstrate the process of semiotic differentiation, interpretation, and evaluation, which necessarily implies and relies on inherent dualities generated from a human-centered perspective, such as subject/object, real/unreal, true/false, pleasant / unpleasant, functional/dysfunctional, etc.

These value polarities are represented in technofacts spanning five historical phases: the Western Renaissance, pre-industrial, industrial, information, and post-information periods. The study will illustrate how these semantically-defined and culturally-influenced polarities tend to balance over time, often through revolutions and hierarchical shifts but also strive to maintain their structural integrity and syntactic continuity. This preservation follows a primary mathematical type of +/- polarity and will be demonstrated by analyzing historical examples that contributed to semantic shifts in polarity within a creative, innovative framework and increasing efficiency in value production and distribution.
