Digital image and image processing technology has significantly bolstered progress in the field of medicine. Utilising computers to process these digital images can greatly hasten diagnostic procedures by exhibiting minuscule tissue variances that the human eye fails to perceive. Various devices, including scanners, microscopes, and endoscopic capsules contribute to medical image processing by generating images through numerous sources such as X-rays, ultrasounds, and magnetic resonance technology. Continuous advancements in medical imaging technology have yielded high-resolution, three-dimensional anatomical and physiological images.

However, this progress also incites new challenges in medical image processing. These challenges often represent complex optimization problems that have effectively been addressed using nature-inspired algorithms, particularly swarm intelligence algorithms, over the past couple of decades. The application of these algorithms to specific medical digital image processing optimization problems warrants modifications and adjustments tailored to the individual problem.

This active research area has garnered considerable interest as evidenced by a substantial amount of scientific articles, professional articles, books, journals, and conference discussions dedicated to the topic. In this thesis, various swarm intelligence algorithms, including the bat algorithm, fireworks algorithm and firefly algorithm, have been applied to the optimization problems associated with retina image registration, brain MRI segmentation, bleeding detection in endoscopic capsule images, image compression, leukemia detection in microscopic images, and emphysema detection in CT lung images. These problems are distinct and require the algorithms to be adapted accordingly.

Tests were performed on modified swarm intelligence algorithms intended to aid medical digital image processing, using standard benchmark test images relevant to the problems being addressed. These proposed swarm intelligence algorithm-based methods for enhancing medical digital image processing were juxtaposed with other advanced algorithms from existing literary works. The outcome displayed superior results, indicating that optimisation problems associated with the analysis and processing of medical digital images might have more effective solutions if swarm intelligence algorithms are appropriately adapted and applied.
