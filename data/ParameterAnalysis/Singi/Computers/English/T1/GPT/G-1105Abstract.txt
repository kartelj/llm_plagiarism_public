This doctoral dissertation, titled "Laser Perception of Defined Objects, Commands Encapsulation, and Control Elements for the Modern Robotized Teaching Tool," presents a pragmatic structure for developing a modern, robotized education tool. The proposed system includes features such as laser-based object recognition on the robotized platform, multiple control modules, and an experimental thesis. The research focuses on three key areas: the design and fabrication of a laser sensor group, the development of a programmable control module and logic controllers, and the creation of a self-propelled robotized platform. While these modules can function independently, when combined into a complete set, they form an outstanding foundation for conducting experimental research.
