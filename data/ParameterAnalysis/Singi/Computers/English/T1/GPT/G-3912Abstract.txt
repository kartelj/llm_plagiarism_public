Types of tourism like accessible, access, barrier-free, and inclusive tourism, cater to consumers of all classifications. It's a relatively new concept in our domestic market that remains largely unexplored. However, globally, it's potential is well-acknowledged, with a lot of research and scientific studies focusing on it. This has led to modifying the tourism supply to cater to such clients. The challenge in the tourism industry is to create an atmosphere that can accommodate all users. Aligning with global trends and passing various laws and regulations to synchronize with EU legislation, guarantees these categories of clients equal participation in all social activities, including leisure time. Accessibility has to become an integral part of any responsible and sustainable strategic tourism policy, thus requiring national-level investments in all aspects of the tourism industry that affect accessibility. Being informed about and adjusting to regulations not only supports human rights, but also creates business opportunities. However, a shift in mentality and service delivery methods is essential. This study emphasizes the importance of providing hotel services that cater specifically to the needs of accessible tourism users. Implementing accessible services and environments can enhance the quality of hotel service, and in turn increase the competitiveness of tourism destinations. An analysis of survey results shows how Belgrade's accessible hotel management views accessible tourism. This study includes their attitude towards accessible tourism consumers, the range of provisions tailored for them, HR policies, and the promotion of accessible accommodation. The study was conducted to gauge the management's perception of the role accessible tourism plays in their business success.
