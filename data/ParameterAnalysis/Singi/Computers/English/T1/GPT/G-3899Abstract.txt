The doctoral thesis delves into modern challenges pertaining to cryptographic key exchange and user authentication within a confidential communication system. It undertakes a detailed examination of existing solutions in the research field while developing its own private communication system. The scholarly objective of the thesis is to enhance the protocol for the exchange of cryptographic keys, relying on electronic identification (eID). Evaluating the existing methodologies in the field was necessary to heighten the level of security during confidential correspondence, supporting the progression of its own system. Employing cryptographic methods that ensure confidentiality, authenticity, and integrity, coupled with steganographic methods for clandestine information exchange, users of the proposed system can swap confidential messages securely and efficiently. Upon scrutiny of the research outcomes, it has been determined that confidential use of cryptographic keys for exchange in electronic communication is justifiable.
