Studies indicate that end users have primarily shifted their focus from social networking to communication platforms (such as Viber, WhatsApp, FB messenger, Instagram, etc.). Artificial intelligence, coupled with the concept of digital transformation, plays a key role in the modernization of businesses across various industries. In the fight against COVID 19 and in creating innovative solutions that offer additional value, chatbots were introduced into the digital world. These are software that mimic human interaction, assisting users in obtaining the correct information and simplifying everyday services. Over the last ten years, significant advancements in communication platforms and networking technologies have opened up new technological possibilities for the employment of chatbots in different sectors, including e-commerce, customer service, marketing, and education.

Chatbots are software applications that emulate human conversation using artificial intelligence, engaging in dialogues with humans via text and voice messages using natural language understanding. They leverage AI to respond to and resolve user’s queries. Keeping up with current trends, a methodological framework is defined for developing modern chatbot architecture based on artificial intelligence for the future internet community. Therefore, the most significant challenge in developing an adaptive platform is to address the flexibility of integration, defining the chatbot’s independence from a single natural language understanding (NLU) service to ensure sufficient adaptability.

The proposed methodology offers a comprehensive procedure and combines different methodological approaches. The development process of an adaptive chatbot based on NLU is split into two main phases according to this defined methodology: project engineering and application engineering, each subdivided into activities. By separating these phases, a flexible platform for creating chatbots can be realized.

The paper proposes a scalable and extendable architecture for chatbots that supports diverse NLU services and communication channels. It describes the chatbots' logical and physical architecture. Independence from any NLU service is secured through suitable metamodels and their mapping rules.

The thesis establishes an independent framework to limit reliance on vendors that offer NLU and communication channel services. This allows autonomy from any single natural language understanding service and doesn't bind the solution to one such service. Instead, the proposed mechanism facilitates easy mapping and transition between new NLU services.

Lastly, an implementation of the suggested solution is presented through a case study. The Academic Digital Assistant (ADA) – the first educational project in the Balkans aimed at improving communication, saving time, and providing faster and more efficient services. ADA interacts with users through various messaging communication platforms and carries out several key tasks before sending a message to the NLU. Once the NLU analyses the text using machine learning techniques, it generates the intent and its entities, which are then sent back to the chatbot platform. This platform then uses a specific algorithm of intent, entities, and context to respond to the user in an appropriate format.

ADA, available 24/7, responds to frequently asked questions from students and potential students. It's equipped with over 250 solution scenarios for students' common enquiries. Examples of these scenarios include exam registration, changes of examiner, semester certification, information on teacher consultations, deadlines, academy rankings, lecture schedules, student ratings, events, service availability, academic environment, lecture and exam dates, academy activities, and other useful academic information.
