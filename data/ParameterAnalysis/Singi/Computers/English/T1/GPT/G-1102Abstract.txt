The systems, processes, structural, and object-oriented modeling approaches yield the best outcomes in design, development, and ICT security practices. Security processes turn inputs into outputs, aiming to enhance output values, tie together procedures and tools, and employ skilled and motivated individuals to carry out security tasks. Continuous evaluation and improvement of these processes is critical, particularly because owners, managers, and general users typically lack comprehensive security knowledge, and security technology and expert(s) come at a high cost. Several models and standards, including the Capability Maturity Model (CMM) and the System Security Engineering Capability Maturity Model (SSE CMM), have been formulated to gauge quality, track process maturity, and improvement progress. Various possibilities for expanded frameworks for process assessment and enhancement are indicated by comparative analyses on the correlation between standards and models stemming from system, process, or environmental perspectives. The CMMs that incorporate processes offer a unique and holistic framework for assessing and advancing different processes. The SSE CMM integrates project management and organizational process areas. Within the SSE CMM, process performance quality and maturity are measured by a specific metric that focuses on basic and generic practices performance and implementation requirements. This metric classifies capability and maturity levels into five active tiers. Following the SSE CMM model, the System Security Appraisal Method (SSAM) has been designed to not only discover but validate the performance and implementation of basic and generic practices. Testing the current ESS processes on three projects and proposed process improvement plans validate user acceptability and feasibility of the SSE CMM model and the SSAM approach to security process assessment and improvement for optimum security program development, security organization profiling, and other ICT security applications.
