We're observing mobile devices becoming an integral part of our daily lives, primarily due to social media and quick access to news. Just a decade ago, these devices had specialized uses, and their operational capability was much less than what we now experience. This evolution in mobile devices has fostered development in seemingly unrelated scientific disciplines such as telecommunications, electronics, software engineering, and internet technology. Nowadays, mobile devices essentially replicate the functionality of traditional computers, with plenty of room for future advancements. 

However, there are limitations in terms of energy autonomy and device independence, primarily due to current battery technology. Market demands call for quicker processors, more compact devices, and larger screens. Furthermore, access to mobile internet is crucial for optimum use of such devices. Therefore, device manufacturers must improvise, innovating ways to maintain all these functionalities while enhancing the energy efficiency and autonomy of the device. 

Efficient energy usage can be achieved through hardware and software improvements. Because internet usage drains significant power, this area necessitates optimization. The current mobile services framework has potential solutions, as most applications function based on master-slave communication with multiple servers. In other words, the amount of data transmitted between the application and server is immense. 

Whether it's simple messaging, weather forecasting, social networking, or online gaming, applications exchange complex data structures. In line with object-oriented languages, these data can be viewed as lists or sequences of class instances or objects. The process of converting these complex data structures into byte sequences suitable for transmission is called data serialization. 

This study presents findings on energy-efficient transmission of serialized data between servers and mobile devices. A testing environment was established where power consumption was measured while communicating with a server. These measurements were used to formulate a mathematical model, later endowed with functions that symbolise serialization time and serialized file size. This data was then used to create the experimental API-CBSaver, which selects the most efficient method for serialization and compression in real-time based on these mathematical models. The results from the API-CBSaver test provide insights on the approach to enhance energy efficiency.
