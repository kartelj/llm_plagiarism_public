Users of contemporary electronic systems are confident in the high level of protection for their personal information and resources. This confidence is based on the trust that the service provider has taken every precaution to prevent system failure. The complexities of protection and user administration often deter users from utilizing available services. To deliver the utmost professional care, communication systems have created their own defense mechanisms that can withstand all known types of cyber attacks. However, professional systems must strike a balance between functionality and user protection. They typically incorporate services into existing infrastructures and commonly use SSL / TLS protocol for protection, using known data such as usernames and passwords. Consequently, a balance is struck between functionality and safety, disregarding certain safety and authentication measures. This paper explores the potential of implementing a custom solution that maintains system functionality while introducing an alternative method of safe authentication. It details the development process and characteristics of solutions that adhere to these principles, thereby enhancing the reliability of SSL / TLS authentication across multiple channels.
