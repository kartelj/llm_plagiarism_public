Cloud computing security involves many complexities and dimensions, touching on network security, computer safety, data protection, legal compliance, and more. Despite its significant benefits, these security fears hinder its widespread application. A reliable way to secure data in the cloud is through cryptography. However, storing encrypted data in the cloud means it cannot be processed unless decrypted, exposing a security risk. Homomorphic cryptosystems are a potential solution, allowing data processing in an encrypted format that can only be decrypted by key holders. This is considered by many the pinnacle of cryptography. There's been considerable academic interest in advancing encryption methods to process encrypted data in the cloud. We've noticed a lack of exploration in the relationship between encryption methods and limited-resource systems, which have significant applications for everyday life. Our research examines the use of homomorphic encryption for secure cloud-based applications. 

Our thesis delves into cloud computing's history and definition, and uses mathematical tools to explain the cipher system's homomorphism concept. We also discuss using virtual file systems to enhance encryption key security. During our study, we proposed storing them on Smart Card devices, which we applied in Unix/Linux operating systems. We then detail our scientific contributions, describing the problem modeling with its simpler model proposal and its implementation on two platforms: Raspberry Pi and Android mobile phones. We observe the restrictions regarding the length of keys, the number of sensors, and the corrective model function's result length. We also cover parts of code development for Unix/Linux and Android systems. Finally, we outline our primary scientific contributions and suggest directions for future research.
