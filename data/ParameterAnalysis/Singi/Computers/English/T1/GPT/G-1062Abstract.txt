This dissertation focuses on exploring e-business systems interoperability models through service-oriented software development from various viewpoints. It examines standards, interoperability frameworks, enterprise information systems architecture, ontology-based semantic technologies, and service orientation. The dissertation illuminates the present condition, optimum strategies, and emerging trends, and presents solutions to interoperability issues. This includes a methodological framework for ad-hoc e-business systems connectivity, a universal meta-model for ensuring system semantic consistency, and the description and discovery of components in e-business systems. It also introduces a model of a service-oriented architecture for ad-hoc semantic interoperability of business processes. To verify the research, the dissertation presents improvements in business process execution and interoperability particularly in the realm of cultural heritage protection. The results have enhanced access to and usage of information, documents, and representative material relating to various types of cultural artifacts.
