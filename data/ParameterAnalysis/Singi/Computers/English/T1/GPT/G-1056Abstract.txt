The future is expected to see a significant shift in the field of information security, with advanced theoretical computer security to provide a revolutionary and fundamental change in the current paradigm. This shift will involve integrating comprehensive protection mechanisms, making them no longer susceptible to the computing power of potential attackers. Interestingly, the success of this innovation lies in the development of modern digital signal processing methods that would furnish ample information required by modern communication networks' physical layer. The creation and implementation of new protocols and encryption key exchange would harness purely random extraction, ensuring maximal length and imprecision. 

Biometrics is set to play a significant role in the field of reliable practices for authentication, proving crucial for cryptographic parameters. The source of digital signal processing for biometrics is indispensable for establishing maximum entropy authentication codes. Moreover, copyright management of digital content will rely heavily on digital seals, both visible and invisible, marking them crucial elements. Consequently, this transition opens up a new avenue in synthesizing general systems for information protection in both theory and practice.

This proposed thesis aims to identify, analyze, and develop a classification of digital signal processing sub-systems to address the emerging requirements stemming from these information protection advances in contemporary computer and communication systems. The primary focus will be on developing a new class of encryption key systems based on iris biometrics.
