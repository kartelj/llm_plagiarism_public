At the dawn of the 21st century, information technology (IT) became a crucial element in education. A significant challenge of this era was procuring the necessary tools and integrating IT into contemporary education. Many developing nations underutilize the exceptional capabilities of this technology primarily due to a lack of adequate technological infrastructure in schools and insufficient teacher training. The overwhelming majority of schools employ proprietary software from IT corporations, which are priced steeply. This research aims to introduce a fresh perspective on the subject of information systems and education, specifically, spotlighting the potentials and influences of Open Source Software (OSS). With cities like Munich shifting to OSS to significantly cut costs, this subject is gaining traction among professionals. Other EU countries are contemplating migrating their computing systems to OSS, with some already initiating the transition. It is crucial to examine this subject from diverse angles such as economic, technological, pedagogical, sociological, cultural, and legal standpoints, among others. This paper offers a comparative analysis between Microsoft Windows and Linux operating systemsâ€”an ongoing subject of debate regarding their practicality and superiority in the IT sphere. Furthermore, it investigates the technological rivalry between open-source and proprietary software code, considering their origin and developmental philosophy. To demonstrate the compatibility of these systems on similar hardware as competing systems, we have conducted tests showing the feasibility of both systems on identical hardware architectures.
