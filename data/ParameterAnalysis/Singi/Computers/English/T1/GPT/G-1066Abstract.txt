The connection between supply and demand in the hotel industry is heavily influenced by the marketing efforts of hotel establishments. This article analyzes Serbian hotels, notable for their diverse array of amenities and services, as they differentiate themselves not only among one another but also from their competition worldwide. Recent investments into these hotel facilities have resulted in a revamped appearance for 4 and 5 star hotels in Serbia, characterized by contemporary design, sophisticated surroundings, and up-to-date accommodations. This study is set to examine the current status of Serbian 4 and 5 star hotels on the social networking platform, Facebook, and look into the prevalence and relevance of Internet Distribution Systems (IDS) in sales, also assessing their bearing on the standard of hotel services. The paper will highlight the transformations brought about in the hotel sector due to the advent of IDS, and its correlation with the Serbian hotel industry. Two empirical studies were conducted, and the respondents were middle and upper managerial personnel, and guests who have previously lodged in the hotels under survey. Data gathered was assessed with IBM SPSS Statistics 22 statistical software, using expressive statistics, Student's t test, chi square test, Importance Performance Analysis, and variance Analysis (ANOVA). Secondary data utilized for studying promotion was analyzed using Simply Measured tools.
