The concept of using electricity transmission lines to carry telecommunication signals extends back to the 19th century. The significant investment in traditional telecommunication technologies led to the study and formation of Power Line Communication (PLC). Over the years, PLC frequency band (between 3kHz to 148.5kHz) has been normalized, and the narrowband two-way PLC communication has become widespread in fields such as remote reading of electricity meters and consumption management. Hence, PLC technology serves in providing communication services at the accessibility level, directly to the consumer - the electricity users. 

In recent times, numerous modern telecommunication technologies and services are offered by telecommunication operators to their users, who also happen to be electricity consumers. Electricity distribution companies and PLC equipment manufacturers have recognized their interest over the last 15 years, investing in the development of Broadband PLC communications involving a frequency band from 1.6MHz to 30MHz. This enables achieving high data rates (theoretically up to 200 Mbps) to support broadband services such as VoIP, VoD, and high-speed internet. Electricity distribution companies can diversify their services and become more competitive in the free electricity market sector by expanding towards this area.

This paper outlines the challenges and restrictions that arise before Broadband PLC Communication (BPL) is fully commercialized, as well as suggesting technical solutions to overcome these issues. It also presents a specific project proposal and evaluation of indicators to validate the applicability of BPL technology for executing the access telecommunication level and providing broadband services to users. 

This research comprises 10 chapters - after introducing the research topic, the second chapter deals with various power lines and their characteristics for providing telecommunication services. The subsequent section discusses PLC system components and their impacts on PLC communication performance. Different topologies of low-voltage electricity distribution networks are classified in the fourth chapter, which also describes the organization of PLC access networks. 

The fifth chapter categorizes and specifies various interferences in low voltage and medium voltage networks that affect PLC or BPL communication. It also introduces modulation techniques used in PLC systems. Chapter six observes traffic switching techniques within PLC systems and identifies an efficient MAC protocol for PLC access networks. Within the same context, the seventh chapter describes the types of multimedia content to be transmitted over broadband PLC networks and associated QoS requirements. 

Chapter eight describes BPL communication limitations, both technical and regulatory. For instance, BPL communication interferes with other telecommunication systems using the same frequency spectrum. Chapter nine presents a project to identify indicators for evaluating the suitability of BPL technology for implementing telecommunication access level and providing broadband services. The final chapter is a comprehensive conclusion.
