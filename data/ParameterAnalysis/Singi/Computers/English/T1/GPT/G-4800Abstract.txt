Today's two primary technologies are generally considered to be the Internet of Things (IoT) and blockchain. Greater flexibility in applications housed on remote devices has been a result of decreased delays and improved system connectivity. Despite this, the IoT faces significant challenges such as limited computing resources, sparse memory, and less potent processors designed to keep energy consumption at a minimum, in addition to poor interoperability, security flaws, privacy concerns, and the absence of uniform standards. The issues pose roadblocks to executing robust encryption algorithms. 

In this study, we put forth the idea of employing a software interface as a security gateway structure for intelligent devices. This security interface promotes the use of stronger cryptographic algorithms in servicing smart devices remotely. This method strengthens the security of data transmitted by smart devices with the integration of matching data encryption algorithms prior to forwarding it to remote services.

Furthermore, it utilizes blockchain technology. Choosing to incorporate blockchain technology into the mix is to ensure the network of smart devices enjoys the benefits of decentralization and authentication. A greater level of anonymity and flexibility, currently lacking in IoT, is conferred through the integration of blockchain. Blockchain, with its concentrated control technologies, fortifies the interface, logs all transactions, verifies them, and thus establishes trust among devices on a singular network.

This research's outcome encompasses the creation of an interface capable of supporting smart devices to use any encryption algorithm, offers the capacity to map Internet Protocol (IP) addresses to deter unauthorized network access. Alongside the interface's development, blockchain technology will be integrated in a mode compatible with smart devices, factoring in their limitations in resources.
