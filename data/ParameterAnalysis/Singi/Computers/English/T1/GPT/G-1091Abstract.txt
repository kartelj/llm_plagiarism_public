The robust communication protection required by professional systems employed by agencies such as the government, military, and police cannot depend on the generally available protection systems. These systems cannot trust security systems developed outside their organization where the operations or potential vulnerabilities may be known to others. To achieve the utmost level of communication security, these professional systems must devise their own, resistant to all acknowledged forms of attacks. A comprehensive development of the communication system entails working on every aspect, from the user interface to the foundational communication infrastructure. This kind of development demands significant resources, investments, and appropriate time for development, testing, and rectifying errors. This text explores the potential use of existing public communication infrastructures and technologies to develop a system with the highest possible level of communication security. Additionally, the text presents a detailed process of development and features of the solution, focusing on the integration of proprietary ciphers at the network communication level.
