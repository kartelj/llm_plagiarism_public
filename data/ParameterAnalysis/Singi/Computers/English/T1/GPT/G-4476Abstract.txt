In order for cyber space to be secure, it's crucial to establish cryptographic algorithms which provide robust data and communication defense, endorse high-speed communication, need minimal processing resources, and have a compact setup. These features suggest a specific category of sequential cryptographic algorithms - the creation of pseudorandom generators possessing such traits. Considering these prerequisites, this study aims to develop a set of dependable and effective pseudorandom generators. A type of random processes, based on variable permutations, is described and the probability and statistical attributes of these identified random processes are examined. 

These defined processes serve as the foundation for characterizing a category of pseudorandom generators that are parametrized with dual pseudorandom sequences. Probability theory, information theory, and number theory are employed to probe the attributes of the defined pseudorandom generators. Conditions that activate the uniform distribution of output symbols in the output sequence of the pseudorandom generators are provided. 

Correlation analysis indicated that the sequence elements and the output sequence are asymptotically unrelated, implying that the output sequence element's information about the current internal generator state is asymptotically null. Further analysis showed that an appropriate selection of sequence parameters significantly extends the output sequence period compared to the sequence parameters. These are essential attributes of cryptographic pseudorandom generators. 

The suggested configuration's efficiency is due to its compactness and the selection of efficient pseudorandom sequence parameters, such as sequences formulated by multiple linear shift registers. Finally, potential applications for this proposed category of reliable pseudorandom generators are outlined.
