This paper introduces a unique method for cryptographically secure biometric authentication, utilizing public key cryptography, a pseudo-random number generator, and cancelable biometrics. The biometric templates are encrypted or rendered cancelable at every stage except for the feature extraction process, which enhances the security against various types of attacks. Furthermore, the system does not require intense computational work, and the biometric template sizes are feasible. This new method for cryptographically secure authentication is exemplified in a modular mobile banking system for user verification based on iris recognition. Both the system's performance and the randomness of the biometric templates, plus the data that is transferred over the network, are positively assessed based on realistic data.
