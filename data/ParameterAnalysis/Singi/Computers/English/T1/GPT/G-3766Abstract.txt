This thesis aimed to evaluate the conditions of patients with neuro-motor diseases using health care sensor networks and investigate whether tennis serves as a more effective rehabilitation method than standard reeducation processes. Another related goal was to highlight the growing risks faced by such sensor networks, which is a critical aspect to monitor. The thesis compared the rehabilitation of two patients of roughly identical age, strength and physique – one undergoing standard rehabilitation and the other using tennis as a therapeutic sport. It also contrasted the whole group's progress, with a control group. Furthermore, the study analyzed the health care sensor networks, their defence mechanisms, and their secure deployment. The findings revealed that the patients who used tennis for their recovery showed quicker and superior improvement, with stronger stroke power at the research's end, compared to those undergoing standard rehabilitation. Hence, the study yielded successful results. My other hypothesis—that technological advancements are increasing the prevalence of safety lapses in different networks—was also validated.
