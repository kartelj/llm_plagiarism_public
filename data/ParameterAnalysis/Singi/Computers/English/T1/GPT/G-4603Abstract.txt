This dissertation delves into the performance evaluation of wireless transmission over α-k-µ-g and k-µ-g fading channels. It provides closed-form expressions for the received signal’s probability density function (PDF) and cumulative distribution function (CDF) for this specific channel type. We have procured standard performance metrics such as outage probability (OP) and level crossing rate (LCR) for this specific transmission scenario, based on several system parameter values. We also assessed potential enhancement of these performance metrics when space diversity is employed at the reception stage. We scrutinized several space diversity techniques including selection combining (SC) and maximal-ratio combining (MRC) in an attempt to lessen the impact of fading. We further discussed the simultaneous presence of multipath fading and shadowing, and considered the use of macro-diversity and micro-diversity reception combining to offset these adverse effects and enhance the received signal quality. The results garnered from this dissertation confirm that our proposed methodology ensures a reduction of the damaging effects of α-k-µ-g and k-µ-g fading in various wireless transmission contexts.
