The W3C put forward XML as a standard for use across web applications, transactions, database systems, documentation, and information exchange over the Internet. XML allows diverse data storage, independent of its display and is commonly used to create, update, and query databases. Creating and writing XML documents, both for human and machine understanding, is particularly straightforward, making applications that process them easy to develop. Generally, XML documents can express any form of information. 

The Internet has seen a significant surge in Arabic content and users in the recent period. With a population of over 375 million speakers, Arabic is spoken widely across the globe. More than 40% of these speakers, or over 155 million people, access the Internet. This population accounts for about 5% of the total number of Internet users worldwide. From 2000 to 2015, the number of Arabic-speaking Internet users increased sixtyfold. 

Despite the rapid increase in Arabic content, information retrieval systems, summary generation of Arabic text, query processes, and natural language processors have lagged behind. The complex Arabic language, with its different syntax and morphological forms, presents unique problems for text processing, document summarizing, and information retrieval systems. Major losses in data often occur during querying, data summation, and information retrieval processes, particularly with bigger documents.

This dissertation outlines a system called RAX, engineered to rank Arabic documents in information retrieval actions. The proposed solution essentially hinges on the textual content's similarity. The designed model can handle documents composed in Arabic, stored in various formats. Due to the intricate linguistic semantics of Arabic, a purely statistical approach is used. The design and implementation leverage existing text-processing frameworks and reference Arabic grammar.

Our research centered on assessing different similarity measures to classify Arabic documents from various domains and categories based on user-provided query criteria. Additionally, the thesis examines RAX system security. Security considerations include XML security (XML digital signature and XML encryption) and SOAP messages for creating secure environments between the RAX system model and end-users, as well as examining potential security threats and countermeasures.
