The intricate nature of the adaptive e-education process is such that not much research has been conducted on its methodology, as well as the development of an integrated e-education system. As such, this paper holds unique importance and contributes significantly to the field. E-education is a multi-faceted system that encompasses distance learning and teaching, a variety of teaching materials, independent and group learning, tutoring, and interactive work. It is crucial to take into account each student's preferences and learning styles to enhance the performance of e-education systems. Various data are utilized to identify these preferences, including those from business information systems, distance education systems, surveys, and teacher evaluations. These data allow for system adaptation, where changes are made based on the student's system knowledge. Some primary objectives of e-education system adaptation include refining the course design and usability, fostering student loyalty, facilitating information finding, and promoting advanced searching and contextualization of search results based on student interests. This dissertation proves the hypothesis that incorporating an adaptive model within the Learning Management System (LMS) can augment the educational process, elevate business process quality in e-education, and validate the costs of effectuating such a model. Implementing the developed adaptive model can help resolve issues associated with remote learning, such as tailoring teaching materials to students' needs and developing a quality reporting system and an electronic learning portal based on LMS data. This can increase student enrolment and graduation rates, reduce costs, optimise fund usage, and facilitate better decision making. This doctoral dissertation delves into the application of adaptive methods in e-education with the goal of creating an adaptive model for an internet programming course. Experiments were conducted in the form of an adaptive JAVA programming course at the Informatics laboratory of the Professional Studies College of Technology in Sabac, Serbia. Standard statistical methodologies were used to measure relevant parameters and analyze results, demonstrating that students who participated in the adapted course achieved better outcomes than those in the non-adapted course.
