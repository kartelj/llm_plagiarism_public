The Distance Learning System (DLS) is an emergent educational concept that's quickly gaining widespread acceptance. The foundation of this method lies in its tutoring system and its various modules (assistant module, tutor module, emotion recognition and tracking modules, motivational modules, etc.) These modules interact in concert with the system's feedback information. The DLS's modular design is crucial, primarily for its correctional roles, adaptivity, automation, and self-adjustment.

The DLS's emergence has facilitated the straightforward implementation, widespread usage, and improved functionality of contemporary Learning Management Systems (LMS). LMSs are utilized for creating, structuring, executing, managing, and assessing classes related to educational environments. Preparing for these classes involves acknowledging the unique traits of students or student groups, categorizing them based on predilections, prior knowledge, and inclinations. That is, it's critical to know each student's individual traits, tendencies, and abilities. 

During class enrollment and classes, particularly while grappling with complex math problems, misunderstanding and ambiguity are inevitable. This leads to a range of emotions, distraction, dips in concentration and motivation. At this point, the DLS and its modules indicate any irregularities and any declines in study quality which may not align with the individual needs of each student. Corrections to such issues should be made with the module of correctional functions. Hence, itâ€™s critically important to identify student traits and valid educational environment factors from the outset.

Each student or student group should be assigned an appropriate combination of DLS modules to ensure successful class monitoring and effective course evaluation. All the various factors that define the educational environment must be formally established with consequential effect weighting coefficients. Reflecting on this, building mathematical modules founded on two information types is essential for grading each student in the distance learning program correctly. The first information type encapsulates input information such as grade point average, prior subject grades, and student motivation levels, etc. The second information type bases its evaluations on the emotional responses students show when faced with course-related tasks and assignments. 

In addition to this, it's necessary to develop mathematical models for multi-criteria grading of various DL study platforms. The ultimate aim here is to ensure the best educational outcomes for each student or student group by aligning situations with the teaching process. Occasionally, this multi-criteria grading isn't feasible due to the method's own structure, necessitating custom grading methods for specific educational contexts in order to achieve optimal results.
