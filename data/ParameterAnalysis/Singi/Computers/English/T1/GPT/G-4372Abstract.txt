Modern companies are continually grappling with an overwhelming amount of data and information, which complicates business operations and decision making. They need to effectively employ management knowledge to enhance business operations. Increasingly, businesses are focusing on safeguarding their organizational memory (company knowledge), its distribution, and management. It's become essential to incorporate the concept of management intelligence, which helps manage the organizational memory successfully, into business strategies. 

Embedding automated organizational memory management, although complicated, offers a solution for the interplay of knowledge management and information technology. It simplifies the decision-making process and the flow of documentation, data, and information for a company. Also, with automated memory management, the business can gain detailed data, which acts as a foundation for informed decision making. However, this calls for the protection of such an integrated automated process. 

In consonance with international standards like ISO 27001, such systems' management should provide a framework for establishing, operating, monitoring, reviewing, maintaining, and enhancing the memory security management system of the organization. An optimum balance should be struck between user requirements, functionality within the system, and the need to protect sensitive data and preserve its integrity through cryptographic solutions.

This integrated automated process of memory management finds use in intelligent learning systems and modern business decision-making systems alike. Adding digital signatures ensures the indisputability of documents and their immutability, consistent with the existing legal regulations for electronic documents. 

One of the proposed ways to safeguard organization memory management's integrated system is to allow their recording in encrypted forms, with data accessibility confined to the company's information system. Access to data and documents would be restricted to explicitly authorized system users. The paper will delve into the organization's unique cryptographic solution for memory protection from a knowledge management perspective. It will discuss various principles and models that offer both data protection and privileged access to data, intending to facilitate decision-making based on organization memory. Security information agencies serve as ideal examples for such analysis, showcasing instances of both well-functioning systems and lapses.
