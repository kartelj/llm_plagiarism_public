Research on the interaction between humans and computers integrates multiple scientific disciplines, including computer science, psychology, social studies, cognitive sciences, and design. This research utilizes modern interfaces that can accommodate a wide range of sensors such as the mouse, keyboard, eye trackers, EEG devices, pulse monitors, and heart rate monitors. 

The focus of the research is the human-computer interaction, specifically the utilization of artificial intelligence in analyzing and assessing participants' cognitive performance. Owing to its capabilities in surpassing human data processing speeds, the system can deliver real-time feedback, thus participating actively in the interaction. 

An artificial intelligence model for compiling and analyzing human-computer interaction data was demonstrated via four cognitive performance evaluations of participants, using neuropsychological tests - Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST), Visual Short Term Working Memory Test (VSTWMT), mTutor Test and the AC Test. 

Individual client applications, able to connect to sensor applications through the Synchronization Platform (HCI-MAP), were developed for each experiment. Data collection equipment included an EEG device, an eye tracking device, and a computer mouse. Results from these evaluations pointed to some variances from reference values, however, they provided valuable insights into participant performance and behavior. 

Our research also delved into the effect of altering the question type, where it was concluded that the emotional state of subjects can be influenced, thereby impacting their performance. 

The AC test evaluated the level of attention, differentiating between important and distractive stimuli. The presence of a high correlation between the gaze position and mouse cursor movement was noted. 

The findings indicate that the application of artificial intelligence in the analysis of human-computer interactions can potentially yield comparable, or perhaps superior results than traditional human analysis. Furthermore, machine-led analysis can gauge cognitive performance of users in a distributed system providing real-time feedback.
