Creating high-quality random number sequences is the most critical aspect of any cryptographic system, and the design and verification of these generators necessitate a meticulous approach. The quality of these sequences largely depends on the randomness source of entropy and the post-processing procedures used. Post-processing enables the digitization of random analog signals, resulting in a series of genuinely random numbers of uniform distribution.

This dissertation discusses existing methods of random sequence generation using a sound card as well as presents a new class of generator. Random number sequences are essential in numerous areas, such as cryptography, gaming, simulation, decision making, medical, aesthetic, and artistic spheres. The pseudorandom number generator (PRNG) has been commonly used and generates a deterministic, periodic array of values determined by an initial state, referred to as SID. However, True random number generators (TRNGs) rely on unpredictable natural phenomena like sound noise, radioactive decay, thermal fluctuation, photoelectric effects and various quantum phenomena, producing non-periodic true random numbers.

Despite numerous pieces of research optimizing random numbers generated by sound cards - which often depend on PRNGs or their structures, this dissertation develops a novel approach for producing true random bits using computer hardware's sound card affected by random signal noise in the environment, as well as post-processing (distillation) with a new process, mixing the input string and XOR-ing neighboring bits (Mibis & XOR). 

This approach facilitates an efficient and easy separation and removal of correlated adjacent bits of the input string. Subsequently, the XOR-ing of the neighboring bits of the newly obtained set decreases autocorrelation, increases entropy, and reduces output bits set bias. Randomness statistical testing revealed that this class of generators possesses excellent characteristics, generating true random numbers of high random quality very quickly. 

The dissertation's first part (Chapters 2 & 3) presents the theoretical basis needed to understand the second part where original contributions are detailed. Chapter 2 introduces the concepts of the random process, random signal, and stochastic signal sources as essentials needed to generate a truly random sequence. Chapter 3 provides basics of sound cards and environmental noise signals.

The second part (Chapters 4 & 5) reveals original research results. Chapter 4 shares results achieved in developing new methods of generating random sequences and the necessary characteristics of true random number generators. Chapter 5 discloses results from applying the novel distillation techniques. A significant portion is dedicated to the development of effective, fast, efficient, cost-effective, and accessible to many random number generators.

The emphasis has been placed on developing efficient random sequence generation methods using everyday devices such as desktop computers, laptops, tablets, and smartphones. The discussion shows that an effective system is available; able to quickly produce random values with sufficient unpredictability, thus making it suitable for use in a vast array of applications. The results achieved support the future development of hardware and software-environment for improving random sequence generators.
