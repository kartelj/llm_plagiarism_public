This doctoral thesis proposes an innovative fingerprint biometrics encryption system, which is built around the fuzzy commitment scheme and deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The unique aspect of this study lies in the new methodology for automatically discretizing fingerprint texture descriptors, a mechanism that relies solely on CNNs and aims to formulate fixed-length templates. The two-bit coding used in the suggested quantization of the derived features transforms these biometric templates into a binary domain. This enables the use of XOR biometrics, leading to creation of a biometric encryption system that can serve key-release purposes or be used as a protective mechanism for templates in fingerprint matching systems. The issue of variable biometric data is addressed by applying the secure and attack-resistant, block-level Bose–Chaudhuri–Hocquenghem error correction codes. The suggested biometric cryptosystem can handle a key length of 265 bits, making it compatible with contemporary cryptographic systems, and possess a satisfactory 1% EER. Evaluations indicate substantial performance enhancement in comparison to other texture-based fingerprint matching and biometric encryption systems.
