The Ph.D. dissertation titled "Posthuman Gaze: Automated Images in Contemporary Cinema" investigates how contemporary cinema utilizes automated images as an expressive tool via the lens of new cinema modes in the digital era. In the digital age, moving images are ubiquitous and their origins are often untraceable. These images are autonomously and algorithmically produced by devices like our computers, gadgets or surveillance systems. The dissertation will analyze the impact these seemingly random automated images have on contemporary cinema. Cinema as an art form, as such, will be approached with transdisciplinary considerations.

The dissertation aims to examine how postcinematic culture - which experiences radically different power relationships due to technological advancements in film production and viewing - portrays the correlation between human beings and their surrounding societal, neoliberal, technocentric environment, closely tied to posthumanism.

The dissertation's structure begins with an introduction detailing its methodological foundation which combines theoretical and empirical research via a review and analysis of various theoretical frameworks following an interdisciplinary approach. The first chapter establishes theoretical frameworks for automated image concepts. The second chapter places automated image within the context of posthumanist studies, while the third chapter clears up terminology and provides structural groundwork for analyzing automated images as a film medium. The next three chapters focus on specific case studies which analyze automated images in contemporary cinema including surveillance films, computer screen films and landscape films, seen as new film genres and trends.

These case studies suggest a growing trend to dismantle traditional film narrative by adopting non-conventional methods to align with current screen culture, thereby necessitating a new perspective on modern visual regimes. As such, the dissertation serves as a critical tool to understand modern digital cinema trends in the context of posthumanism.
