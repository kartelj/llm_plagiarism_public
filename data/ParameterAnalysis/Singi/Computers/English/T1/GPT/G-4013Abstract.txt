'This doctoral thesis explores a technologically efficient and societally applicable solution to the problem of guaranteeing the identity of each newborn. The relevance of this issue has greatly increased due to rising doubts about possible baby swapping or theft in Serbian birthing centers. A considerable number of lawsuits, particularly those from the International Court of Law in Strasbourg, France, have also highlighted this problem. The proposed solution involves a unique, patented device for biometric identification of parenthood, using fingerprint minutiae, and an authentic distributive information system. This system and device ensure synergy and efficiency, delivering real-time proof of identity for every newborn with 100% accuracy, while also confirming parental rights. Particular emphasis is placed on the security aspects of the system, given the sensitivity of the data involved. Standalone algorithms have been developed to verify the mother and baby's identity at birth and departure from the birthing center and determine the optimal timing for these procedures. Cancelable biometrics are incorporated to safeguard against data corruption or breaches of safety. The implementation of this system is set to significantly improve this aspect of the Serbian healthcare system, benefiting all stakeholders - healthcare institutions and citizens alike. It will eliminate human error entirely and streamline many procedures within the existing system for recording newborns. This thesis will present a system that prevents any possible misidentification, swapping or theft of newborns, thereby enhancing the speed and quality of service to ensure that every baby is unequivocally linked to their parents in real-time conditions.'
