This thesis' research focused on outlining the algorithms and software structures of adaptive systems applicable for regulating traffic at intersections with traffic lights. A model was created for computing the signal plan for a four-way intersection, regulated by traffic lights, with multiple stages allowing for traffic movement under unsaturated (non-congested) and saturated (congested) traffic conditions. Furthermore, a thorough analysis and functionality testing were carried out on the proposed adaptive traffic management systems for scenarios involving emergency vehicles passing through these intersections and when these vehicles are in the so-called 'dilemma zone'.
