The urgency to ramp up data-transfer rates of multimedia, coupled with modern society's heightened need for copyright protection, is increasingly evident. In this vein, Free Space Optics (FSO) communications are a credible substitute to traditional wireless communication systems. In regions where they can be deployed, these systems offer exceptionally high performance for users, present a virtually high security option, and provide data rate transfers of a few Gbs. Their cost-effective implementation, especially in "last mile" connections, proves significant and practical. This study delves into the feasibility of transmitting images through an FSO communication channel amidst scintillation. It further examines the transmission of copyright-protected data (watermarked images), the effect of FSO channels on their degradation or their protection code, and the detection of fires on color images post their transmission over FSO communication channels.
