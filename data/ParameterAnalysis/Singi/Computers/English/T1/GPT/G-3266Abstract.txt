Current studies in the realm of automatic speaker recognition highlight how deep learning neural network-based methods outperform other statistical classifiers. However, these methods typically require extensive parameter adjustments. This thesis aims to demonstrate that choosing the right parameter values can drastically enhance the performance of speaker recognition methods founded on deep learning neural networks. 

The presented research delves into an approach towards automatic speaker recognition relying on deep neural networks and the stochastic gradient descent algorithm. It emphasizes specially on three parameters in the stochastic gradient descent algorithm: the learning rate, and the dropout rates for hidden layers and input layers. Special attention was given to the problem of speaker recognition in noisy environments, and thus, two experiments were carried out. 

The first experiment endeavored to prove that optimizing the targeted parameters of the stochastic gradient descent algorithm can improve speaker recognition performance even in noise-free environments. Conducted in two phases, the first phase observed the recognition rate when the hidden layer dropout rate and learning rate varied, keeping the input layer dropout rate constant. The second phase watched the recognition rate with varied input layer dropout rate and learning rate, maintaining the hidden layer dropout rate constant.

The second experiment set out to show how optimizing the analyzed parameters of the stochastic gradient descent algorithm can enhance speaker recognition performance in noisier conditions. Different noise levels were artificially incorporated into the original speech signal. 

The derived results indicate that dropout optimization can considerably escalate the performance of the stochastic gradient descent method in automatic speaker recognition, even in noisy circumstances. Furthermore, identifying an appropriate value for the learning rate was found to be crucial since specific values can stunt the performance of the method.
