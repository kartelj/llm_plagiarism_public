Continuous access to enhancements in product, service, and software quality allows organizations to adapt flexibly to rapid changes typical in today's market economies. It's through the ongoing betterment of the quality of these entities that a business can retain its competitiveness. Achieving quality improvement is contingent on managing all process input elements that have an impact on quality. In this paper, the concept of product, defined here as 'the outcome of a particular process', will include: 1) product; 2) service, and 3) software. This work will present a methodology for creating and assessing user requirements and identifying process input elements. These elements significantly impact whether these needs are met, making product quality management complex. It's common to find a plethora of alternative solutions to boost product quality. Each enhancement method will carry a cost implication and a unique influence on the product's quality. While it's fairly straightforward to establish the implementation costs for each solution, it can be difficult to determine how improving a certain factor will affect product quality and user satisfaction. What challenges remain is to discern the most beneficial mix of quality-influencing factors under a limited budget. What, then, will be the effect of refining factors that influence product quality? To examine the impact of improving these factors on the final product's compliance with user requirements, this paper will employ the use of Markov processes in a Matlab programming environment to simulate product conformity. This dissertation materially contributes to the improvement of modelling methodologies for managing factors that influence product quality. Moreover, it presents a valuable societal contribution, providing solutions to practical issues in business systems relating to process quality improvement. The outcomes of this study can guide decision-making towards enhancing product quality.
