This paper explores the retrieval of information from multimodal business documents within a desktop setting. A document presents information through several modalities such as text, layout/style, and images. For instance, journal articles often include figures to demonstrate experimental outcomes, and journal article titles typically use a different font size compared to the main body text. Traditionally, Information Retrieval (IR) entails indexing and retrieval utilizing only text. However, as the internet and digital libraries evolve, creating more sophisticated techniques for indexing and retrieving multimodal documents has become increasingly vital. Indexing and retrieval form vital aspects of an IR system. Taking a document collection, indexing represents documents in an index language, while retrieval leverages indexing results to find documents relevant to a user's query. Text and image modalities require distinct methods for indexing and retrieval. Single-modality IR, whether using text or images, presents certain drawbacks. The purpose of multimodal IR is to overcome each of the limitations in single modalities via their integration.
