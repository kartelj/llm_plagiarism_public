This thesis introduces a type of systems designed to create and share cryptographic keys, relying on different biometric modalities. The theoretical structure includes two biometric modalities: fingerprints and irises. The system operates by using the hash values garnered during the beginning stage, also known as the enrollment phase. Auxiliary data further strengthens the revocability of the biometric data, thus safeguarding the privacy of such data. It also provides added security for cryptographic parameters. Iris biometrics, known for having the most biometric information, is used to derive a secret key, while fingerprints are utilized for verification purposes. The research aspect of this dissertation was thoroughly explored through experimental analysis, which was largely based on samples drawn from the CASIA biometric database. The experimental results that were attained show substantial contributions that could notably enhance the functionality of this system.
