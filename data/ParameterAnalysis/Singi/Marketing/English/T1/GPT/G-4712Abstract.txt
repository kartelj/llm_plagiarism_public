The thesis delves into a relatively untapped area, studying the impact of printing and packaging processes on the properties of printed flexible packaging materials, with the inclusion of their value assessment via suitable multicriteria evaluation methods. Experimental investigation of these materials resulted in evaluating and contrasting their change measures. The research set constraints chiefly concerning chosen types of packaging materials and types of packaged content. This assessment culminates in a clear total of individual variant values for printed flexible packaging materials, allowing for the calculation of each material's sufficiency in meeting individual food product requirements.
