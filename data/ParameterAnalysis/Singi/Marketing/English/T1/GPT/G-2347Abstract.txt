This dissertation investigates the effects of water usage in farming within Libya, and the ensuing ecological repercussions. Libya predominately consists of dry, arid terrain with Sahara desert occupying about 95% of its landscape. The majority of its cultivatable and grazing land is situated in the northern section along the thin Mediterranean coastal line. Water resources in Libya are scarce due to the limited surface water resources and other sources such as water desalination and wastewater treatment. The country, therefore, heavily relies on groundwater, which makes up approximately 95% of its water source. 

Agriculture contributes approximately 9% to Libya's GDP, consuming 85% of the overall water supplies and 12% of the electricity. This clearly shows inefficient and unsustainable management within the agricultural sector. The three ecological indicators selected to determine the environmental impact of water usage in farming are water consumption, land use, and water pollution. According to these indicators, environmental sustainability is poor as the agricultural water use index is significantly damaging to the environment especially in the densely populated northern region. Major environmental issues caused by agricultural water usage are the intrusion of seawater into groundwater, water pollution, and soil salinization. Also, excessive groundwater consumption in the southern region has resulted in a reduction in the upper layer groundwater levels leading to the drying up of some desert lakes. 

The thesis suggests a sustainable solution to curb water depletion by harnessing seawater as a renewable and sustainable water source. The idea revolves around using seawater for agricultural purposes within coastal deserts of Libya by utilising salt-tolerant (Halophyte) plants which are primarily used for animal feed. 

Several factors necessitate the exploitation of seawater including:
1. Limited supplies of underground water within coastal areas and its cross-contamination with seawater in several regions.
2. Inconsistent patterns of rainfall affecting the natural grassland adversely.
3. Overpopulation within coastal areas putting a strain on the meagre groundwater resources of the region.

To conserve non-renewable water resources like groundwater and surface water, the study proposes a sustainable approach through energy generation from the Great Man-Made River (GMR). Power is generated from water movement across the GMR pipeline using sized turbines. 

The thesis also proposes converting GMR into an expansive food production project by implementing multiple solar-powered seawater desalination plants to meet freshwater needs. This transition allows thousands of desert hectares around the pipelines to be transformed into a vast irrigated agricultural project. 

Another focus of the study is the transition from dependence on fossil fuels to the utilisation of renewable energy sources for power generation which is crucial to prevent further environmental pollution. While solar energy is a viable renewable energy source in Libya, the study investigates other sustainable, eco-friendly energy sources. Preference is given to energy generated from the movement of water across the GMR pipe and the movement of vehicles on roads (Smart Roads), contributing to economic and environmental security.
