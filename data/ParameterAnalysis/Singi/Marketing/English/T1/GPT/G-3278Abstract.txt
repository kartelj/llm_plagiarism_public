This study notes a shift in the cruise travel sector, with cruise companies placing greater emphasis on enhancing the quality of passengers' cruise experiences. The importance of this focus stems from the substantial influence the quality of the cruise has on a vacationer's overall satisfaction and subsequent behavior. This thesis aims to delve into the factors leading to and following a quality cruise experience.

The central concern is to gain a comprehensive understanding of the constituents of the cruise experience and to identify viable ways to measure these factors and their aftermath. In this context, the author adopts an integrative method, assessing the service theater model (cruise ship performance) and service quality facets. These elements can subsequently be employed to design quality cruise experiences effectively.

The research findings adhere to postmodernism, postpositivism, and interpretivism philosophies, employing suitable quantitative and qualitative data gathering methodologies. The research strategy combines inductive and deductive methods, aligning with these philosophies.

Structural equation modeling was utilized to assess the conceptual model. The findings corroborate that employees, guests, service settings, and service quality are preliminary factors of the cruise experience. However, only evoked emotions had a positive influence on overall gratification and dictated future actions.

Academic interest in the nature of the cruise experience remains relatively elusive. Hence, it can be argued that this research adds to the ontology of the quality of the cruise experience and enriches the theory regarding the same. The study was conducted onboard a cruise ship, interacting with guests, thereby encapsulating all aspects of practical application.

Given the provided data, research outcomes, insights, and suggestions that can be applied practically, we can argue that the study carries managerial significance.
