Modern retail is heavily influenced by dynamic business conditions, with growth dependent on the company's ability to rapidly and accurately adapt to market challenges. A rapid pace in retail demands an anticipatory stance against inventory shortages, as delivery delays can lead to lost sales, customer dissatisfaction, and ultimately a reduced competitive edge. This study aims to map out the influence of demand forecasting on the inventory management process, with the ultimate goal of creating a strategy for these two elements. The scientific and theoretical categorization of inventory management determinants were systematically examined in this context. The study underscores the relevance of multi-criteria demand management for inventory management efficiency. The main objective was to identify modern business conditions that drive demand and then model the effective implementation of forecasting methodology for stock management. A business that doesn't prioritize demand forecasting in inventory management is unsustainable in the long term. The study relied on data from Winwin Shop Čačak's retail store, predicting demand for four product categories across over 100 stores, accounting for over 40% of total sales. The findings suggest that demand forecasting is crucial for enhancing retail operation efficiency under modern business conditions. The multi-criteria method employed was the Analytical hierarchical process, backed by Expert Choice software for estimation and future product demand forecasting. While the results confirm the importance of demand forecasting in optimizing inventory and enhancing business efficiency, they also indicate that subjectivity in the prediction process can be reduced but not entirely eliminated.
