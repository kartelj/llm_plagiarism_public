The objective of this study is to examine the impact of various balance and off-balance sheet factors on the interest rate risk exposure of banks in both established and growing financial markets. The precise evaluation of this exposure aids in the identification, monitoring, and control of interest rate risk. We studied 65 bank holding companies from a matured financial market in the United States as a sample, and 10 banks from an evolving financial market in the Republic of Serbia, listed on the Belgrade Stock Exchange, were included in the sample. We carried out a comparative assessment of balance sheet characteristics' influence using Stone's regression model and the econometric panel model as a foundation. The findings from these models affirm that certain factors, specifically bank size and the proportion of deposits in total assets, have a significant but inversely proportional effect on banks in established and growing financial markets. In the US, as total bank assets grow, so does their vulnerability to interest rate risk, while the opposite is true in Serbia. An analogous contrast can be seen with the rise in deposit share in total assets: it lessens interest rate risk exposure in US banks, but has a different result in Serbian banks. Certain factors have similar effects, such as an increase in return on average equity (ROAE) and a decrease in net interest income, which invariably lessen the banks' exposure to interest rate risk, irrespective of the market's developmental stage.
