Serbia is playing a significant role in the process of assimilating with the European Union (EU) laws, specifically the European acquis, aligning their national policies with EU's technical legislations. Despite achieving good standards in waste management in compliance with EU’s directives, the country's practical application is still in its early stages. Nevertheless, progress can be seen in areas such as waste collections and sanitary disposal. Waste management is a key responsibility of the state, aiming to reduce environmental pollution and reuse waste more efficiently. EU's environmental protection laws are detailed and encompassing, but provide enough flexibility for member states to adapt based on their respective constitutional and institutional systems. The management of hazardous waste in Serbia lacks the necessary infrastructure to meet directives based on the EU's new, global approach. Assimilating new technologies for waste treatment and arranging professional training is a long and expensive process requiring national involvement. The state of hazardous waste management in Serbia demonstrates an absence of any kind of hazardous waste treatment locations. To address these challenges, this paper suggests a solution for the disposal and full destruction of hazardous waste, branched across numerous companies in Serbia. The proposed treatment plant’s focus would be the disposal of PCB oil, Ni-Cd batteries, and biodegradable waste, among other things. Alongside describing the current status of hazardous waste and related legal norms, the paper explains a business model showcasing how plasma technology can be employed for complete waste disposal and subsequent conversion of energy into heat and electricity, aiming to create a profitable structure.
