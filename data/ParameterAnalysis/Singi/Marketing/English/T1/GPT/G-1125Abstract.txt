For numerous decades, the configuration of the financial system has been experiencing notable transformations. These shifts are evident in the evolved importance of certain types of financial institutions, amalgamation of diverse groups of financial operations within complex institutions, and expansion in their activity scale and range. The considerable use of bank and other financial institution mergers and acquisitions plays a role in the restructuring of the financial sector. There is a substantial increase in banking institution mergers and acquisitions in developed EU nations, viewed as part of global phenomena like bank reconstitution and expansion, as well as the creation of a unified financial market triggered by the inception of the euro as the sole currency. Enhanced competitiveness in both the real and financial sectors is vital for bolstering bank mergers and acquisitions aiming to boost business efficacy and profitability in a globalized context. Bank mergers and acquisitions in developed EU nations usually involve a change of ownership amongst groups of private shareholders. However, in transition countries, transactions typically involve the acquisition of formerly state-owned banks, mainly by foreign banks from developed EU nations. The economic aspect of the transitioning banking sector includes improved efficiency and profitability of banks, application of contemporary financial technology, and the use of modern risk management methods. Successful execution of mergers and acquisitions requires suitable planning and assessment, as well as the implementation of an appropriate strategy for post-acquisition integration.
