The dissertation titled "Problems of Assessing Value of Small and Medium Enterprises in Different Life Cycle Stages" significantly contributed to the methodological understanding of connecting two unexplored aspects of business economy. In the introduction, the research's subject and goal were highlighted, including the challenges, hypothesis, methodology and anticipated research contributions. 

The first part of work, named "THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK: OVERVIEW OF CURRENT RESEARCHES IN THE FIELD OF INTERACTIONS OF DEVELOPMENT STAGES AND ASSESSING VALUE OF SMALL AND MEDIUM ENTERPRISES", underscored the significance of small and medium enterprises to the economic growth of a nation, particularly for countries navigating through transitional and post-transitional periods marked by mergers, reengineering, restructuring, and downsizing. Appropriate business strategies for SMEs can address these modern business environment risks. It suggested that each phase of a businessâ€™ development presents unique challenges that affect business value, establishing the need for investigation.

To successfully connect and examine these two areas, the dissertation separated the systematization of value assessment methods and SME development stage diagnostics within a methodological framework. The methodology for value assessment included an application of book value, yield value and liquidation value evaluation methods. The procedures for development diagnostics included models for identifying metamorphosis, behavioural shifts, and structural changes.

The second part of the paper titled "Methodological Framework: Overview of Current Methodology in the Field of Interaction of Development and Value Assessing of Small and Medium Enterprises" considered the choice of the St.Gallen methodological framework and provided an overview of four models of development. 

In application, the classifications of 55 sample SMEs were examined, with 15 excluded as their phase of development was unclear. The remaining 40 were categorized into four standard phases, with each phase engaging ten SMEs. The book, yield and liquidation values of each enterprise were determined.

The third segment of the paper titled "APPLICATIVE FRAMEWORK: OVERVIEW OF CURRENT RESEARCH IN THE FIELD OF INTERACTION OF DEVELOPMENT PHASES AND ASSESSING VALUE OF SMALL AND MEDIUM ENTERPRISES" tested various hypotheses, especially the central hypothesis and four supporting ones.

The CONCLUSION summed up the research, outlined significant findings and offered guidance for future research.
