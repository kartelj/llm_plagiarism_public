This doctoral thesis primarily scrutinizes the application of contemporary financial notions to the everyday operations of Serbian companies. It will elucidate concepts such as capital budgeting and its techniques, cost of capital, debt strategy, and capital structures in Serbian companies. The empirical section of the study will assess the practical application of these financial concepts, using a sample of 65 companies from the period of 2013-2017. This applied segment is constituted of two sub-sections: 1) Evaluating the responses from 65 financial executives during the period from 2013-2017; 2) Analyzing solvency and profitability indicators taken from key documents such as Balance Sheets, Income Statements, Notes to the Financial Statements, and Annual Business Reports during the same time frame. The paper will also describe the factors that affect investment and financial decisions, including the size and capital source of the company, duration of financial directors' service, and more. Moreover, a comparative analysis with corresponding international surveys and their results will be undertaken.
