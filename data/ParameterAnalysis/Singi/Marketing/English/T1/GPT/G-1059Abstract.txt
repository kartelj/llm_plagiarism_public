Over the past six decades, tourism has shown substantial positive growth due to the influence of numerous factors. Despite periodic exposure to crises triggered by both economic and non-economic elements, the tourism sector demonstrated a significant rebound capacity, marking growth rates higher than the worldwide economy. Since the start of the 21st century, tourism has been impacted by various crises, a trend likely to persist into the future. This thesis examines the effect of crises on tourism, highlighting their impact and causes. The focus is especially on the repercussions of the 2008 global financial and economic crisis on tourism. A unique survey was conducted to ascertain its impact on tourism in Serbia and the results are discussed in the thesis. Additionally, the thesis offers specific measures to alleviate the negative effects of potential future crises on the sector.
