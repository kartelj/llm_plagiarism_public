The reconstruction of the primary schooling system in Serbia and Yugoslavia between 1944 and 1959, from World War II's close until the implementation of the General Law on Education in 1958, ultimately established a nationwide standard eight-year schooling system that persists in Serbia today. This transformation is the culmination of the "struggle for school" campaign that originated in Serbian society in the late 19th century, and is inherently linked to the broader quest for modernization and democratization in Serbian and Yugoslavian society during the 20th century. 

The revisions to Serbia and Yugoslavia's primary schooling systems that resulted in the 1958 establishment of the standard eight-year school were part of the fight for a "new school". Notably, shortly after World War II, there was vigorous effort expended towards determining new educational and rearing policies and launching reforms of existing educational systems. This was mainly due to the efforts of the United Nations, specifically UNESCO. 

This continued push for a "new" school, which had been previously disrupted by the world wars, was particularly propelled by the newfound recognition of childhood and the severe toll it bore during World War II. The 1944 to 1959 period of reforms in the primary education system embodied part of the societal cultural transformation effort, initiated by the Yugoslavian communist government upon its establishment. This journey towards a more equitable and ideal socialist society required political stability in the country, which was deemed unachievable without economic recovery and, as frequently mentioned, the "overall progress of society" â€“ including "cultural life". 

"Cultural life", which inherently encompasses "educational life", was thus regarded as a crucial component of the "socialist transformation of the society" from the get-go. Decisions made at the Fifth Congress of the CPY (1948) had significant impact on both the country's cultural and education policy, with the Resolution adopted at the Third Plenary Session of the CPY's Central Committee in December 1949 providing key direction. All state institutions, especially schools, needed to adopt the new education policy and contribute to the quest for a socialist citizen. Schooling had to depend on a robust system of mass organizations, in particular the Pioneer Organization, "trustworthy" party cadres, many experts from various fields congregated under the Council of Societies for Child and Youth Care of Yugoslavia, and millions of previously "disregarded" parents. Like other members of the socialist community, these parents also had their roles in constructing socialism. In this manner, the "new" education policy paved the way for conceiving of school as the launchpad for societal modernization, cultural revolution, and the construction of socialism.
