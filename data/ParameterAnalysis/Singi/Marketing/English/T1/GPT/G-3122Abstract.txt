Serbian spas are a vital tourism product that appeals to both local and international tourists. This sector of tourism is continually evolving to meet changing tourist demands. A growing sophistication in tourists' preferences and a desire for recreation and relaxation in Serbian spas necessitates the need for tourism providers to adjust their offerings to surpass their competitors. They can achieve this by employing a mix of communication methods to reach potential customers. Despite increasing interest, spa services are usually at a physical distance from tourists, hence the need to provide them with information about these services and offerings. The use of modern information technology to promote spa tourism has proved beneficial for both customers and providers. From a marketing perspective, it offers an efficient, cost-effective way to connect with potential customers. For tourists, it simplifies information access about spa offerings and sharing of photographs and other content related to their spa experiences. This study examines the use of traditional and digital communication means in promoting Serbian spas and their role in influencing visitors' decisions. Web analysis of select spa destinations reveals that all spas have a website, but do not maximise their full promotional benefits. Additionally, an examination of social media usage such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest, and Google + revealed sporadic usage and inconsistency in content update. The study also investigates the impact of both traditional and digital communication on tourists' decision-making process, aiming to confirm or refute the necessity for an optimal blend of these communication means. The findings indicate that tourists typically choose Serbian spas based on television advertisements and recommendations from friends. From a digital media perspective, Facebook and websites are primary information sources. For Serbian spa tourism to flourish, it is crucial that marketing strategists use the appropriate combination of traditional and digital communication channels.
