The conservation of natural ecosystems, which offer a range of ecosystem services to humanity, has evolved into a prevalent subject both scientifically and practically. This paper sought to ascertain the diversity, capabilities, significance, and state of the components making up natural ecosystems within Libya's larger protected areas. It suggests conservation models and the sustainable use of these ecosystems, primarily focusing on long-term preservation and sustainable community development under Libya's current challenging socio-economic and political circumstances. 

Libya's protected areas are notable for natural values, and if used sustainably, they offer significant ecosystem services that benefit locals. The analysis carried out addresses aspects such as abiogenic factors (climate, relief, soil, water, geological background), biogenic factors (flora, fauna, vegetation), population characteristics, traditional and modern activities, potential directions for sustainable development, and the significance of these protected areas for Libya's strategic development. It also underscores strategic documents, with the spotlight on those relating to sustainable development, biodiversity conservation, desertification combat, fisheries development, and others important for integrated environmental, nature and local population interest policies.

The crux is that Libya should adopt a sustainable development strategy witnessed in many countries, facilitated through balanced economic growth, a competitive market economy, workforce development and education, increased employment and social inclusion, infrastructure development, balanced regional development, and prudent use and improvement of the environment and natural resources.

Based on the research in two of Libya's protected areas, these locations serve as a fountain of natural values and resources, providing ecosystem services to locals. The majority of the population confirms benefits from these resources, primarily in food sources for families and selling food to the occasional tourists. 

The long-term protection, enhancement and usage of these areas are dependant on maintaining a healthy relationship with their values and resources, ensuring sustainable use without excessive exploitation. However, the role of local community development in protected areas contributing to Libya's strategic development requires further verification due to these communities' small sizes. 

With Libya's tourism development, conditions are expected to improve. However, this necessitates initial efforts towards promoting environmental awareness among those residing afar from protected areas, through education from a young age. Implementation of international obligations, adoption of national strategies, and achievement of a high level of ecological responsibility based on legislative, institutional, personnel, technical and other prerequisites, should carry out according to international and national practices.
