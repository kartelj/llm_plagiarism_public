This dissertation investigates the factors influencing profitability in agricultural enterprises within the Republic of Serbia. It provides a theoretical analysis of the role and unique characteristics of agricultural enterprises, and their significance to economic growth. It also examines the divergence between traditional and contemporary methods used to gauge company performance. The study utilizes empirical and theoretical research methods, citing works from both domestic and international researchers. The empirical side of the study was conducted using financial reports from various agricultural businesses and reports on macroeconomic variables. 

The research examined data from 151 agricultural businesses focused on primary agricultural production between 2014 and 2018. Through this statistical analysis, it was discovered that the examined enterprises generally were profitable throughout the observed time period. However, the results displayed significant variation in the profitability of the enterprises, indicating disparities in success due to individual factors and over time.

One of the main goals of the dissertation is to uncover the reasons behind these differences in profitability. To do so, the study utilized common determinants of profitability, including company size, liquidity, indebtedness, sales growth and materiality of assets, which are internal factors that the company can control. External determinants, such as gross domestic product and inflation, which are outside the company's control, were also considered. 

The econometric panel model was used to examine and answer queries posed by the objective. This approach allows the data to be viewed from a temporal and spatial perspective, enhancing the integrity of the results and conclusions drawn. It was confirmed that all variables used in the study were stationary, and there were no high correlations between them or problems with multicollinearity. The study also ensured there were no issues with heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation in the regression model. 

Findings from the study revealed that company size, an internal determinant, has a positive significant influence on the rate of return on assets, or profitability. In contrast, liquidity, indebtedness, gross domestic product, and inflation had negative significant effects on profitability. Sales growth and materiality of assets were found to have no significant impact on the rate of return on assets. 

The conclusions drawn from this research will aid the management of the examined enterprises and other stakeholders in making informed future business decisions.
