This thesis aims to examine the feasibility of employing the ARIMA model for crude oil price prediction, and managing market risk in oil firms with the VaR approach. This also incorporates their role within a comprehensive management system for companies engaged in crude oil production, processing, and distribution. The ultimate objective for any business, including oil companies, is to optimize profits by either achieving an established target or continuously making profits, regardless of time and business climate. Maintaining market risk in acceptable boundaries is of paramount importance, requiring management to timely implement corrective measures to mitigate risks while optimizing funding sources, involving considerations around volume, timeframes, and prices. The findings affirm the assertion that oil companies should utilize appropriate models for predicting oil price fluctuations and managing related business risks to keep market risk within acceptable levels. This forms a solid foundation for making future decisions in an unpredictable business environment. Future research shall explore the incorporation of existing and new models and methods, and their amalgamation to predict crude oil prices and manage market risk in companies engaged in crude oil production, processing, and distribution. Given the necessity to ensure consistent supply and the maintenance of mandatory crude oil reserves, forthcoming studies will also focus on country risk and energy security implications for the entire economy as well as potential consumers of this finite resource.
