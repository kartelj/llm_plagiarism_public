The study undertaken for this thesis found that even our most sophisticated Electric Power System (EPS) protection systems are not able to adequately safeguard against severe solar storms. Factors such as the reduction in Earth's magnetosphere strength, the 2003 South African Solar storm which occurred at a similar latitude to Serbia, the US's destabilization of Venezuela’s EPS in 2019, and Serbia's challenging security scenario, all underscore the need for an urgent strategic overhaul of the Serbian Electric Power Company to enhance its resilience. The extensive floods in May 2014 that incapacitated the Thermal Power Plants (TPP) "Kolubara" and "Nikola Tesla A" further highlighted the vulnerability of the Serbian EPS to natural disasters. 

A detailed analysis of an EPS collapse revealed that a smaller number of main electricity producers exposes a vulnerability arising from the transmission process to consumers, where saturation of high voltage transformers could disrupt the entire EPS for 12-16 months (Lloyd's report). In South Africa, portions of the EPS took four years to resume operations post such a disturbance. Threats to the regular economic operations, causing tumult and chaos, are being increasingly exploited for hybrid warfare. 

A review of Serbian papers indicated that the national EPS is keeping up with industry trends, transitioning from fewer TPPs to a higher number of renewable energy sources producers by 2030. Because of Serbia's precarious security position in the Balkans, it is crucial that it does not manifest such transparent vulnerabilities. 

The thesis introduces a new “stand by” approach proposing energy-independent communes operating within the existing EPS, empowered by the strong development of the often overlooked industrial energy sector. Large manufacturing companies have the capacity to swiftly augment their backup electricity supply systems, reconfiguring their thermal units into smaller power plants and transforming local distribution networks into independent virtual networks. 

The research identified an increased awareness among Serbian economy managers about solar storms, especially after the media coverage of the 2017 and 2018 events, highlighting the need for a new model for creating independent energy companies. This whole process is underpinned by the senior management of leading companies, their exceptional skills and power, supported by memetics and crony capitalism. The functionality of this approach was supported both by a hypothesis and a fourth survey of Serbian senior management. 

The thesis provided practical measures to safeguard against solar proton events and underscored the need for more research on the health impact of solar storms in Serbia.
