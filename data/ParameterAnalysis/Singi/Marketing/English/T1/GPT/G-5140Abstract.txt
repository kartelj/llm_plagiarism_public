The competition within the tourism industry is becoming progressively fiercer. Tourist spots offering superior services and experiences are increasingly chosen by tourists, becoming the preferred competitive destinations. Those actions taken to cater to the needs of tourists in spa destinations form part of the overall value chain of the spa industry. The providers of these services are links in this value chain, collaboratively delivering a comprehensive spa experience through a series of interconnected activities. In pursuit of improving service quality, businesses involved in the tourist industry are always seeking advanced activities. The confluence of all these business entities at a spa destination ensures tourists can enjoy a complete spa package, comprising numerous individual services or products. This paper presents an analysis and comparison of spa destinations in renowned European countries and those in Serbia, highlighting the status and significance of spas in Serbia. The comparative study outlined the primary strengths and weaknesses of Serbia's spa value chain. The natural potential exclusive to Serbian spas provides them with a competitive advantage, which, if systematically capitalized, could enhance the country's appeal to tourists.
