The motivation behind this PhD thesis lies in the observed lack of adequate application and understanding of psychology in consumer-focused marketing management. The study aims to dissect the complexity and financial implications involved in new product development, necessitating a profound understanding and analysis within the broader context of marketing management. This study explores the application of the psychology used during the creation of new products, taking two instant coffee brands in the Serbian market, Grand Instant and Doncafe Instant, between 2007 to 2015 as case studies.

Data was gathered from both primary and secondary sources. Primary data was collated through quantitative methodology from a sample size of 800 respondents aged between 18 to 30 to determine their attitudes and satisfaction levels. Additionally, managers from both companies participated in qualitative interviews to gain further insight into the company's processes and attitudes. Secondary data on the brand's performance was accumulated from longitudinal studies executed by three recognized regional marketing research agencies.

The dissertation seeks to establish whether psychology was appropriately applied during the new product development process. The principal hypothesis - that a lack of attention to consumers and psychological processes in product development impacts product success and consumer satisfaction - was confirmed. The respondents, treated as a consumer group anticipated to respond to a product, were found to be generally underserved. It was established that the new product development process, while intricate and demanding of a comprehensive understanding of marketing management, was frequently oversimplified. 

The assumption that marketing managers are aware of the importance of psychology in new product development, yet fail to utilize it thoroughly, was verified. Other factors were also found to contribute to this issue, besides time-limited competitiveness. The second assumption, which hypothesized that consumers felt ignored in the development process and subsequently not satisfied with the product, was also confirmed.

The study emphasizes the profound significance of psychology in marketing and the need to base new product development around consumer needs and expectations. In practice, businesses in Serbia fail to adequately utilize psychology in the new product development process and face other associated shortcomings. To overcome these shortcomings, the study suggests modifying the current new product development model mandating the need for consumer research, strategic planning, and respect for modern marketing practices.
