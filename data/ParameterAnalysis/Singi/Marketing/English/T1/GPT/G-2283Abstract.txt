The primary goal of this research is to evaluate the competitive scale of Serbia's economy, the efficiency of Serbia's competitive strategies, and the impact of clusters, a vehicle for enhancing competitiveness, on Serbia's regional competitiveness. To evaluate these hypotheses, the research used methodologies developed by entities such as the World Economic Forum, The Center for Strategy and Competitiveness at the University of Stockholm, and the European Cluster Observatory. The purpose of analyzing the extent to which strong clusters contribute to regional competitiveness was to ascertain the correlation between the strength of clusters in various regions (as gauged by the location quotient) and GDP per capita as a productivity indicator, across five countries referred to as the G-5 – Hungary, Bulgaria, Greece, Romania, and Serbia. This study utilized statistical data collated from the Serbian Statistical Office, EUROSTAT, the World Economic Forum, and the European Cluster Observatory. The results of the analysis reveal a decline in the measures of Serbia’s competitiveness, particularly when compared to other countries at a similar developmental stage. Furthermore, the competitive policy measures presently in place are deemed weak and inadequate. Within the G-5 countries, 13 out of 20 cluster categories analyzed showed a positive correlation between the strength of clusters within regions and regional competitiveness.
