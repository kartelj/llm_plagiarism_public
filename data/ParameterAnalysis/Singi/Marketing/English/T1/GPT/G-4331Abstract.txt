This text questions whether focusing solely on managing employee motivation through external rewards and monetary incentives is enough to enhance performance and satisfaction, given the practical and theoretical challenges of motivation. The basis of this argument is the self-determination theory, which suggests a variety of motivation types that differ in the degree of self-determination. These motivation types are organized along a continuum, ranging from intrinsic motivation (the most autonomous and self-determined) to amotivation (the total absence of motivation). In between these extremes are forms of extrinsic motivation, which differ in their levels of autonomy and self-determination. The focus of this thesis is applying the core principles of the self-determination theory to a group of employees in the hospitality industry in Serbia, aiming to encourage effective motivation techniques. The author investigates how elements within the social environment, including the nature of work and the employment climate, influence the structure of motivation and the subsequent impact on job satisfaction and well-being. The study, conducted on employees from 4- and 5-star hotels in Belgrade, utilizes descriptive analysis, Cronbach Alpha Coefficient, Pearson correlation coefficient, T-test, and variances analysis using version 23 of the SPSS statistical software for data processing. The findings validate the relevance of the propositions of self-determination theory in the workplace.
