Special interest tourism, specifically wine tourism, is experiencing substantial global growth. Serbia, in particular, should greatly tap into this tourism sector, especially considering the country doesn't have many attractions for mass tourism, wine regions included. This piece investigates wine tourism's global significance, its impact on Serbiaâ€™s tourism industry, particularly in the Vrsac region. The aim of this study is to identify the potential and future prospects of wine tourism in Serbia, through extensive research, analysis and comparison. 

The research also delves into a comparative analysis of how both wine tourists and winery managers perceive the various aspects of wine tourism, supply, and marketing activities. The methodological approach identifies the specific features of wine tourism, exploring the Serbian wine tourism supply, and the role of marketing in its development. It then analyzes tourists and winery owner's attitudes to all aspects of supply and marketing activities, subsequently determining the strengths and weaknesses of Serbia's wine tourism. 

Following the analysis and research, the thesis clearly defines wine tourism, its importance in special interest tourism and its impact on tourism spots. It further explores the role of strategic marketing and its specific segments for the growth and quality positioning of Serbian wine tourism on target markets. Up for discussion is also the effective marketing tools for cultivating, advertising, and positioning Serbian wine tourism, ensuring their messages reach target markets efficiently. 

The paper concludes that despite wine tourism in Serbia is only in its nascent stages, it holds immense potential to enhance the country's tourism. Yet, winery entrepreneurs, and managers have not fully harnessed its marketing prospects, which could pose a risk to its survival and growth. However, this also creates an opportunity for strategic positioning in the market through education and apt application of learning.
