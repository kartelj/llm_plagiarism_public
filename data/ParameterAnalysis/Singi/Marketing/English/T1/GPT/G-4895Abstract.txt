Tourism and hospitality have taken on a pivotal role in the financial health of many nations, with infrastructural investments significantly boosting overall progress. This infrastructure coupled with a diverse array of tourism services and products, helps in reducing and even halting the deterioration and decline of countryside areas. Digital transformations rely fundamentally on interactivity and customization, and these are an inevitable occurrence in the context of a globalized and highly mobile job market. In such a backdrop, companies in the tourism and hospitality sector publicize job openings, concentrating their efforts on certain audiences using a wealth of digital data on possible interested parties. Also, non-linear communication modes and distribution of promotional content allow such parties, based on their interests and abilities, access to a plethora of advertising material. Studies performed for a PhD thesis confirmed that media platforms should not be seen purely as passive senders of unidirectional messages, and that their interactivity garners feedback from a fluctuating job market. Data gathered on the usage of social media in recruitment processes confirmed them as essential communication tools. Faced with the constant clash between long-term development driven by converging media communications and short-term financial goals, firms in the tourism and hospitality sector require a carefully thought out and coordinated strategy for attracting applicants that possess the necessary knowledge, experience and expertise.
