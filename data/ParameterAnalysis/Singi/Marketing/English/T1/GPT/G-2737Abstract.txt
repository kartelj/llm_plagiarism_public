Serbia boasts a broad range of tourist attractions with a rich historical background and well-preserved resources. However, the potential of its tourism products remains largely untapped and under-commercialized in the global market. Like many developing nations, Serbia sees the foreign investment as a potential booster to develop this sector, modernize its tourism offerings, increase exports, generate employment, and income, and prevent migration from underdeveloped regions. After all, tourism can often be the primary development opportunity in regions with well-preserved resources. 

This study conducts a thorough analysis of factors attracting foreign investments in Serbia's tourism, including a benchmark analysis of selected competitive countries. The objective is to understand their strategies in hiking their tourism sector's foreign investments and the results they have garnered. This will provide a clearer understanding of Serbia's competitive position relative to these countries. 

In this study, survey results will reveal the attractiveness of Serbia's tourism sector for foreign investments and the critical areas for improvement. The research includes evaluating Serbian tourism's attractiveness to foreign investors and identifying the urgent improvement needs. 

The final part of the study will focus on assessing the competitiveness of local tourist destinations through the Porter's Five Forces model. This analysis will help identify strategies to attract foreign investments by finding the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats in the sector to enhance its competitiveness. 

In conclusion, this study aims to aid in understanding how to attract foreign investments into Serbia's tourism sector and what changes are necessary to enhance the sector's competitiveness.
