The influence of foreign direct investment on the existing account is intricate, varying from positive to negative based on the aggregate level of investment and its industry-wise dispersion. The thesis provides a theoretical and empirical analysis of how foreign direct investment affects the Serbian trade balance and income account, especially its manufacturing sector. Additionally, the thesis examines how foreign direct investment affects technology transfer in Serbia, its capability to secure access to global markets, how it impacts the structure and specialization of exports and imports, and how it influences exchange rate appreciation. The dissertation unveils a study on the causative factors of the existing account deficit in Central and Eastern European countries and further investigates the influence of foreign direct investment on the sustainability of the existing account deficit. This is due to the fact that foreign direct investment serves as a significant means of funding the existing account deficit, which could establish circumstances conducive to financial contagion via diverse channels.
