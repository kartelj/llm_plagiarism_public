The doctoral thesis explores themes of ethics and integrated marketing communications through applications in various marketing areas, from advertising and market research to marketing modelling, promotional mixes and target audience communication, focusing particularly on children and youth. Research indicates potential impacts that brand products could have on purchasing decisions, media consumption choices, attitudes towards advertisements, and consumeristic and materialistic tendencies in children, especially when influenced by advertisements. 

A unique communication strategy is required when a company markets children's products and services, differing from a general communication strategy. An ethical approach to integrated marketing communication, particularly when targeting youth, involves adherence to ethical principles, guidelines, and codes in all marketing activities aimed at children. 

The primary hypothesis suggests that integrated marketing communications shift away from mass communication, favouring a targeted approach to both prospective and existing customers, carried out ethically. Supplementary hypotheses shed light on how advertisements influence young people, the impacts of brand products and services on children's purchases, potential parent-child conflicts arising from excessive ad exposure, the discrepancy between the world portrayed in advertisements and reality, and the potential escalation of materialistic ideologies in children due to ad triggers. 

The findings highlight that younger students (lower primary school classes) have a more positive outlook towards advertisements and prefer branded goods and services, compared to older students (higher primary school classes). Furthermore, it is established that children frequently exposed to advertisements tend to demand purchases, leading to increased parent-child disagreement. Most children do not perceive the world portrayed in advertisements as a true reflection of reality. Evidence supports the notion that materialistic attitudes in children intensify in response to ad stimuli.
