"Economic Progress and Energy Efficiency: Examining the Connection and Performing a Meta-Analysis The correlation between energy efficiency, energy use, and economic progress is evident, both worldwide and specifically in Serbia. This theory has been substantiated by establishing a link between energy efficiency and Serbia's economic growth, affirming a quantifiable, causal relationship between energy use and economic expansion, and showing that this causality is relevant to Serbia as well. Energy efficiency indicators and their trends in Serbia suggest that the rebound effect is applicable in this scenario and using energy consumption as an energy efficiency measure when determining its connection with economic growth is feasible. A thorough, methodical literature review through a meta-analysis revealed factors resulting in varying outcomes in energy-growth nexus studies; key variables include differences in research design, stability of political institutions, economic structure, the degree of economic maturity, and climate. In Serbia, the link between energy use and economic growth is causal and multifaceted, contingent on the type of energy source. The findings align with Serbia being a transitioning economy, substantially impacted by its dominant service sector. The study revealed a significant energy conservation component when determining a causal link between the final total energy use and gross domestic product. It underscores the need to explore new tools and policies to enhance energy efficiency. Energy use should be integrated into any growth and development model. Comprehending the effects of energy use and energy efficiency on economic growth and development is crucial in formulating relevant economic, energy, and environmental policies."
