This study has uncovered the crucial and diverse role that tourist guiding plays in modern travel, especially when it comes to showcasing destinations and attractions to visitors. The process of tourist guiding happens in the form of self-chosen guided tours, and their casual setting enables effective communication of information, knowledge and emotions. The enjoyment and quality of a guided tour depends on the interaction between the guide, the tourists and the environment. The tour creates relationships among the three parties and the guide’s expert narration and management of the group dynamics significantly influence the participants’ experience. Therefore, the role of a guide not only impacts the quality of the destination’s overall travel product but also the offerings of individual tour operators and agencies. Their unique position in the travel sector allows them to manage tourism experiences, promote destinations and uphold sustainable tourism practices. The guides' interpretation and presentation impact how participants perceive a location and understand local cultures, engage in activities, and behave during their stay. As such, the tour guide often becomes a representative or "ambassador" for the destination and their conduct can determine whether tourists feel welcome, decide to extend their stay or plan return visits. The guide's impact on tourists' perceptions often results in them becoming an emblem of the destination. Indeed, tourist guiding is a key strategic factor in the successful presentation of destinations in modern tourism, significantly influencing the quality of the tourism experience, the length of stay, and the resulting economic and social benefits.
