In today's economical climate, the crucial role of international financing in addressing societal obligations is irrefutable, as it has become an indispensable element for modern society to function smoothly. This thesis examines the primary focus of international financing by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), one of the premiere investment organizations in Europe, and its impact on the Serbian market and economy. 

The concept of international financing in Central and Eastern European countries, as we understand it today, emerged in 1990, with the establishment of the EBRD, set up to aid transitioning countries. In Serbia, financial assistance from international investing bodies is not novel, having been in practice since the sanctions placed by the international community were removed in 2001. The significance of this funding cannot be overstated, as it has helped alleviate the economic repercussions of the sanctions and the severe dip in GDP during the 1990s.

Given the complex economic dynamics, new technological advancements, and innovative productions, there's a growing need for additional financing which is the primary focus of this thesis. The goal is to gauge the necessity of foreign investment institutions and their contributions to continuous prosperity.

Central and Eastern European countries have had a profitable and wide-ranging association with the EBRD, evident in investments loans, project co-financing, and joint ventures, particularly in sectors like energy, infrastructure, transport, and finance. This partnership aimed to transform the economies of these countries into market-based ones and to integrate them into the single European market in the future.

The research exhibits that national economic recovery is impossible without intentional and well-planned borrowing from international financial institutions, thereby making fiscal sustainability and monetary stability prerequisites for this kind of borrowing. Well-structured, reliable international investments support economic growth and development.

A positive correlation exists between the EBRD's investments and Serbia's GDP growth rate, primarily driven by investments made in collaboration with the EBRD. The professional community in Serbia, despite reaping the benefits, is not fully aware of our cooperation with the EBRD and the need to manage the countryâ€™s borrowing sensibly.

This thesis underscored the pivotal role of the EBRD in boosting the Serbian economy, and pointed out the myriad benefits of cooperating with the EBRD. It also draws attention to the importance of certain action plans and measures to optimize this cooperation.
