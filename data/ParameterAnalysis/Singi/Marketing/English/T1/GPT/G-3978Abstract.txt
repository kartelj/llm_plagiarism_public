The negative impact of financial instability and insolvency on a business can have repercussions on its management, owners, suppliers, employees, customers, and other stakeholders. However, insolvency law, through bankruptcy reorganisation, can help ensure that start-ups, even insolvent ones, continue to operate. Key areas of concern are how financial hardship and bankruptcy reorganisation impact corporate-governance mechanisms and how these modifications alongside applied bankruptcy laws and bankruptcy duration, influence the success of adopted reorganisation schemes. The aim of this study is to examine how financial troubles and bankruptcy reorganisation affect corporate-governance mechanisms in large and mid-size businesses that implemented a reorganisation or per-pack reorganisation plan from January 2009 â€“ June 2015 in Serbia. The study also evaluates the success of these established reorganisation plans, aiming to identify factors that can aid in reviving Serbia's corporate sector. Among 83 businesses studied, 18 experienced ownership restructuring and 32 had changes in top management. It was found that, in these companies, the ownership structure pre-bankruptcy changed post reorganisation, but top-management remained relatively consistent throughout both the bankruptcy period and first year after plan adoption. Logistical and OLS regression analysis showed that company liquidity and owner involvement in managing the company before bankruptcy impacted the change in ownership structure. Similarly, the size of the company and the bankruptcy procedure used affected management turnover. Other variables did not yield significant statistical results. Concerning bankruptcy reorganisation success in Serbia, findings showed that 75% of companies were still adopting new plans and 25% filed for bankruptcy following adoption of the reorganisation or pre-pack reorganisation plan. Establishing a creditor's board or similar entity with fewer members post reorganisation adoption may increase success rates in Serbia. Overall, findings suggest that with modifications in corporate governance and necessary legal and institutional reforms, bankruptcy reorganisation can be an effective tool to revive businesses in economies that are in transition.
