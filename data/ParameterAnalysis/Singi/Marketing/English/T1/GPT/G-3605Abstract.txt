This study provides a comprehensive overview of significant sources drawn from conventional and modern literature related to Communication, Organizational Science, Social Psychology Values, and Change Management. The review critiques individual studies, analyzes content and compares similar studies with specific respondents. The paper then presents in detail the research conducted for this dissertation, utilizing a select sample from several countries to ensure data relevance and purposefulness. The sample comprised 342 employees, 200 of whom completed an online survey from 5 regional and 10 Western Hemisphere countries, while the remainder received the survey through personal contacts. The outcome of the field study is compared with previously published research, analyzing the similarities and differences. The study aims to validate the statistical indicators showing a correlation between an organization's external communication and its employees' socio-personal values. Factor analysis revealed six indicators of external organizational communication. Statistical methods confirmed a correlation between external organizational communication indicators and employee socio-personal values, thus proving the study's main hypothesis. Few studies in contemporary research, particularly domestic literature, adequately explore external communication as a form of organizational behavior, especially in relation to employee values, desires, needs, motivation, and corporate identity. External organizational communication demands scholarly attention due to its impulsive execution within our societal frameworks, often carried out without strategic planning and left to marketing departments and press release issuers. The study also found a positive correlation between successful external communication and employee work motivation. Furthermore, it revealed significant value priority differences between employees open to organizational change and those resistant to it. These findings align with previous studies which attribute this to 'internal motivation.' Employees less apprehensive about change, possessing a more positive outlook, tend to be more self-motivated and actively participate in the change process. They are often the catalysts for organizational change and heavily value family, personal happiness, education, and financial independence. This new scientific information concludes with proposals on integrating these research findings into organizational systems for improved internal and external communication practices.
