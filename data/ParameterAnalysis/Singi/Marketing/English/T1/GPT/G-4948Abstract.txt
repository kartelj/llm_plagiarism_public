The research paper, “Investment Performance Evaluation of the United States Equity Thematic and Sector Mutual Funds’ Portfolios”, has dual objectives. From a scientific perspective, it seeks to dissect, analyze, and explain the investment performance of fictitious portfolios made up of mutual funds drawn from predetermined stock universes. These are constructed on officially endorsed investment strategies. The societal aim is to introduce a reliable method for analyzing investment performance which could potentially form the basis for setting regulatory criteria. This would also offer value to a broad spectrum of both internal and external stakeholders.

Two categories of models for attributing investment performance were utilized, namely factor-based and asset-based models. Models used within the first category include: Capital Asset Valuation Model, Three-Factor Fama-French Model, Carhart Model, and the Five-Factor Fama-French Model. The latter group featured the Brinson-Hood-Beebower and Brinson-Fachler models along with geometric ones.

This research, focusing on thematic mutual funds, comprises 240 separate funds within the US. Mutual funds were scrutinized on an individual and portfolio level based on a market capitalization and investment style matrix (2x2). All the portfolios examined consist of 60 investment funds corresponding to a specific investment theme.

Factor-based models uncovered dominant market factors. Similarly, asset-based models corroborated factor models results for the prevailing investment style. For all observed factors, it was ascertained their influence on both mutual fund portfolios and individual funds. Expected factors in sync with original models included market premium, company size, momentum, and company profitability. Factors conflicting with initial model expectations comprised investment style and company's investment conservatism.

The results also showed a heterogeneity in excess returns emerging on a sector basis, with the sectors' realized excess returns showing momentum. This suggests that some elements of the investing philosophy are mirrored in strategies that aren't merely down to passive sector tracking. Furthermore, dominant market investment style prediction considerably improved return on portfolio rebalancing annually.

This was further supported based on sector allocation's annual effects and exposure to thematic mutual funds. Analysis of the realized exposure along with the portfolio's structure revealed potential incongruities with declared investment strategies. Analysis of the research findings established a high level of consistency at portfolio and individual level based on factors from the models used.

The use of asset-based models facilitated more beneficial results, aligning better with decisions in investments, by using portfolio and benchmark data. Combined factor model usage with asset-based models validated some market tendencies and provided insights that factor models alone could not. Lastly, the limitations of applying arithmetic models over multiple periods in attributing investment performance were tackled by geometric models. This enabled a successful link of multi-period returns with geometric attribution models – exempt of residuals - thus ensuring consistency of attribution effects across varied periods.
