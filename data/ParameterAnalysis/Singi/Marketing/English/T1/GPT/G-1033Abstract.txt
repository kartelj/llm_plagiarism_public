Supporting tourism as a crucial export industry is a common practice among contemporary nations, since it presents opportunities for increased income and employment. Given the fierce global competition and a plethora of global destinations, these countries need to invest significant financial resources to foster a conducive environment for development and establish a competitive edge. Bearing in mind Serbia's disadvantageous competitive stance globally, alongside insufficient investment, the effects of the global financial crisis on foreign direct investment and the sparse investment in projects, the Serbian government perceives opportunities for development through the enactment of distinct public-private partnership forms and establishing an environment conducive to their implementation, all modelled after successful international practices. Specifically, the chosen forms and methods of investment hinge on investors' investment strategy and the possibilities offered by local regulations. Complex and mutually beneficial relationships ensue between private partners and national companies, particularly in public-private partnership projects, incorporating not just economic and legal factors, but also key social and political considerations, especially in terms of investment in national infrastructure. Consequently, within its rather limited financial resources, Serbia identifies public-private partnership projects as another avenue for revitalising existing businesses, enhancing their performance, leveraging new capacity and creating new job opportunities. This paper aims to outline the opportunities that public-private partnerships can offer, through sustainable organisational models and procedures, for the purpose of enhancing the competitiveness of Serbian tourism and relieving the pressure on public finances.
