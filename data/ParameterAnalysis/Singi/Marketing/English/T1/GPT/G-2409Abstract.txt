The decision-making process invariably includes a risk factor among other considerations. Insurance companies structure their business models around this concept of risk. In order to balance income and expenses, attain profit goals, and remain solvent, they have developed numerous actuarial strategies and models. 

Insurance company transactions are a fundamental part of every national economy. The primary objective is to mitigate risks and guarantee the safety and stability of financial exchanges. Consequently, governments establish regulations and procedures to outline the primary constituents of legal frameworks for their business operations.

To maintain solvency, insurance enterprises establish several reserves. Technical reserves are utilized to meet future liabilities from insurance contracts. These reserves form the basis of balancing anticipated risks such as damages, insured amounts and payouts. Insurance companies also accumulate additional capital (guarantee reserves) to cover unforeseen risks such as disastrous events and unexpected business losses.

As institutional investors, insurance companies invest their reserve funds in the financial market. Effective management of principal market risks during the investment process necessitates the alignment of assets and liabilities to maintain long-term solvency.

Insurance business operations can be impacted by numerous other risks including strategic, operational, credit, and legal among others. Identifying, categorizing, and monitoring these risks require extensive knowledge of methodologies and risk management specifics in insurance companies. Studies have indicated that the practical application of risk management is essential for improving business performance.
