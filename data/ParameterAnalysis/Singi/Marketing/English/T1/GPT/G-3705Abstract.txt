The global economic crisis has shaken all transitioning countries, including ours, leading to decreased investments, a pullout by foreign investors, and mounting debts. Despite rising non-performing loans, Bosnia and Herzegovina's banking sector managed to stave off significant repercussions from the crisis, largely due to its conservative policies, which preserved profit without taking on unnecessary risks. This period also saw an analysis of stock exchange operations in the country, revealing growth, development, and subsequential turnover decline, caused not just by the crisis but also internal factors. The banking sector, largely privatized and dominated by foreign private capital, plays a crucial role in the overall financial system. Deposits fuel the banking operations, and loans constitute the primary product. Since loans have historically been the primary method of fund deployment, posing liquidity risks for banks, credit risk remains a significant concern, a subject partly dissected in this thesis. To maintain a healthy loan portfolio, bank management establishes a crystal-clear loan policy that focuses on maximizing profitability within acceptable risk parameters for the bank. The thesis explores non-performing loan trends in Republika Srpska, using data from the Banking Agency's reports from 2009-2016. The intent was to test econometric theory, provide empirical results, and predict future values. Given Bosnia and Herzegovina's current economic conditions, the biggest focus is on controlling credit risk, liquidity risk, and foreign exchange risk. Since most asset items lack a robust market, sophisticated market evaluations aren't feasible. Foreign investors started expressing interest in the regionâ€™s banking market in the early 2000s. This was influenced by factors like developed financial and credit markets, GDP levels, low inflation rates, economic growth, and productivity. The primary driver for foreign entities was return on investment, which led to their market entry, resulting in enhanced dominance and competitive advantage. The most interest came from German, Austrian, Italian, and French banks. The influx of foreign banks brought expected benefits like new technology and innovation, improved competitiveness and infrastructure, and additional foreign investors. Majority foreign-owned banks outperformed local banks, primarily due to superior services.
