Over the past several decades, cruise tourism, and by extension nautical tourism, has been on a rapid incline. A geographic analysis of cruising destinations confirms that this form of tourism has flourished globally. While there are undeniable benefits including enhanced cultural understanding, bringing people together, and significant economic impact, there are also negative aspects to the growth of cruise tourism. Therefore, strategic management of this sector, particularly in line with the principles of sustainable development, is crucial.

This paper explores the current state of cruise tourism, focusing specifically on its impact in the Kotor municipality. It delves into its potential, pros and cons, strategic developments, and Kotor's competitive stance in the global cruise tourism landscape. Special focus is given to how cruise tourism enhances the town's offerings and its positive economic impact. The author carried out a survey gathering the perceptions of Kotor's economic sector and populace regarding the role and relevance of cruise tourism.

Findings indicate that cruise tourism is seen as a crucial facet of tourism for Kotor capable of propelling Montenegro onto the global tourism stage. Respondents, however, believe that the sector is underdeveloped and calls for efforts to stimulate its growth. The most substantial positive impacts identified were economic benefits in terms of increased local revenue and job creation. From a socio-cultural perspective, benefits included exposure to new cultures and showcasing local traditions. However, the considerable negative impact is the depletion of natural resources.

Survey participants believe that the onus largely falls on the state to balance the positive and negative impacts of cruise tourism, necessitating stronger regulatory measures. Emphasizing education about cruise tourism's importance and fostering dialogue among key stakeholders to address local community needs also emerged as essential aspects.
