Promoting cultural assets in Kosovo and Metohija to bolster their tourism offering plays a crucial role in recognizing the Autonomous Province of Kosovo and Metohija (AP KiM) as a tourist hotspot in the future. Kosovo and Metohija are steeped in a rich cultural heritage and traditional values, which are testament to the diverse ethnic populations residing there. The fusion of cultural influences witnessed within these communities and the destruction of diverse cultural symbols, amid conflicts, despite their historical significance, is noteworthy. At the time of writing this thesis, the importance of preserving cultural diversity in order to build a modern, multicultural, multi-confessional, and multi-lingual society is emphasized. The appreciation of culture and history in the region once part of former Yugoslavia, where Kosovo was located, was governed by legal frameworks. However, the economic benefit of these cultural and historical assets was often overlooked. A shift has been observed in recent decades; the cultural sector now receives more funding than other societal sectors. Moreover, culture has become a source of revenue, with cultural tourism recognized as a profitable endeavour in several countries. To conserve the rich heritage of all ethnic communities within AP KiM and the Republic of Serbia, it is necessary to adopt an innovative approach for the promotion of cultural assets to enhance tourism. This appreciation of historical resources to bolster tourism should adhere to universal standards encapsulating its protection and conservation, stimulating economic growth and fostering reconciliation.
