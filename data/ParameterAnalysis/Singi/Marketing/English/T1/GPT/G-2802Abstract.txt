The doctoral dissertation investigates the significance of sustainability in contemporary destination governance in alpine and dinaric mountain locales. Initially, a comparison is drawn between the application of sustainability by destination management organisations (DMO) in the governance of destinations in the Alps and the Dinaric Alps. Quantitative data collected through a survey is then used to examine the disparities in the implementation of sustainable principles in destination planning, governance styles, development priorities, and the value assigned to various stakeholders within the two regions. Following this, there is an evaluation of the two most advanced mountainous locations in Serbia, Kopaonik and Zlatibor, using sustainable tourism indicators to identify areas of improvement. Lastly, using interviews, a more profound study is conducted into the methods and resources available for the application of sustainable tourism in the German Alps and how their experiences can be applicable to the Dinaric region's mountain tourism development. Matters discussed during the interviews included strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats at the destination; sustainability and associated initiatives and plans; key sustainable tourism stakeholders, preservation of natural resources, sustainable development indicators, and cross-border collaboration. The topic of ecotourism also arose as a pertinent concern during the interviews.
