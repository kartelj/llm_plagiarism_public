Between 2000 and 2014, Serbian merchandise exports saw improvements in technological structure and factor intensity. Despite this, these changes did not sufficiently improve domestic export structure or stimulate strong conditions for long-term growth. When comparing the quality of Serbian merchandise exports with that of EU countries and transitioning Central European economies, Serbia falls significantly behind.

The study focuses on the changes in the technological structure and factor intensity of domestic merchandise exports observed from 2000 to 2014. By studying the shift in the proportion of skill-intensive and high/medium-high technology products, we can start to understand these changes. To stimulate growth and diversification in exports, there needs to be an investment in and transfer of modern technology, particularly through Foreign Direct Investments (FDI), into competitive sectors. There should also be a revaluation of employment regulations and a restructure of the science and education systems. Furthermore, sector-specific strategies and a directed industrial policy is essential for driving technological activities correlated with high spill-over effects. 

A key requirement for Serbiaâ€™s growth is the expansion of foreign trade. Fortunately, there are already institutional frameworks in place to support foreign trade expansion, namely the Stabilization and Association Agreement and Central European Free Trade Agreement (CEFTA) with the EU. Despite some restrictions from the modest growth in the euro area and devaluation of the euro, it is crucial for Serbia that euro area imports demand moderately increases in 2015 and 2016.

This research recognizes the importance of external environmental factors and competitiveness strategies, and their correlation with critical competitiveness indicators for small-medium enterprises in transitional economies. Accordingly, environmental adaptation and the removal of key obstacles via the implementation of proper competitive strategies can equip small-medium enterprises for better strategic positioning and heightened competitiveness in the transitional context.

Lastly, Serbia requires a new concept of systemic competitiveness. Systemic competitiveness involves the strategic creation of conditions for successful industrial growth by state and societal actors. It encapsulates politics and economic determinants and comprises four levels: firm and inter-firm network micro-level, the policy and institution meso-level, the common economic conditions macro-level, and the slow-moving variables like sociocultural structures, the fundamental economy order, and the capacity for social actors to strategize at meta-level.
