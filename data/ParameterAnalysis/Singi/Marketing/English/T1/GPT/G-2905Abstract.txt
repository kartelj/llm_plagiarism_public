In today's modern environments, the integration of public and private sectors is crucial for societal progress. This thesis focuses on the evolution of the legislative guidelines concerning public-private partnerships (PPP) and concessions in Serbia since 1990. The 1970s and 1980s saw a surge in public participation in the private sector, notably in public infrastructure projects in more advanced nations. Yet, in Serbia, concessions were not unfamiliar in their domestic legal and economic realms. Though, PPPs only became part of Serbia's legal system in 2011 with the enactment of the Law on Public-Private Partnership and Concessions. Prior to this, the sector was supervised nationally via the Law on Concessions, while local private sector infrastructure investments adhered to the Public Utility Law. The burgeoning complexity of public-private sector relation calls for steadfast institutional participation to formulate new laws and regulations meeting market needs. This thesis will strongly argue this point. This research aims to illuminate the significance of legislative frameworks in advancing investments through PPPs and concessions. It will use historic insight and examples provided in the dissertation to highlight merits and demerits that have emerged during these frameworks' application, emphasizing the importance of this matter for future legislative frameworks' progress.
