Wine production is a significant facet of Montenegro's agricultural sector, both because it comprises a substantial part of the country's export and due to its relatively low domestic consumption. The wine's unique characteristics, different for each region, underscore its importance within the overall agricultural output and to a specific segment of the country's population. 

This study aims to explore and scientifically validate various methods to enhance the domestic marketability of this product. To achieve this objective, significant improvements need to be made in quality, sales channels, and various other areas. 

Conversely, considering previous performance in wine exports and regional market discrepancies, we have analyzed and proposed several steps to sustain and boost export levels, and widen the market to elevate the sales of high-quality wines. In this regard, we've highlighted opportunities for export to burgeoning markets, such as the USA, Canada, Japan, and China. 

Wine production, being a traditional agricultural practice, is expected to contribute to both agricultural growth and the overall economic development of the country. Hence, it's crucial to invigorate all marketing activities that have hitherto been neglected in wine production and sales.
