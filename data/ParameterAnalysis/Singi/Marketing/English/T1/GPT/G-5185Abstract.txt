The objective of every business system typically revolves around enhancing its operations through process optimization and minimizing costs. Prior enhancements have chiefly utilized cutting-edge technologies, though they mostly focused on isolated aspects of the business like equipment maintenance using work orders and results-analysis from troubleshooting. These improvements failed to consider the full operational process - from the initial defect notification to the final rectification of defects. Consequently, the solutions proposed were often incomplete and in certain instances resulted in inaccurate analysis results. The proposed solution is dependent on outlining an approach that incorporates the entire process, selecting the most suitable standard for the process documentation, examination, and optimization, as well as choosing a data format compatible with the process and recorded objects. Therefore, the solution rests on applying an appropriate standard for the process type, achieved through multi-criteria analysis and reviewing relevant professional literature, utilizing a data warehouse structure, and conducting additional analysis relevant to target parameters and defined limits. The findings from the analysis proved that the selected standard for process documentation supplied the essential elements for optimization. Additionally, using a data warehouse structure offered access to a comprehensive and realistic database. Transforming data from a relational database to a data warehouse structure resulted in a simplified structure that allowed for easy access and dynamic groupings. Moreover, it further justified applying additional modifications with regards to target and threshold values. This concept demonstrated that despite the maintenance system's effectiveness (>95% equipment uptime) when viewed solely from the perspective of work orders, a comprehensive review of the entire process revealed delays during troubleshooting in over 30% of instances.
