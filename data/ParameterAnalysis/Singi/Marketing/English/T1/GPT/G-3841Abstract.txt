Cities' tourism development has been a crucial research topic in recent years. Scholars are fascinated by the potential of cities as multifunctional tourist destinations, leading to innovative ways to leverage existing resources and create new tourist products. This helps the cities to improve their competitiveness in the tourism market. The advantages of city tourism are demonstrated in the ability to cater to tourists of varying demographics and travel motivations, and also the reduced seasonal dependency, resulting in a steady tourist inflow throughout the year. 

The increasing tourist preference for shorter, more frequent city breaks indicates the growing allure of cities as tourist destinations. This contributes to achieving the objectives of numerous tourism providers. The subject of this Ph.D. thesis is the development of city tourism in the Republic of Serbia. 

A comprehensive analysis of the current tourist offerings from the key agents of city tourism development in Serbia has been carried out for an objective and analytical approach to the research subject. The thesis details the results of empirical research conducted on both the tourist supply and demand side, examining stakeholder attitudes, shedding light on the current situation of city tourism, and suggesting improvements.

Feedback from tourists was collected to evaluate the quality of the cities' tourist offerings in Serbia. Furthermore, significant city tourism developers and relevant state institution staff members' views on resource importance for city tourism development and potential solutions for development issues were also studied. The aim of this doctoral thesis is to discover ways to enhance the progress of tourism in Serbian cities, built on an unbiased evaluation of the current city tourism development level.
