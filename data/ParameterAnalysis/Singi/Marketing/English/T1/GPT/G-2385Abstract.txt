The population of mobile phone consumers is steadily growing. A look into the past of mobile devices unveils a series of rapid advancements from device manufacturers leading to the creation of smart phones. These high-powered devices, with their various functions impacting our daily lives, have led us to increasingly rely on them. Smart phones are now used not just for making calls, but also for browsing the internet, utilizing various services such as SMS, MMS and email, and operating in-built hardware like cameras and GPS systems. 

However, as mobile technology has developed, it has also brought about several security issues, particularly regarding the channel of communication - the transmission of data from sender to receiver. Security threats are on the rise due to the lack of sufficient security measures and protective tools. The introduction of mobile phone operating systems has further complicated matters. Even though these systems have their own unique advantages, they also come with a variety of security vulnerabilities. 

As internet usage on mobile devices becomes more prevalent, safety risks pertaining to communication and the establishment of communication channels come into the limelight. As mobile device usage skyrockets, it becomes crucial to address the issue of mobile communication security on an individual level. 

Open source projects provide developers with countless opportunities to design solutions based on their own ideas. Accessing an operating system's source code allowed the creation of an operating system that has become a worldwide market hegemon. The –êndroid operating system quickly became popular among developers because it is built on the Java programming language, and allows modifications even at the operating system level. 

As a result, developers can design unique security mechanisms based on this kernel that other mobile platforms don't usually provide. Based on the Linux operating system, Android belongs to the Open Source Association. Since its inception seven years ago, Android has evolved to version 7.0.

This report analyzes Android's security mechanisms, identifies some shortcomings, particularly regarding the low-level security framework around the system, and suggests ways to improve security using SE Linux. It includes a comparison between the Android Open Source Project (AOSP) and the Security Enhanced (SE) Android system, proposing measures for security enhancement. At the end of this report, a conclusion is provided along with directions for future work.
