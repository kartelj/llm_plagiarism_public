Over the past several decades, nautical and subsequent cruise tourism has seen a significant growth. A look at the geographical distribution of cruise destinations reveals that this form of tourism is thriving globally. While it undoubtedly has positive effects such as fostering unity, promoting mutual understanding, and generating financial benefits, cruise tourism also has its drawbacks. Hence, strategic management of this sector, particularly in line with sustainable development principles, is crucial. 

This study delves into the current state of cruise tourism, focusing on the municipality of Kotor. It explores its potential, pros and cons, strategic growth, and its standing in the global cruise tourism market. The author also examines how cruise tourism enhances the town's offerings and its positive economic impact. 

A survey was conducted to gauge the opinions of Kotor's economic sector and residents on the role and significance of cruise tourism. The findings suggest that cruise tourism is seen as a key element of tourism in Kotor, with potential to put Montenegro on the map as a renowned tourist destination. However, the respondents felt that this sector is not fully developed and needs encouragement. 

The most significant positive outcomes identified were economic benefits, such as increased revenue for local communities and job creation. The primary socio-cultural benefits include exposure to new cultures and showcasing local traditions and customs. The most prominent negative impact is the degradation of natural resources. 

The respondents held the view that the government bears the greatest responsibility in maximizing the positive and minimizing the negative effects of cruise tourism, which would require strengthening legislative regulatory measures. Enhancing education about the importance of cruise tourism and fostering dialogue among key stakeholders to respect local community needs are seen as particularly important.
