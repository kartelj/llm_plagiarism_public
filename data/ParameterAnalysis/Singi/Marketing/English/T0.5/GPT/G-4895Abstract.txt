The tourism and hospitality sectors are becoming increasingly vital to the economies of many countries, with infrastructure investment rapidly aiding overall growth. This infrastructure, along with a diverse array of tourist products and services, helps to halt and reverse the deterioration and decline of rural areas. Interactivity and personalization form the foundation for digital transformations, which are an inevitable part of globalization and the increasing mobility of the labor market. In this context, tourism and hospitality businesses advertise job openings and target their efforts towards specific audiences, using a wealth of digital data on potential candidates. Non-linear communication methods and sharing of promotional content allow individuals to access a wide range of advertising based on their interests and abilities. Research for a doctoral dissertation has shown that media should not be seen merely as passive conveyors of one-way messages, and that their interactivity offers feedback from a dynamic labor market. The study also confirmed the indispensable role of social networks in the recruitment process. Tourism and hospitality companies, caught between the long-term development driven by convergent media communications and short-term economic interests, require a well-thought-out and organized strategy to attract candidates with the necessary knowledge, experience, and skills.
