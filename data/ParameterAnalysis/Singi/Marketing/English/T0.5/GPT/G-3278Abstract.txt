In the cruise tourism industry, there is a growing emphasis on enhancing the quality of the cruise experience, as it greatly influences tourist satisfaction and future behavior. This dissertation aims to delve into the nature of the cruise experience, specifically its precursors and outcomes. The research challenge lies in understanding the cruise experience more deeply and developing a method for measuring its precursors and outcomes. 

The author has opted for a comprehensive approach to evaluate the service theatre model (cruise ship performance) and service quality (quality dimensions). These elements can then be leveraged to create a high-quality cruise experience. The research is grounded in postmodernism, postpositivism, and interpretivism philosophies, employing suitable quantitative and qualitative data gathering techniques. 

The research approach melds induction and deduction, in accordance with the research philosophies. Structural equation modeling was applied to test the conceptual model. The findings affirmed that employees, guests, service setting, and service quality are the precursors of the cruise experience. However, only the emotion experienced had a positive effect on overall satisfaction and influenced future behavior. 

The nature of the cruise experience is a relatively unexplored topic in academia. Therefore, this study can be seen as a significant contribution to the ontology of the cruise experience quality and the evolution of its theory. The research was conducted onboard a cruise ship, in collaboration with the guests, ensuring that all practical aspects were considered. Consequently, the research findings hold managerial significance due to the valuable data, insights, and practical recommendations derived from it.
