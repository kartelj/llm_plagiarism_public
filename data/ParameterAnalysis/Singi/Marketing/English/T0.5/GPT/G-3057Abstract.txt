Promoting the cultural treasures of Kosovo and Metohija to enhance its tourism offerings is crucial for its future recognition as a valuable tourist destination. Kosovo and Metohija is an area rich in culture, tradition, and the cultural heritage of all its diverse ethnic groups. The coexistence of these groups has resulted in a blend of cultural influences, but also the destruction of cultural markers during conflicts, regardless of their historical and cultural significance. As of writing this paper, it is stressed that a modern multicultural, multi-confessional, and multi-lingual society can only be built through the active preservation of cultural diversity. 

The promotion of cultural and historical heritage in the former Yugoslavia, where Kosovo was located, was based on cultural values defined by laws and regulations within a specific time frame. However, the economic promotion of cultural and historical heritage was often overlooked. In recent decades, this has changed, with culture now receiving a portion of the budget alongside other social sectors. Culture should also become a profit source, much like cultural tourism, which has already been identified as such in certain countries. 

To preserve the rich heritage of all ethnic groups in Kosovo and Metohija, as well as in the Republic of Serbia, it is essential to implement and innovate the process of promoting cultural values to boost tourism. The promotion of historical heritage to strengthen tourism should adhere to global criteria that dictate its protection and preservation, thereby contributing to economic development and reconciliation.
