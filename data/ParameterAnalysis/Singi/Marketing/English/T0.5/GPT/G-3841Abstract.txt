The study of tourism development in urban areas has been a significant research focus over recent decades. Scholars have been particularly interested in highlighting the value of cities as multifaceted tourist destinations. Urban tourism is an innovative approach to leveraging existing resources to create a unique tourist product, which can strengthen a city's competitive edge in the tourism market. Cities offer diverse experiences to tourists of various demographics and travel motivations, which is a key advantage over other types of destinations. Furthermore, cities are less affected by seasonal fluctuations, indicating a consistent flow of tourists throughout the year. Current trends suggest that tourists are increasingly opting for shorter, more frequent vacations, often in the form of city breaks. This shift has boosted the appeal of cities as tourist destinations, benefiting a wide range of tourism providers. This doctoral thesis focuses on the development of urban tourism in Serbia. To ensure a balanced and analytical approach, an extensive analysis of Serbia's key urban tourism promoters has been conducted. This research presents empirical findings from both the supply and demand sides of tourism, aiming to understand stakeholder perspectives and draw conclusions about the current state of urban tourism, as well as offer suggestions for improvement. Tourist attitudes were investigated to evaluate the quality of urban tourism offerings in Serbia. The views of key urban tourism promoters and relevant government employees were also analyzed to understand the importance of certain resources for urban tourism development, the main challenges faced, and strategies for enhancing Serbian cities' competitiveness in the tourism market. The ultimate goal of this thesis is to propose ways to enhance urban tourism development in Serbia, based on an objective assessment of its current state.
