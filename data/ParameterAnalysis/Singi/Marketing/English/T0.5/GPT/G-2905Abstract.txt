In today's world, it's crucial to forge connections between the public and private sectors for societal advancement. This thesis will explore the evolution of regulations surrounding public-private partnerships (PPPs) and concessions in Serbia since 1990. The 1970s and 1980s saw a surge in public engagement with the private sector, primarily in developed nations' public infrastructure projects. In Serbia, concessions are not a new concept in the national economic and legal landscape. However, it was only in 2011 that PPPs were incorporated into Serbia's legal framework with the enactment of the Law on Public-Private Partnership and Concessions. Prior to this, the area was governed by the Law on Concessions at the national level and the Public Utility Law at the local level for private sector investments in infrastructure. The increasingly intricate relationship between the public and private sectors necessitates ongoing institutional engagement to establish new regulations that meet market demands. This will form the central argument of this thesis. The study aims to underscore the significance of the regulatory framework for investment development via PPPs and concessions. By providing a historical review and case studies in the dissertation, it aims to highlight the pros and cons of regulatory frameworks seen through their application and emphasize the importance of this issue for the future evolution of regulatory frameworks.
