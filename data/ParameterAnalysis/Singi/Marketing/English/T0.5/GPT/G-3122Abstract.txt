Spas in Serbia are a key attraction for both domestic and international tourists. This sector of tourism is continuously evolving to meet the changing needs and demands of tourists. As tourists increasingly seek sophisticated, relaxing, and recreational experiences, Serbian spas need to adapt their offerings to remain competitive. One way to achieve this is by using a mix of communication methods to reach potential tourists. Despite the growing interest in spa services, many tourists are physically distant from these spas, necessitating the need for detailed information about the spa services and amenities. The use of modern information technology in promoting spa tourism has proven beneficial for both tourists and service providers. For marketers, it provides an efficient, cost-effective means of reaching potential tourists. For tourists, it offers an easy way to learn about spa offerings and share their experiences. This study focuses on the use of traditional and digital communication methods in promoting Serbian spas and their role in influencing tourists' decisions to visit a particular spa. An examination of the web presence of selected spa destinations revealed that while all spas have a website, they are not fully utilizing this promotional tool. An analysis of social media usage also revealed inconsistencies, with marketers failing to regularly update information and content. A study was conducted to determine the impact of traditional and digital communication methods on tourists' decisions to visit a spa destination. The findings suggest that tourists commonly choose Serbian spas based on television advertisements and recommendations from friends. In terms of digital media, Facebook and web presentations are the most used sources of information. For the continued growth of Serbian spa tourism, it is crucial for marketers to utilize an effective mix of traditional and digital communication methods.
