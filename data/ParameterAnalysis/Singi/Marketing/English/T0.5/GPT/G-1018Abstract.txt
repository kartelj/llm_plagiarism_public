The dissertation titled 'Problems of Assessing Value of Small and Medium Enterprises in Different Life Cycle Stages' made a significant contribution to the methodological understanding of two unexplored phenomena in business economics. The research's subject and goal, as well as the problem, hypothesis, methodology, and anticipated research contribution, were highlighted in the introduction. 

The first part of the paper, 'Theoretical Framework: Overview of Current Research in the Field of Interactions of Development Stages and Assessing Value of Small and Medium Enterprises', underscored the importance of small and medium enterprises for national economic development, especially in transitional and post-transitional countries dealing with mergers, reengineering, restructuring, and downsizing. These modern business challenges can be tackled with a suitable small and medium enterprise development policy. It's crucial to examine how different development stages, each with its own set of problems, affect enterprise value. 

To effectively link these two areas for study, methodical concepts and methodologies for assessing the value of small and medium enterprises and diagnosing their development stage were systematically organized within the methodological framework. This paper employed several methods for assessing the book value, yielding value, and liquidation value of small and medium enterprises. 

The second part of the paper, 'Methodological Framework: Overview of Current Methodology in the Field of Interaction of Development and Value Assessing of Small and Medium Enterprises', discusses the selection of a methodological framework. Using the St.Gallen methodology, an overview of four standard ideal development models with proposed criteria was provided. 

In the third part of the paper, 'Applicative Framework: Overview of Current Research in the Field of Interaction of Development Phases and Assessing Value of Small and Medium Enterprises', the central hypothesis and four auxiliary hypotheses were tested. The interaction of development phases and the selection of the proposed methodology were examined for validity. 

The conclusion presented a synthesis of the research, the most important findings, and recommendations and guidelines for future research.
