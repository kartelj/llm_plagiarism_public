The negative impacts of financial distress and insolvency on a company's stakeholders, including management, owners, suppliers, employees, and customers, can be mitigated through effective insolvency laws and bankruptcy reorganisation. This dissertation seeks to explore how these financial challenges and subsequent reorganisation efforts impact corporate governance mechanisms in medium to large companies in Serbia from January 2009 to June 2015. Additionally, it aims to evaluate the success of the reorganisation plans implemented and identify contributing factors to the recovery of the Serbian corporate sector. 

Of the 83 companies studied, 18 underwent changes in ownership structure and 32 saw changes in top-management structure. It was observed that ownership structure was typically altered post-reorganisation, while top-management structure remained relatively stable throughout the bankruptcy period and the first year following reorganisation. 

The analysis suggests that company liquidity and owner involvement in the distressed company prior to bankruptcy significantly influenced changes in ownership structure. Conversely, company size and the specific bankruptcy procedure applied were found to impact top-management turnover. Other variables studied did not show statistically significant influence on pre-bankruptcy ownership and top-management structures. 

Regarding the success of bankruptcy reorganisation in Serbia, the research found that 75% of the companies studied are still in the process of reorganisation, while 25% filed for bankruptcy post-reorganisation. The establishment of a creditor's board or similar body with fewer members post-reorganisation could potentially enhance the success of bankruptcy reorganisation in Serbia. 

In conclusion, this dissertation suggests that bankruptcy reorganisation could serve as an effective tool for corporate sector recovery in transition economies, provided it is accompanied by changes in corporate governance practices and necessary institutional and legal reforms.
