Tourism, as an integral part of the global system, needs to establish its own unique social system, structure, relationships, institutions, and visual expression. This should take into account two key factors: 1) the need to adapt and respond to the evolving needs of potential customers, which are influenced by changes in social development, standards, markets, lifestyles, education, and information; 2) the importance of economic viability and environmental responsibility, considering capital owners, nature and environment preservation, and the cultural achievements of civilization. 

The fundamental component of the tourism sector is hospitality, which the economy equates to a profitable market economy target. Hospitality results in a complex hotel product and related services, specifically designated, designed, and well-equipped to cater to the masses and their varying needs, tastes, abilities, and desires. 

Theoretically, hotel product is defined by location, views, grounds, facilities, equipment, services, price, and brand image. Additionally, the guest experience is a crucial aspect of the hotel product. From this, it can be concluded that the primary elements of the hotel product are its location and services, while the key external factors are the service prices and the hotel's image. 

The growth of international tourism, influenced by the overall development of the world economy, population standards, and new consumer needs, further drives the evolution of hotel products towards quality, price, specialization, and standardization. This adds value for consumers as it creates new experiences including entertainment, recreation, rehabilitation, education, shopping, and personal services. 

The design of hotel products, which is the focus of this doctoral dissertation, is presented as both an artistic technological task and a goal for service creators. It is also a marketing tool for segmentation, positioning, restructuring, or differentiation of the hotel product, and a visual tool to meet tourists' needs in the competitive battle for market share. The primary hypothesis of this dissertation is that successful design of hotel products significantly differentiates them and increases their market acceptance. This is supported by the enclosed scientific research theory and practice of tourism.
