The purpose of this thesis is to explore the potential of the ARIMA model for predicting crude oil prices, and the use of the VaR method for managing market risk in oil companies. This also includes their application in the intricate system of managing companies involved in the production, processing, and distribution of crude oil. The primary objective of any company, including oil companies, is to maximize profitability, achieve its planned rate or sustain profit growth irrespective of time and business conditions. It is vital to keep market risk within acceptable parameters, necessitating timely management interventions to minimize risks and optimize funding sources, taking into account quantities, deadlines, and prices. The findings confirm the necessity for oil companies to use suitable models for forecasting oil price trends and managing risks in crude oil transactions to keep market risk within acceptable bounds. This provides a solid foundation for making future business decisions in volatile times. Future research will focus on the application of other existing and new models and methods, as well as their combinations. This will include testing extreme events for predicting crude oil prices and managing market risks in the business operations of companies in the crude oil production, processing, and distribution sector. To ensure a steady supply and maintain mandatory crude oil reserves at the necessary level, future studies will consider country risk and energy security as prerequisites for the functioning of the economy and all its participants, as well as potential users of this finite resource.
