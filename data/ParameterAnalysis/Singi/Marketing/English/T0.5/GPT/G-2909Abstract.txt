The influence of foreign direct investment (FDI) on the current account is multifaceted, with the potential for both positive and negative effects based on the total investment level and its sectoral distribution. The thesis provided both theoretical and empirical analyses of how FDI impacts Serbia's trade balance and income account, particularly focusing on its effect on the Serbian manufacturing industry. Additionally, the thesis examined how FDI influences technology transfer in Serbia, the country's ability to access international markets, changes in export and import structures and specializations, and the appreciation of the exchange rate. The dissertation also explored the reasons behind the current account deficit in Central and Eastern European countries, and the role of FDI in sustaining this deficit. This is due to the fact that FDI is a crucial source of financing for the current account deficit and can potentially lead to financial contagion through various channels.
