Modern retail is primarily determined by dynamic business conditions. Increased demand, leading to increased revenue, necessitates a company's ability to swiftly and accurately respond to market challenges to maintain business growth. A fast-paced retail model ensures there are no inventory shortages, as delivery delays can result in lost sales, customer dissatisfaction, and a decrease in competitive advantage. This paper aims to analyze the effects of demand forecasting on inventory management and establish a universal methodology for these processes. The study systematically reviews the scientific and theoretical aspects of inventory management. A comprehensive analysis of multi-criteria demand management's importance in inventory management highlights the key factors in researching demand forecasting efficiency. The main research objective was to identify modern business conditions' demand specifics, then show the effective application of forecasting methodology as a crucial inventory management segment. A company whose operations are not based on demand forecasting as an inventory management factor is not sustainable in the long run. The research used data from Winwin Shop Čačak's retail store, forecasting demand for four product categories across over 100 retail stores, accounting for over 40% of total sales. The study results indicated that demand forecasting is crucial for improving retail operations' efficiency in modern business conditions. The multi-criteria method, the Analytical hierarchical process, provided the mathematical foundation for the research, while the Expert Choice software solution supported estimating and forecasting future product demand. The findings reaffirm that demand forecasting is essential for inventory optimization and enhancing company efficiency. However, subjectivity's impact on the demand forecasting process can be minimized but not entirely eliminated.
