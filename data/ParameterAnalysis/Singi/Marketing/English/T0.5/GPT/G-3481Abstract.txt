This doctoral thesis primarily explores the application of contemporary financial theories in the routine operations of Serbian companies. The thesis will introduce concepts like capital budgeting and its methodologies, cost of capital, debt policy, and the capital structures of Serbian companies. The practical application of these financial theories will be scrutinized in the empirical section of the paper, which will analyze a sample of 65 companies from 2013 to 2017. The empirical section is divided into two parts: 1) Assessing the responses of 65 financial executives from 2013 to 2017 and 2) Evaluating the solvency and profitability indicators of the sampled companies, derived from significant documents like Balance Sheets, Income Statements, Notes to the Financial Statements, and Annual Business Reports from 2013 to 2017. Factors that affect investment and financial decisions, such as company size, capital source, age and tenure of financial directors, etc., will also be discussed. Furthermore, the findings will be juxtaposed with corresponding international studies and their outcomes.
