Wine, a specific product of Montenegro's agriculture, has a relatively low domestic consumption but a significant export share. This, along with the unique characteristics of the country's grapes and wine, underscores its importance in the overall agricultural production and to a significant portion of the population. 

This study aims to investigate and scientifically validate methods for enhancing the marketing of this product in the domestic market. To achieve this, significant improvements in quality, sales channels, and other areas are necessary. Additionally, considering previous wine export results, regional destinations, and shortcomings in foreign market promotion, numerous measures are proposed to sustain and boost export levels and expand the market for high-quality wines. In this regard, we focus on exploring export opportunities in promising markets such as the USA, Canada, Japan, and China.

As a traditional agricultural sector, wine production is expected to contribute to the country's agricultural and economic development. Therefore, it's crucial to enhance all marketing activities, which have been somewhat overlooked in past wine production and sales efforts.
