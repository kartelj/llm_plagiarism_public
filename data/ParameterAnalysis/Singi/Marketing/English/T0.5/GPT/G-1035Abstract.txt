This study aims to evaluate the impact of various balance sheet and off-balance sheet factors on the interest rate risk exposure of banks in both developed and emerging financial markets. The quantification of this exposure aids in the identification, monitoring, and management of interest rate risk. We examined 65 bank holding companies in the United States as a representative of a developed financial market, and 10 banks from the Republic of Serbia, listed on the Belgrade Stock Exchange, representing an emerging financial market. We conducted a comparative analysis of the influence of balance sheet characteristics using Stone's regression model and the econometric panel model. The findings from these models suggest that factors like bank size and the proportion of deposits in total assets have a significant but contrasting effect on banks in developed and emerging markets. For instance, an increase in total assets of U.S. banks heightens their exposure to interest rate risk, whereas in Serbia, the effect is reversed. Similarly, a rise in the proportion of deposits in total assets reduces interest rate risk exposure for U.S. banks, but Serbian banks experience a different effect. However, certain statistically significant factors, such as an increase in return on average equity (ROAE) and a decrease in net interest income, influence a reduction in banks' exposure to interest rate risk, irrespective of the market's development level.
