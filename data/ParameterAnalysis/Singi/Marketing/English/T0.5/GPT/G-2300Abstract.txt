The Serbian banking sector faced unique circumstances from 2008 to 2016, which changed the way liquidity was managed. This study examines the challenges that these volatile market conditions posed to the management structures of domestic commercial banks. It also explores the responses to these conditions, particularly in terms of liquidity, and their relationship to the established FTP system. In a banking sector like Serbia's, where hedging instruments are not developed, the correlation between the FTP system and the development of financial instruments was a key question. The concept of Asset and Liability Management (ALM) was also developed. The study also questioned the application of a uniform FTP system model in banks in terms of liquidity, especially between 2008 and 2016, and the implementation and implications of 'best practices' and new principles known as Basel III. 

A comparative analysis was conducted on two commercial banks operating in Serbia during the liquidity crisis at the end of 2008. The findings suggest a high sensitivity to systemic and specific factors, limitations of liquid financing sources, and shallow domestic markets. The crisis significantly increased funding costs and deepened the maturity mismatch balance, especially for Bank B. Bank A showed similar high sensitivity to systemic risks due to the insolvency of the banking sector. Access to short-term funds to overcome the liquidity crisis was not fully effective, considering that Bank B deepened maturity mismatches four years later.

The findings indicate that due to the illiquid interbank market, significant deposit outflow sources, increased interest rates, and low levels of liquidity coefficient regulatory, Bank A and Bank B had to resort to different measures. Bank A issued shares and changed the bank's ownership structure, while Bank B borrowed funds at prices higher than the market and postponed the liquidity problem to the following year.

The study rejected the first hypothesis that commercial banks apply modern concepts of liquidity risk management, as many banks in this segment rely solely on regulatory requirements for liquidity risk. The second hypothesis, that the FTP system is sensitive to liquidity conditions and the illiquidity of the banking sector, was also rejected. However, the third hypothesis was accepted, demonstrating a link and ALM positions in commercial banks, and their responsibilities are directly correlated with the FTP system.
