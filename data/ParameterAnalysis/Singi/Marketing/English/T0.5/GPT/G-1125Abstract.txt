The financial system has been experiencing significant structural shifts for many decades. These shifts are evident in the altered importance of certain types of financial institutions, the merging of diverse financial activities within complex financial institutions, and the expansion of their activities. The prevalent use of mergers and acquisitions among banks and other financial institutions is a part of the restructuring of the financial sector. The significant increase in the number of mergers and acquisitions among banking institutions in developed EU countries is seen as a part of global trends such as bank restructuring and expansion, as well as a result of the establishment of a single financial market triggered by the introduction of the euro as a single currency. The enhancement of competitiveness in both the real and financial sectors is crucial for bolstering bank mergers and acquisitions aimed at enhancing operational efficiency and profitability in a globalized context. While bank mergers and acquisitions in developed EU countries typically involve the transfer of ownership rights between private shareholder groups, in transition countries, they usually involve the acquisition of formerly state-owned banks, primarily by foreign banks from developed EU countries. The economic aspect of the banking sector in transition includes increased bank efficiency and profitability, the adoption of modern financial technology, and contemporary risk management methods. To ensure the successful completion of mergers and acquisitions, it is essential to properly project and evaluate these transactions and implement an appropriate post-acquisition integration strategy.
