The thesis poses the question of whether it is enough for organizations to solely concentrate on managing motivation through financial incentives and external factors to enhance performance and employee satisfaction, given the practical and theoretical issues associated with motivation. The self-determination theory, which serves as the basis of this thesis, suggests that there are various forms of motivation, each with differing degrees of self-determination. These different types of motivation are organized along a continuum, with intrinsic motivation (the most autonomous and self-determined form) at one end, and amotivation (or the absence of motivation) at the other. Between these two extremes, there are several forms of extrinsic motivation, each with different levels of autonomy and self-determination. 

The thesis then applies the primary principles of the self-determination theory to a group of employees in the hospitality sector in the Republic of Serbia, with the goal of advocating motivational strategies and methods. The author investigates how social environmental factors, like work climate and job type, influence the structure of motivation (autonomous/regulated/amotivation) and, subsequently, job satisfaction and personal wellbeing. 

The study was carried out using a sample of employees from 4 and 5-star hotels in Belgrade. The data collected was analyzed using the SPSS statistical program, version 23, employing descriptive analysis (mean, standard deviation), the Cronbach Alpha Coefficient to assess the reliability of the scales used in the sample, and statistical conclusions. The Pearson correlation coefficient, T-test, and variance analysis were used to test relationships and differences based on measured characteristics. The research validates the applicability of the self-determination theory principles in a work setting.
