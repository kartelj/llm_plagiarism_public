The thesis explores a relatively untouched topic about the impact of printing and packaging procedures on the properties of printed flexible packaging materials. It also discusses the determination of these properties by using suitable multicriteria evaluation methods. An experimental analysis was conducted on flexible packaging materials to evaluate and compare the extent of their changes. The study and assessment had certain limitations, mainly concerning the chosen packaging materials and the type of contents packaged. The outcome of this assessment is a clear total of the values for different versions of printed flexible packaging materials. This allows for the calculation of compliance with requirements for each material for different food products.
