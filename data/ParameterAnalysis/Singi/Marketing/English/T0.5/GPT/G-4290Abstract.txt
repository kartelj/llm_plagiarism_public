In today's economic climate, international financing is essential for meeting societal needs, without which modern societies cannot operate. This dissertation researches the emphasis on international financing by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, a leading investment organization in the European economy, and its impact on Serbia's market and economy. This form of international financing, as we understand it today, began in 1990 in Central and Eastern European countries when the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development was established to aid transitioning countries. In Serbia, international investment organization funding has been crucial since sanctions were lifted by the international community in 2001. Without this, the Serbian economy's situation and the rate of activity during the transition process following economic sanctions and a sharp GDP decline in the 1990s would have been more detrimental. The need for additional financing sources due to complex economic relations, new technologies, and production is the primary focus of this dissertation. The research aims to explore the significance and necessity of foreign investment institutions and contribute to their continued growth. All Central and Eastern European countries have had successful and extensive collaboration with the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development through investment loans, joint project financing, joint ventures in various sectors, primarily energy, infrastructure, transport, and finance, with the goal of transforming these economies into market economies and connecting the future single European market. The research's main conclusion is that a national economy cannot recover without planned and well-designed borrowing from international financial institutions, with appropriate monitoring and control. Due to the complexity of business relations and the complexity of business opportunities and trends, fiscal sustainability and monetary stability are critical prerequisites for this type of financing. The inflow of cost-effective, reliable international investments supports economic growth and development. Economic development in the transition process cannot be envisioned without additional international financing. It is also worth noting that all economies that worked with the EBRD experienced overdeveloped economic growth and recorded better business results than during recession years. Despite the benefits of cooperation with the EBRD, the professional public in our country is not sufficiently aware of its significance, emphasizing the need for a rational relationship with the country's credit indebtedness. This dissertation also analyzed the degree of impact of investments implemented in cooperation with the EBRD on the economic recovery and transition of the Serbian economy and the factors influencing this, finding a positive correlation between these investments and the GDP growth rate of Serbia and the positive influence of EBRD's investments on Serbia's GDP growth rate. The analysis confirmed that the EBRD played a significant role in the economy's recovery and transition through financing and advisory services. The dissertation highlights the advantages of cooperation with the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development through a detailed overview of economic trends and numerous examples of specific project realizations, drawing attention to the importance of certain activities and measures to enhance this cooperation.
