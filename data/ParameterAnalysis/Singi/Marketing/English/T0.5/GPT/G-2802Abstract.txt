The doctoral dissertation explores the significance of sustainability in contemporary destination governance, focusing on alpine and dinaric mountain destinations. It initially contrasts the application of sustainability in destination governance by Destination Management Organizations (DMOs) in the Alps and Dinarides. Quantitative data was gathered via a questionnaire to examine the regional differences in the incorporation of sustainability principles in destination planning, management styles, development priorities, and the value attributed to various stakeholders. A comparative analysis is then conducted on Kopaonik and Zlatibor, the two most developed mountain destinations in Serbia, using a comprehensive framework for sustainable tourism indicators. This analysis helps identify gaps and propose improvements for both destinations. Lastly, in-depth research is conducted through interviews to explore the methods and resources available for implementing sustainable tourism in the German Alps, an alpine region whose experiences could be beneficial for developing mountain tourism in the Dinarides. The interviews covered topics such as strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats in the destination, sustainability-related project initiatives and plans, key stakeholders in sustainable tourism, natural resource conservation, sustainable development indicators, and cross-border cooperation. The topic of ecotourism also emerged as a significant issue during the interviews.
