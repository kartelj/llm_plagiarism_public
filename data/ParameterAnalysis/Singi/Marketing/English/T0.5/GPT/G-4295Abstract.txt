Serbia is actively participating in the process of joining the European Union and has aligned its national technical legislation with EU law. It has made substantial progress in waste management, achieving a good level of compliance with main EU directives in this field. However, the practical implementation is still in its early stages, despite some advancements in waste collection and sanitary landfill disposal. 

Waste management is a state responsibility, with the primary objective of reducing environmental pollution and utilizing waste as a resource. EU environmental protection regulations are detailed, specific, and comprehensive, yet flexible enough to allow member states to adapt their implementation methods to their constitutional and institutional frameworks.

Serbia's existing hazardous waste treatment infrastructure is not prepared to meet the requirements of the New and Global approach to the EU. The development and adaptation of new methods and technologies, as well as construction of facilities for these new technologies, is a lengthy and costly process. Therefore, all available national resources must be mobilized to align with and implement environmental protection and waste management legislation. This will promote human health and economic development while meeting the needs of current and future generations. 

The hazardous waste management system in Serbia currently lacks any form of hazardous waste treatment. This paper proposes a solution for the disposal and complete destruction of hazardous waste that has accumulated in many Serbian companies. The proposed treatment plant will handle hazardous waste such as PCB oil, Ni-Cd batteries, and biodegradable waste. The paper outlines the present hazardous waste situation and accompanying legal regulations, and it suggests a methodological procedure using plasma technology for total waste disposal and energy conversion into heat and electricity. The paper also presents a profitable business model for this approach.
