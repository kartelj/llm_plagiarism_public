The significance of conserving natural ecosystems, which offer a range of ecosystem services to humanity, is increasingly being recognized from both scientific and practical perspectives. This paper aims to explore the variety, potential, importance, and state of all elements of natural ecosystems in Libya's larger protected areas. It suggests models for the conservation and sustainable utilization of these ecosystems, particularly with regard to their long-term preservation and the sustainable development of local communities amidst Libya's challenging economic and political climate. 

Libya's protected areas are not only rich in natural value but also represent a resource that, when used sustainably, can deliver significant ecosystem services benefiting the local population. This paper analyzes various values and resources of these protected areas, including abiogenic factors (such as relief, geological background, soil, water, climate), biogenic factors (flora, fauna, vegetation), and human population (composition, structure, socioeconomic characteristics, traditional lifestyles, activities, potential directions for sustainable development in line with natural values and traditional lifestyles). 

The paper also discusses the significance of these protected areas for Libya's strategic development, including the creation of strategic documents such as a strategy for sustainable development, biodiversity conservation, desertification combat, fisheries development, and other crucial environmental, nature, and local population interest policies. 

To join nations that have adopted a national sustainable development strategy, Libya should focus on developing a competitive market economy, balanced economic growth, human development and education, increased employment and social inclusion, infrastructure development, balanced regional development, environmental protection, and rational use of natural resources. 

Based on a study of two respondent groups in two protected areas in Libya, it can be concluded that these areas are a source of natural values and resources that provide ecosystem services to the local population. Most respondents confirmed that they benefit from the use of resources from these protected areas, primarily as food sources for families or for selling to occasional visiting tourists. 

With proper management of these values and resources, their long-term protection, enhancement, and use can be ensured. The resources from these protected areas are used sustainably, and there is no over-exploitation. However, the contribution of local communities' development in these protected areas to the state's strategic development is not entirely proven due to the small size of these communities. 

Improvement in this area could be achieved with the development of tourism in Libya, but this requires prior development of environmental protection awareness among people living outside these protected areas, through education at all levels. Fulfilling international obligations and adopting national strategies that achieve a higher level of ecological responsibility are also essential, in line with international and national practices.
