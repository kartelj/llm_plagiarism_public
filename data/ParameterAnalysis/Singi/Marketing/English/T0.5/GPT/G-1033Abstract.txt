Modern nations recognize the significance of tourism as a key export industry, viewing it as a source of revenue and a means to boost employment rates. Amidst global competition, these countries must invest significant financial resources to create the right conditions for tourism growth and to establish their competitive edge. Serbia, however, faces a challenging competitive position on the global stage due to insufficient investment, the impact of the global economic crisis on foreign direct investment, and a lack of investment in projects. The Serbian government sees potential growth through the application of specific public-private partnership models, following successful international examples, and creating a conducive environment for their execution. The investment methods and forms are determined by the investors' strategy and the options permitted by national regulations. The complex relationship between the private partner and national enterprise in public-private partnerships is further complicated in projects, gaining significant social and political dimensions, particularly in national infrastructure investments. Therefore, Serbia, with its limited financial resources, views public-private partnerships as another opportunity to revitalize existing businesses, enhance their operations, activate new capacities, and create new jobs. This thesis aims to highlight the opportunities that public-private partnerships offer through long-term organizational models and procedures to enhance Serbia's competitive position in tourism and alleviate public finance pressures.
