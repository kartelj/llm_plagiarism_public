This paper presents a comprehensive review of pertinent sources from both traditional and modern literature in the domains of Communication, Organizational Science, Social Psychology Values, and Change Management. The literature review is accompanied by a critical analysis of the limitations of individual studies, content analysis, and a comparison of similar surveys conducted on specific participants. 

The research conducted for this dissertation is then presented, which involved a thorough analysis of data collected from a suitable sample across multiple countries, with the aim of enhancing the relevance and purposefulness of the results. The study involved 342 participants, 200 of whom completed an online survey from five regional countries and ten Western Hemisphere countries. The remaining participants received the questionnaire through personal contact. 

The findings from this field study were compared with previously published research from both domestic and international literature, and an analysis of similarities and differences was conducted. The paper seeks to establish whether there are statistically derived indicators showing a correlation between an organization's external communication (i.e., its communication with the public) and the socio-personal values of its employees.

Factor analysis of the sample revealed six indicators of an organization's external communication. As correlations and other statistical methods demonstrated a relationship between these indicators and the socio-personal values of the organization's employees, the primary hypothesis of this research has been validated. 

Modern research, particularly domestic literature, lacks a systematic approach to the study of external communication as a form of organizational behavior. Specifically, there is a dearth of research examining the relationship between an organization's external communication and the values, desires, needs, motivation, and corporate identity of its employees. 

The research also found a positive correlation between the success of an organization's external communication and employee motivation. However, employee attitudes towards organizational change varied significantly, with those more accepting of change demonstrating different value priorities to those resistant to change. 

This dissertation contributes new scientific knowledge to the field and concludes with recommendations for how to better incorporate the research findings into organizational systems and their internal and external communication channels.
