The motivation behind this PhD thesis lies in the observed underutilization or misunderstanding of psychology and consumer comprehension in marketing management. The study concentrates on new product development, an intricate and financially risky process that necessitates comprehensive analysis and understanding of marketing management. The thesis scrutinizes the use of psychology in new product development, using the case study of instant coffee products, Grand Instant and Doncafe Instant, in the Serbian market from 2007 to 2015. 

Data sources for the study include primary and secondary data. Primary data was collected through quantitative methodology from a representative sample of 800 respondents aged 18 to 30, to analyze consumer attitudes and satisfaction. Qualitative methodology was also used, involving interviews with managers from Grand and Doncafe, to understand company-level processes and attitudes. Descriptive statistical methods were used to analyze the data. Secondary data on brand performance was obtained from longitudinal studies conducted by three well-known regional market research agencies.

The thesis investigates if psychology was adequately utilized, understood, and appreciated in new product development. The central hypothesis, that neglecting consumer and psychological processes in new product development affects product success and consumer satisfaction, was confirmed. The consumer was viewed as a group expected to react to a product as per trends in neighboring countries. Despite new product development being a complex process demanding comprehensive marketing management knowledge, it tends to be oversimplified. The initial assumption, that marketing managers rely on psychology in new product development but only superficially, was also confirmed. This is not just due to time-limited competitiveness but other factors as well. The second assumption, that consumers feel under-involved in the process and express this through dissatisfaction and non-usage of the product, was also confirmed. In the case study, consumers were unhappy with how Grand Kafa and Doncafe engaged them in new product development.

Starting the new product development process based on consumer needs and meeting their expectations, as per marketing principles, underscores the undeniable importance and contribution of psychology in marketing. The thesis concludes that Serbian enterprises, in addition to underutilizing psychology in new product development, also face challenges related to the process itself, such as lack of acceptance of the marketing concept, production of formal documents, and strategic planning and consumer research. A revised new product development model is proposed to address these four shortcomings, mandating the production of formal documents at various stages of product development, which necessitates consumer research and strategic planning, thereby upholding the modern marketing concept.
