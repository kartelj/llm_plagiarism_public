The research conducted for this dissertation on the implications of solar attacks reveals that even the most sophisticated electric power system (EPS) protection systems are insufficient against high-intensity solar storms. Factors such as the Earth's weakening magnetosphere, the 2003 solar storm in South Africa (which shares a similar latitude with Serbia), the destabilizing of Venezuela's EPS by the USA in 2019, and Serbia's complex security situation, have necessitated the development of a strategic restructuring plan for the Serbian Electric Power Company. This is aimed at enhancing its resilience within a short timeframe. The severe floods in May 2014, which incapacitated the Kolubara and Nikola Tesla A Thermal Power Plants for an extended period, further underscored the vulnerability of Serbia's EPS to natural disasters. A comprehensive investigation of EPS failures reveals that the model of having fewer, large-scale electrical energy (EE) producers is flawed, as the EE transmission system to consumers is a weak link. This is evidenced by the fact that saturation of high voltage transformers can disrupt the entire EPS for 12 to 16 months, as per Lloyd's report. In South Africa, it took four years for some EPS segments to become operational again. The threat to the economy and the ensuing social unrest and chaos are all part of a growing trend of hybrid warfare aimed at destabilizing state security systems. An analysis of Serbian research papers indicates that the Serbian EPS is contemporary and is transitioning from fewer thermal power plants to more renewable energy sources (RES) by 2030. Given Serbia's intricate security status in the Balkans, it is crucial that it does not exhibit any apparent weaknesses. This dissertation proposes a new "stand by" concept for creating energy-independent communes within the existing EPS, relying on the robust development of underutilized industrial energy. Only large manufacturing firms have the capacity to swiftly enhance their backup EE power supply systems, by converting their thermal units into small thermal power plants and transforming a local distribution network into an autonomous virtual network with its own EE producers. These will serve as the driving force of energy-independent local administrative units. A study on the changing awareness levels of Serbian economic managers regarding the 2017 and 2018 solar storms (before and after media coverage) indicated the need for a new model to create energy-independent companies for quick implementation of the energy-independent communes concept. The model's operational mechanism is based on the senior managers of leading companies, their excellence and power position, combined with memetics and crony capitalism. The model's functionality was validated by a hypothesis and a fourth survey conducted among senior management in Serbia. This dissertation also offers practical solutions for protection from solar proton events and highlights the lack of research on health issues caused by solar storms in Serbia.
