Serbia boasts a rich array of tourist attractions and a long history, with many preserved resources. However, the country's tourism offerings have not been sufficiently developed or marketed internationally. To enhance their positioning, it's crucial to boost competitiveness, a task that requires substantial financial investment. Like many developing nations, Serbia views foreign investment as an opportunity to develop its tourism sector, modernize its offerings, increase exports, create jobs, and boost income. It also sees it as a way to prevent migration from underdeveloped regions where tourism, thanks to the well-preserved resources, can often be the only development opportunity.

This dissertation conducts a thorough analysis of the factors crucial for attracting foreign investment in Serbia's tourism industry. It includes a benchmark analysis of selected competitive countries to understand how they have increased foreign investment in tourism and the results they've achieved. The goal is to comprehend Serbia's competitive position relative to these countries.

Research conducted via questionnaires reveals the extent to which Serbia's tourism industry's attractiveness factors for foreign investment are met and identifies the critical areas that need improvement. The findings shed light on whether Serbia's tourism sector's attractiveness meets foreign investors' expectations and what other critical areas need to be prioritized.

The final research focuses on the competitive environment of the local tourist destination, using Porter's Five Forces model adapted for this purpose. It aims to identify opportunities to strengthen the destination's position relative to the five forces, determine its strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats, and define a strategy for attracting foreign investment to enhance its competitiveness.

This dissertation aims to help answer the question of how to attract foreign investment in Serbia's tourism industry and what steps should be taken to enhance the existing environment, thereby increasing the sector's competitiveness.
