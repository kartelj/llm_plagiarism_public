The process of decision-making always includes a risk component among other factors. Insurance companies base their operations on this concept of risk. These companies have developed numerous actuarial methods and models to balance revenues and costs, attain profit goals, and maintain solvency simultaneously. 

Insurance companies' business transactions are a vital part of every country's economy. A state establishes regulations and procedures to define the legal framework of their business activities, with the primary objective of reducing risks and ensuring the stability and safety of financial flows. 

To maintain solvency, insurance enterprises establish various reserves. Technical reserves are used to cover future insurance contract liabilities. These reserves act as a foundation for balancing expected risks such as damages, insured sums, and compensations. Insurance companies also gather additional capital funds, known as guaranty reserves, to cover unexpected risks like catastrophic events and unforeseen business losses. 

As institutional investors, insurance companies invest these reserve funds in the financial market. The main market risk management during the investment process involves balancing assets and liabilities to maintain long-term solvency. 

Insurance companies' business operations are also affected by various other risks, including strategic, operational, credit, and legal risks. Identifying, classifying, and monitoring these risks requires a deep understanding of risk management methodologies and specific aspects within insurance companies. Research indicates that the practical application of risk management is key to improving business performance.
