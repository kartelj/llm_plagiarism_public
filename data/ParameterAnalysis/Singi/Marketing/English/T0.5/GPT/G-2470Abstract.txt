The overhaul of the primary education system in Serbia and Yugoslavia between 1944 and 1959, from the conclusion of World War II to the implementation of the General Education Law in 1958, resulted in the establishment of a standard eight-grade primary school across the country, a structure that remains in Serbia today. This reform was a product of the "struggle for school" that began in Serbian society in the late 19th century, and is intertwined with the fight for modernization and democratization of Serbian and Yugoslavian society in the 20th century. 

The reform that led to the creation of the uniform eight-grade primary school in 1958 was part of the "new school" struggle. It's worth noting that work on defining new education and upbringing policies and initiating new reforms of the existing education systems began right after World War II, largely due to the efforts of UNESCO, a UN organization. 

The continuation of the "new school" struggle, which had been disrupted by the world wars, was particularly spurred by the "new" recognition of childhood, which had suffered significant losses during World War II. The reform of the primary education system between 1944 and 1959 was part of the struggle for societal cultural transformation, initiated by the revolutionary, communist government of Yugoslavia upon the establishment of the first government organs. 

The journey towards a better, fairer, socialist society required political stabilization, which was impossible without economic recovery or, as often emphasized, "overall societal progress", encompassing "cultural life". "Cultural life", and "educational life" as an essential component, was deemed a crucial part of the "socialist transformation of society" from the outset. 

The decisions made at the Fifth Congress of the CPY (1948) had profound effects on the country's cultural and education policies, which received their primary directives with the Resolution of the Third Plenary Session of the CC of the CPY, adopted in December 1949. All state institutions, especially schools, were expected to adopt the new education policies and contribute to the struggle for the man of socialism. 

Schools had to depend on a complex system of mass organizations, notably the Pioneer Organization, and "reliable" party cadre, as well as numerous experts in psychology, pedagogy, film, arts, literature, and music who were associated with the Council of Societies for Child and Youth Care of Yugoslavia. They also relied on the millions of parents "neglected" in the previous century, who, like all other citizens of the socialist community, had a role to play in building socialism. Thus, the "new" education policy contributed to the perception of school as the foundation for societal modernization, cultural revolution, and socialist construction.
