The PhD thesis explores the understanding and application of ethics in integrated marketing communications across various marketing arenas, beginning with advertising, marketing research, marketing modeling, promotional mix, and communication with the target audience, with a particular emphasis on children and youth. The research findings indicate the potential impact of brand products on purchasing decisions, media preferences and choices made by young people, attitudes towards advertising, and the examination of consumer and materialistic attitudes in children, particularly when influenced by advertising. 

The communication strategy of a company engaged in children's products and services differs from that of a company employing a general communication strategy. The use of an integrated marketing communication model for young people requires adherence to ethical principles, regulations, and codes when conducting marketing activities aimed at children. 

The primary hypothesis suggests that through integrated marketing communications, mass communication is abandoned in favor of targeted contact with both existing and potential customers in an ethical manner. Supplementary hypotheses explore the effects of advertising on young people, the impact of branded products and services on children's purchasing decisions, the occurrence of parent-child conflicts due to frequent exposure to advertising, the comparison between the world depicted in advertising and reality, and the potential increase in materialistic values in children as a result of advertising stimuli. 

The findings reveal that younger students (lower grades of primary school) have a more positive attitude towards advertising and preference for branded products and services compared to older students (higher grades of primary school). It was conclusively found that frequent exposure to advertisements prompts young people to ask for purchases, leading to increased parent-child conflicts. Most children do not believe that the world portrayed in advertising mirrors reality. It was confirmed that children's materialistic values increase due to advertising stimuli.
