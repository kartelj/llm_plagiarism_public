Over the past six decades, tourism has shown a positive growth trend due to various favourable factors. Despite facing several setbacks from crises triggered by both economic and non-economic factors, tourism has demonstrated a significant potential for recovery, often outpacing the general growth of the global economy. Since the start of this century, tourism has been impacted by numerous crises, and it is likely that this trend will continue in the future. This thesis examines the effect of these crises on tourism, focusing on their impact and causes. It pays special attention to the repercussions of the global financial and economic crisis that began in 2008 on the tourism sector. A specific survey was conducted to understand its effect on Serbian tourism, and the results are discussed in this thesis. Moreover, it proposes specific strategies to counteract the potential negative impacts of future crises on the tourism sector.
