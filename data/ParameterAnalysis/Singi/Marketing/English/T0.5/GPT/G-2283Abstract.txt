The aim of this research is to assess the competitiveness of Serbia's economy, the efficacy of its competitiveness policies, and the role of clusters in enhancing regional competitiveness. To examine these hypotheses, methodologies from the World Economic Forum, the Center for Strategy and Competitiveness, the University of Stockholm, and the European Cluster Observatory were employed. The objective of analyzing how robust clusters contribute to regional competitiveness was to find a correlation between the strength of clusters in regions, as measured by the location quotient, and GDP per capita as a productivity indicator, in the following five countries, also known as G-5: Hungary, Bulgaria, Greece, Romania, and Serbia. The data used in this study were collected from the Statistical Office of Serbia, EUROSTAT, the World Economic Forum, and the European Cluster Observatory. The findings reveal that Serbia's competitiveness indicators are deteriorating, particularly when compared to other countries at a similar development level, and that measures for competitiveness policy are weak and insufficient. In the G-5 countries, 13 out of the 20 cluster categories analyzed demonstrated a positive correlation between regional cluster strength and regional competitiveness.
