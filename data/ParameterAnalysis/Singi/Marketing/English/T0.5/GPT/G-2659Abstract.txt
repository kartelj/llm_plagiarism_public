The study of tourism competitiveness, particularly in relation to tourist destinations, has become a significant area of research for both the scientific community and the destinations themselves. Current market trends dictate the progress of these tourist destinations, necessitating the provision of high-quality experiences that set them apart from their competitors. To enhance their attractiveness and secure a more competitive standing, destinations must focus on creating these superior experiences. 

Destination management plays a crucial role in effectively and efficiently utilizing all available resources, guided by sustainability principles. It is also responsible for developing clear and effective strategies for destination product development, adding value to the tourist experience. Achieving a superior competitive position requires ongoing assessment of a destination's competitiveness, employing various evaluative techniques to measure past, present, and future competitiveness. 

This measurement process forms the foundation for destination product development in modern tourism. The results obtained help establish the destination's standing relative to its competition, guiding future development and addressing current competitive weaknesses. As such, the first step in determining a tourist destination's competitiveness involves rating competitiveness indicators to create a framework and guidelines for future tourism development and competitive positioning. 

This research paper proposes that continuous competitiveness measurement is a vital component of the tourist destination management process. The dissertation focuses on the competitiveness of tourist destinations and the indicators used to measure this competitiveness, with a special focus on Serbia as a tourist destination. It lays the groundwork for a model that could be used for ongoing competitiveness assessment of Serbian tourism in the future. 

The adapted integrated model of destination competitiveness proposed here is used to measure Serbia's competitiveness as a tourist destination. The conclusions highlight the factors and indicators of competitiveness that Serbia should prioritize in its future development. The findings shed light on Serbia's strengths and weaknesses in terms of its competitive positioning as a tourist destination.
