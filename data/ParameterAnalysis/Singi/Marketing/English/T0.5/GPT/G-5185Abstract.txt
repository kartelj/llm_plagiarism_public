The goal of enhancing business performance through process optimization and cost reduction is a common objective in every business system. Previous improvements relied on the implementation of cutting-edge technologies, but these primarily focused on specific business areas, such as equipment maintenance using work orders and troubleshooting result analysis. These improvements did not consider the whole process, from defect notification to defect elimination. Consequently, the suggested solutions were partial and sometimes resulted in entirely inaccurate analysis outcomes. 

The proposed solution is centered on outlining a method to encompass the entire process, selecting the most efficient standard for logging, analyzing, and optimizing the process, and choosing a suitable data format that aligns with the analyzed process and the recorded objects during the process. The solution thus relied on the application of the appropriate standard for that type of process, achieved through multi-criteria analysis and review of relevant professional literature. It also utilized a data warehouse as a general data structure, and after further analysis, adopted object process data warehouse with target analysis parameters and defined limit values.

The key findings from the analysis revealed that the chosen standard for process recording offered a crucial foundation for optimization and that the object process data warehouse provided a high-quality, realistic database. The transformation of data from a relational structure to a data warehouse structure resulted in a simplified structure that allowed dynamic data access, grouping, and specialization. Additional extensions related to threshold and target values fully justified the applied concept.

This concept demonstrated that, contrary to the initial belief that the maintenance system was highly successful (with equipment uptime >95%) when only considering the work order, over 30% of interventions resulted in troubleshooting delays when the entire process was taken into account.
