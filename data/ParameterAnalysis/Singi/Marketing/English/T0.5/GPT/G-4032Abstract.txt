The Interplay of Economic Growth and Energy Efficiency: A Model and Meta-Analysis

The connection between energy efficiency, energy use, and economic growth is a global phenomenon, which is also evident in Serbia. This theory has been validated by establishing a correlation between energy efficiency and Serbia's economic growth. It has been proven that there is a quantifiable causal relationship between energy consumption and economic growth, which is also applicable to Serbia. 

The indicators and their variations of energy efficiency in Serbia suggest that the rebound effect is relevant in this context. It also indicates that energy consumption can be used as a substitute for energy efficiency in determining its correlation with economic growth. 

A thorough and systematic review of existing literature using meta-analysis has highlighted factors that result in varying conclusions in the energy-growth nexus research. These factors include differences in research design, political stability, economic structure, level of economic development, and climate. 

The link between energy consumption and economic growth in Serbia is causal, multifaceted, and dependent on the type of energy utilized. The findings align with Serbia's status as a transitioning economy and its predominantly service-based sector. The research also revealed a significant energy-saving element when establishing a causal link between the total final energy consumption and the gross domestic product. 

There is an evident need to introduce new tools and policies to enhance energy efficiency. Energy consumption should be incorporated into all growth and development models. Comprehending the influence of energy consumption and energy efficiency on economic growth and development is crucial for devising suitable economic, energy, and environmental policies.
