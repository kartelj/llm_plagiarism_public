The global crisis has directly impacted all transitioning countries, including ours, leading to decreased investments, foreign investor withdrawal, and increased debt. Despite the rise in non-performing loans, the banking sector in Bosnia and Herzegovina has managed to withstand the more severe repercussions of the economic crisis, largely due to its conservative policies that avoid unnecessary risks and maintain profitability. 

An analysis of the stock exchange operations in Bosnia and Herzegovina reveals phases of establishment, growth, and decline in turnover, which is not solely due to the economic crisis but also a result of internal factors. The banking sector, a significant component of the overall financial system, is mostly privatized and dominated by foreign private capital, with deposits being the primary source of business operations and loans being the main product. 

Given that loans are the most frequently used form of fund placement and play a dominant role in banking, credit risk poses a significant problem in cash flow and bank liquidity. This is partially the focus of the thesis. To maintain a high-quality loan portfolio, bank management devises a clear loan policy that maximizes profitability within an acceptable risk framework. 

The thesis examines the dynamics of non-performing loans in Republika Srpska, based on data from the Banking Agency of Republika Srpska's reports for the period 2009 â€“ 2016. The study's goals were to test econometric theory, provide empirically-based results, and predict future values. 

Considering the nature and development of business operations in Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well as the current economic conditions, the banking sector pays most attention to controlling credit risk, liquidity risk, and foreign exchange risk. Sophisticated market assessments are not yet applicable due to the lack of a market for many asset items. 

Foreign investors began showing interest in the region's banking market in the early 2000s, influenced by factors such as developed financial and credit markets, GDP levels, low inflation rates, economic growth, and productivity. The potential for returns played a key role in attracting these investors, leading to their dominance and increased competitiveness. German, Austrian, Italian, and French banks showed the most interest. The entry of foreign banks brought anticipated benefits, such as the introduction of new technologies and innovations, improved competitiveness and infrastructure, and more foreign investors. Banks with majority foreign capital outperformed local banks by providing better services.
