This research concentrates on the effects of water usage on agriculture in Libya, along with the resulting ecological indicators. Libya, being mostly a dry and arid nation with about 95% of its land covered by the Sahara desert, relies heavily on groundwater, which makes up about 95% of its water resources. The majority of its arable and pasture lands are found in the narrow northern Mediterranean coastal line. The country's water resources are scarce due to the lack of surface water resources and other sources like water desalination and wastewater treatment. 

Agriculture contributes to about 9% of Libya's GDP and consumes 85% of the total water supply and 12% of electricity. These facts point to mismanagement and unsustainable practices in the agriculture sector. Three ecological indicators were selected to understand the environmental impacts of water usage in agriculture: water consumption, land use, and water pollution. The environmental sustainability index, according to these indicators, is poor due to the high water consumption rate in agriculture, particularly in the densely populated northern region. 

This has led to serious environmental issues like seawater intrusion with groundwater, water pollution, and soil salinization. Excessive groundwater usage in the southern region has also resulted in a drop in the groundwater level in the upper layers, leading to the drying of some desert lakes. 

To mitigate the damage caused by water usage in agriculture, a sustainable solution has been proposed, which involves using seawater as a renewable and sustainable water source. The idea is to exploit seawater for coastal desert agriculture in Libya by using salt-tolerant plants, especially those used for animal feed. 

This research will discuss how seawater can be used as a renewable resource for water and agriculture in Libya, and how it can contribute to sustainable development in the country. The main reasons for exploiting seawater include the lack of underground water inventory in coastal areas, the fluctuating rainfall rate, the high population density in coastal areas, and the need to conserve groundwater and surface water resources. 

A sustainable approach has also been suggested to generate energy from the movement of water across the Great Man-Made River (GMR) pipeline using appropriate-sized turbines. Another sustainable approach involves converting the GMR from a freshwater supply to a large agricultural project after establishing several seawater desalination plants to meet the freshwater needs of cities. 

Transitioning from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources for power generation is crucial, as agricultural expansion leads to increased groundwater and fuel consumption, resulting in greater environmental pollution. This research explores other sustainable, clean, and environmentally friendly energy sources, such as the movement of water across the GMR pipe and the movement of vehicles on roads, also known as Smart Roads. These techniques represent a wise policy direction towards exploiting new technologies for clean, renewable, and sustainable energy.
