The research paper, "Investment Performance Evaluation of the United States Equity Thematic and Sector Mutual Fundsâ€™ Portfolios," has dual objectives. The academic aim is to dissect, scrutinize and explain the investment performance of hypothetical portfolios made up of mutual funds with defined stock universes, based on officially sanctioned investment strategies. The societal aim is to propose a suitable methodology for assessing investment performance, which could form the basis for regulatory standards and offer value to a broad spectrum of internal and external stakeholders. The employed research methodology incorporated two sets of models for attributing investment performance, specifically factor and asset-based models. The first group included the capital asset valuation model, three-factor Fama-French model, Carhart model, and five-factor Fama-French model. The latter group used Brinson-Hood-Beebower and Brinson-Fachler models, along with geometric models. The study, which focused on thematic mutual funds, comprised 240 individual funds in the United States. Mutual funds were evaluated both individually and at the portfolio level using a 2x2 matrix of market capitalization and investment style. Each portfolio analyzed contained 60 investment funds from a specific investment theme. Factor-based models were used to identify dominant market factors. Asset-based models confirmed the results of factor models for the prevailing investment style. For all factors observed, their effects on mutual fund portfolios and individual mutual funds were determined. Expected influences based on original models included market premium, company size, momentum, and company profitability. Unexpected influences were investment style and company investment conservatism. The results also revealed a variation in excess returns by sector and the presence of momentum in these returns. This suggests that investment philosophies have influenced investment strategies beyond simple passive sector tracking. Portfolio annual rebalancing significantly improved returns when a dominant market investment style was anticipated. This was supported by results from exposure to thematic mutual funds and annual sector allocation effects in sector mutual fund research. Analysis of exposure to observed factors and portfolio structure revealed potential inconsistencies with stated investment strategies. Analysis of the research results concluded a high level of consistency at both the portfolio and individual level based on factor influences from the applied models. Applying asset-based models, which use portfolio structure and benchmark data, yielded results that could be more useful and better aligned with the investment decision-making process. The combined use of factor and asset-based models confirmed current market trends and provided insights that factor models alone could not. The limitations of arithmetic models for attributing investment performance over multiple periods were overcome by geometric models. This allowed for the successful connection of multi-period returns using geometric attribution models, without residuals, ensuring consistent attribution effects across different periods.
