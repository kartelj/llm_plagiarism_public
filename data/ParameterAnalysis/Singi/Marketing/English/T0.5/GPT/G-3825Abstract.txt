Wine tourism, a growing global niche, should be a key component in Serbia's tourism offerings, particularly given the country's lack of mass tourism attractions, including wine regions. This study examines wine tourism's global impact and its potential role in Serbia's tourism sector, focusing specifically on the Vrsac region. The aim is to identify opportunities and challenges for developing wine tourism in Serbia through research, analysis, and comparison. 

The study includes a comparative analysis of the relevance of different aspects of wine tourism supply and marketing activities for two distinct groups: visitors/wine tourists and winery managers. The methodology involves identifying the characteristics of wine tourism, defining its unique features, analyzing Serbia's wine tourism supply, studying the role of marketing in wine tourism development, and assessing the attitudes of visitors/tourists and winery owners/managers towards supply and marketing activities. It also involves identifying the pros and cons of Serbian wine tourism.

The research results reveal what wine tourism is, its role in niche tourism and the development of specific tourism destinations, the importance of strategic marketing and supply segments for the development and quality positioning of Serbia and Vrsac's wine tourism on target markets, the effectiveness of particular marketing tools for the development, promotion, and positioning of Serbian and Vrsac's wine tourism, and the most effective marketing channels for communicating messages from wine tourism suppliers in Serbia and Vrsac to target markets. The study also identifies the key stakeholders in the development of wine tourism in Serbia and Vrsac.

The research concludes that while wine tourism is still in its infancy in Serbia, it holds significant potential to boost the country's overall tourism offerings. However, winery owners and managers are not fully utilizing marketing opportunities, which could threaten the survival and growth of this tourism sector. Conversely, this also presents the opportunity to attain a desired market position through education and proper application of knowledge.
