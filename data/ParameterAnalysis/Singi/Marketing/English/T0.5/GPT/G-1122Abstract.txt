The findings of this thesis highlight the significant and diverse role that tourist guides play in modern tourism, particularly in showcasing destinations and attractions to visitors. Tourist guiding, which is often chosen willingly by customers, takes the form of guided tours. Its informal nature allows for effective communication of information, sentiments, and knowledge. A high-quality and secure tourism experience provided by a guided tour involves the interaction of the tourist guide, the tourists, and the environment at a specific location and time. This interaction results in various relationships between the tourists and the environment, the tourists and the guide, as well as among all three parties. The guide's narrative and group management skills significantly impact the tourists' experience. Therefore, it can be argued that tourist guides influence not only the quality of a destination's overall tourism product but also the offerings of individual tour operators and travel agencies. Their role in the tourism system is characterized by their ability to manage and coordinate tourism experiences, promote destinations, and achieve sustainable and responsible tourism goals. The way tourist guides present and interpret a destination significantly affects how their customers experience a place or attraction, understand the local culture, participate in tourist activities, and behave during their stay. As a presenter and interpreter, the tourist guide serves as a representative and "ambassador" of the destination in the eyes of the tourists. Their influence determines whether tourists feel welcomed, decide to extend their stay, or plan a return visit. They can shape tourists' perceptions of a destination and sometimes even become a symbol of the destination. Undeniably, tourist guiding is a crucial strategic factor in the successful presentation of destinations in modern tourism, significantly affecting the tourism experience, the duration of stay, and the resulting economic and social benefits.
