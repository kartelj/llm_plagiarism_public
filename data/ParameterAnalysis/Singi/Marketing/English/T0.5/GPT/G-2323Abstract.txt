The technological infrastructure and factor intensity of Serbia's merchandise export have seen enhancements between 2000 and 2014. However, these improvements were not significant enough to transform the domestic export structure and pave the way for robust, enduring growth. The quality of Serbian merchandise exports, gauged by the proportion of higher-level processed goods, substantially trails behind European Union countries and, to a lesser degree, transitioning Central European economies. 

This study examines the quantitative shifts in the technological infrastructure and factor intensity of domestic merchandise exports by assessing changes in the propensity of shares of skill-intensive manufacturing and high and 'medium-high' technology products in total exports from 2000 to 2014. 

In order to diversify export offerings, it's crucial to incorporate modern technology and investments, particularly through Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), into competitive sectors. Comprehensive reforms in employment policy regulations and the science and education system are required. A focused industrial policy, sector and firm-level strategies are needed to stimulate a transition towards technology-intensive activities, which have higher spill-over effects. 

For Serbia, export-led growth is vital and necessitates an expansion of foreign trade. The institutional framework for expanding foreign trade is already in place, as evidenced by the Stabilization and Association Agreement with the EU and CEFTA. It's important for Serbia that euro area import demand is expected to grow moderately in 2015 and 2016, despite the fact that imports are limited due to sluggish total euro area demand and the recent depreciation of the euro. 

This research highlights the importance of external environmental factors and competitiveness strategies, and their relationship with the identified critical competitiveness indicators of small and medium-sized enterprises in transition economies. By adapting to the environment and eliminating key environmental obstacles through the implementation of appropriate competitive strategies, the strategic positioning of small and medium-sized enterprises in the transitional context can be improved to enhance their competitiveness.

Serbia needs to adopt a new concept of systemic competitiveness, which encompasses both political and economic factors that contribute to successful industrial development. This concept involves the deliberate creation of conditions for successful industrial development by state and social actors. It differentiates between four levels: the micro level of the firm and inter-firm networks, the meso level of specific policies and institutions, the macro level of generic economic conditions, and the meta level of slow variables such as socio-cultural structures, the basic economic order and orientation, and the capacity of social actors to formulate strategies.
