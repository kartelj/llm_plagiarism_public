This  thesis  focuses  on  the  impact  of  water  use  on  agriculture  in  Libya,  and   ecological  indicators  resulted  from  this  use.  Libya  is  mostly  dry  and  arid  country,  the   Sahara desert  covers  about  95% of  Libyaâ€™s land,  most of the arable and pasture lands   are located in the northern part of the narrow Mediterranean coastal line.   The water resources are considered scarce, based on the scarcity of surface water   resources and other sources as the water desalination and wastewater treatment,  Libya   depends  heavily  on  groundwater,  which  amounts  to  approximately  95%,  the  country   floating on the vast reserves of non-renewable groundwater, the world largest system of   Nubian Sandstone aquifer is located under the southern part of the Libyan desert.   Agriculture sector contributes to about 9% of the GDP, it consumes 85% of total water   supply  and  12%  of  electricity,  so  these  indicators  show  on  mismanagement  and   unsustainable management in the agriculture sector.   Three  ecological  indicators  have  chosen  to  know  the  environmental  impacts  of  using   water in agriculture, these indicators are: 1) Water consumption (drain) indicator;      2)   Land  use  (drain)  indicator;  and  3)  Water  pollution  indicator.  According  to  these   indicators  the  environmental  sustainability  index  is  not  good,  because  the  water   consumption index in agriculture is the most dangerous to the environment, especially   in  the  northern  region,  densely  populated,  the  use  of  water  in  agriculture  led  to  the   emergence  of  serious  environmental  problems,  among  which  the  most  important  are:   seawater  intrusion  with  groundwater,  water  pollution,  and  soil  salinization.  Also  the   environmental  impacts  of  excessive  use  of  groundwater  in  the  southern  region  is  the   decline in the groundwater level in the upper layers, which led to dry some desert lakes.   To  reduce  the  size  of  damage  caused  by  use  of  water  in  agriculture,  it's  suggested            a  sustainable  method  to  treat  the  problem  of  water  depletion.  It's  adopted  that  the  sea   water is a renewable and sustainable source of water; the idea was about the possibility   of exploitation  sea water in  the agriculture of coastal deserts in  Libya by use some of   salt-tolerant  plants  (Halophyte)  especially  that  used  to  feed  animals.  This  thesis  will   present a study of how to use seawater as a renewable resource for water and agriculture   in  Libya  and  how  this  will  contribute  in  sustainable  development  in  this  sprawling   country.   The most significant reasons that force us to exploit the seawater are:    1.  Lack  of  inventory  of  underground  water  in  the  coastal  areas  and  overlapping   with seawater in several areas. In contrast, Libya has the longest coastline on the   Mediterranean with a length of more than 1,900 kilometers.    2.  Fluctuation rate of the amount of rainfall, which has affected negatively on the   natural grassland.    3.  More  than  90%  of  the  country's  population  in  the  coastal  areas,  that  causing         a large drain of groundwater which already meager in this region, for this reason   the government  has  worked to  establish  Great  Man-Made River project,  which   delivers water from the south to the northern areas to reduce this problem.    4.  Conservation of inventories of groundwater and surface water, because they are   non-renewable sources of water.   Energy generation; a sustainable approach is suggested to take advantage of Great Man-  Made River (GMR) to generate energy from water movement across Great Man-Made   River pipeline by using appropriate sizes  of turbines.  It's  known that the length  of the   GMR pipeline is about 4,000 km, with diameter of 4 meters. Pipeline of such magnitude   with  great  water flow rate will make a one turbine produces hundreds of Kilowatts of   clean  energy,  the  most  significant  reasons  that  force  us  to  take  advantage  of  GMR  to   generate  energy:  1)  The  needs  to  sustainable  environmental  energy  source;    2)  Power   System uses energy of flowing water to provide a consistent, controllable, non-weather-  dependent  source  of  electricity,  such  as  other  types  of  renewable  energy,  which  are   dependent on weather.   Agriculture; a sustainable approach is suggested to take advantage of Great Man-Made   River (GMR) to produce food. Conversion GMR from supplying freshwater to coastal   cities  into  huge  agricultural  project  after  establishment  many  seawater  desalination   plants (solar powered) in order to provide the needs of cities from fresh water. Thus it   becomes possible to convert thousands of desert hectares around the pipelines to huge   agricultural project irrigated from GMR.   The transition from dependence on fossil fuels to renewable energy sources for power   generation is very important, because agricultural expansion means more consumption   of  underground  water,  more  fuel  consumption,  which  leads  to  a  greater  environment   pollution. Solar energy is a promising renewable energy source in Libya, but this thesis   has looked for other sustainable, clean and environmental friendly energy sources, thus   the  diversity  of  renewable  energy  sources  promotes  economic  and  environmental   security.  This  thesis  concentrated  on  below  techniques  to  generate  power  from:  1)   Movement of water across the GMR pipe;  2) Movement of vehicles on roads, which is   called  Smart  Roads.  These  techniques  have  considered  wise  policy  and  increases  the   variety  of  sustainable  energy  sources,  and  this  step  is  in  right  direction  towards   exploitation  of  available  new  technologies  to  get  a  clean  energy,  renewable  and   sustainable.
