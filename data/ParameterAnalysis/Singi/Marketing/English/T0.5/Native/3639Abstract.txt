The goal of this dissertation is to point to the possibility of using the ARIMA model in predicting prices of crude oil, then the possibility of managing market risk in oil companies with VaR method, as well as their implementation in a complex system of managing companies in the production, processing and distribution sector of crude oil. The aim of management of any company, as well as oil companies is maximizing profitability, achieving its programed rate or continuous achievement of gain regardless of time and business conditions. While maintaining market risk in acceptable limits it's a crucial task that conditions management to take corrective methods in time and minimize risks while optimizing sources of funds, taking into consideration amounts, deadlines and prices. The achieved results support the claim that oil companies need to use acceptable models for predicting movement of oil prices and maintaining risks in doing business with crude oil in order to maintain market risk at an acceptable level, in acceptable limits, which is a good basis for brining future decisions in business entities in unstable times. Further directions of research will include implementation of other existing, as well as new models, methods and their combination, testing of extreme events for predicting crude oil prices and maintaining market risks in doing business of companies in production, processing and distribution sector for crude oil. In order to secure continuity in supply and maintenance of obligatory reserves of crude oil at a required level, future research will include risk of a country and energetic security as a precondition for function of the economy and all of its subjects, as well as potential users of this limited resource.
