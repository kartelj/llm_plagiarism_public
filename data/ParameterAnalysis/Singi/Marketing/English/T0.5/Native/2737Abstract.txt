Serbia has a diverse structure of tourist attractions, it has a long history and preserved  resources.  However,  Serbia’s  tourism  products  have  not  been  adequately  developed  and  commercialized in the international market. In order to better position them, it is necessary to  increase competitiveness, which requires large financial resources.   Same  as  many  developing  countries,  Serbia  also  sees  in  foreign  investments  the  opportunity for the development of this sector, modernization of the tourist offer, increase in  export, employment and income as well as for prevention of migrations from underdeveloped  regions, where tourism, due to well-preserved resources, can often be the only opportunity for  development.   In this dissertation, a comprehensive analysis of the factors significant for attraction of  foreign  investments  in  Serbia’s  tourism  is  carried  out,  followed  by  benchmark  analysis  of  selected  competitive  countries  in  order  to  find  out  how  they  raised  the  share  of  foreign  investments in tourism and what results are achieved in this sector in those countries, as well  as  to  understand  what  is  the  competitive  position  of  Serbia  in  relation  to  these  countries.  Based  on  results  of  research  through  questionnaires,  it  is  revealed  how  fulfilled  are  the  attractiveness  factors  for  attracting  foreign  investments  into  tourism  of  Serbia  and  what  are  the  critical  factors  that  should  be  primarily  improved.  The  research  carried  out  through  questionnaires  indicates  whether  the  level  of  attractiveness  of  Serbian  tourism  satisfies  foreign  investors,  and  which  other  critical  factors  are  to  be  worked  on  in  priority.  Final  research will be on the competitive surroundings of the local tourist destination applying the  Porter’s  Five  Forces  model  adapted  for  this  purpose,  identifying  opportunities  for  strengthening the destination’s position in relation to the five forces to determine its strengths,  weaknesses,  opportunities  and  threats,  and  to  define  the  strategy  for  attraction  of  foreign  investments, in order to improve its competitiveness.   This dissertation is intended to assist in finding the answer to the question of how to  attract  foreign  investments  in  Serbia’s  tourism,  that  is,  what  measures  should  be  taken  in  order to improve the existing environment that would raise the competitiveness of this sector.
