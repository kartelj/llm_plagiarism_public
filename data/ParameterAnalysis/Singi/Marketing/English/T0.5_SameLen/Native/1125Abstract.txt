Structure of the  financial system  has  been undergoing significant changes  for  several  decades.  These  changes  are  reflected  in  changed  significance  of  some  financial  institutions  types,  integration  of  different  groups  of  financial  activities  at  the  level  of  complex financial institutions, and enlarged scale and scope of their activities. Powerful  usage  of  bank  and  other  financial  institutions  mergers  and  acquisitions  occurs  in  the  context  of  financial  sector  restructuring.  Huge  rise  in  the  number  of  mergers  and  acquisitions of banking institutions in developed EU countries has been considered as an  integral  part  of  global  processes  such  as  bank  re-composition  and  bank  expansion,  but  also  as  a  result of  creating  single  financial  market  initiated  by  launching  euro  as  single  currency. Increase  in competitiveness  in the real  and  financial sector is  fundamental  for  strengthening  bank  mergers  and  acquisitions  aimed  to  increase  business  efficiency  and  profitability in the context of globalization.   While  bank  mergers  and  acquisitions  in  developed  EU  countries  signified  proprietary  rights transfer between shareholder groups of private owners,  in transition countries, on  the  other  hand,  there  were  usually  acquisitions  of  former  state-owned  banks  mostly  by  foreign  banks  from  developed  EU  countries.  The  economic  aspect  of  banking  sector  in  transition  consists  of  the  increased  efficiency  and  profitability  of  banks,  contemporary  financial technology implementation and modern methods for risk management.   In order for the mergers and acquisitions to be successfully completed, suitable projection  and  evaluation  of  mergers  and  acquisitions,  and  implementation  of  appropriate  post- acquisition integration strategy would necessarily need to be carried out.
