Tourism and hospitality play an increasingly important role in the economies of a large number of countries, while investment in infrastructure is rapidly contributing to overall development. It is the infrastructure and broad range of tourist products and services that enable the slowing down and stopping of the process of devastation and the decay of rural areas.  Interactivity and personalization are a basic platform for digital changes, which are an unstoppable process in terms of globalization and hypermobility of the labor market. In such an environment, tourism and hospitality companies advertise the need to fill vacancies, focusing their activities on segmented auditoriums, based on numerous digital data on potentially interested individuals. At the same time, non-linear forms of communication and sharing of advertising content enable interested individuals to, based on their interests and competencies, reach a large number of advertising content.  Research conducted for the purposes of the doctoral dissertation confirmed that the media cannot be viewed only as passive transmitters of one-way messages, as well as that their interactivity provides feedback from a changing labor market. Data on the use of social networks during the human resources recruitment process confirmed their irreplaceability as relevant communication platforms.  In the constant confrontation of two extremes, between the long-term development function strongly generated by convergent media communications, and short-term economic interests, tourism and hospitality companies need a well-planned and organized strategy for attracting candidates who meet the required conditions in terms of knowledge, experience and skills.
