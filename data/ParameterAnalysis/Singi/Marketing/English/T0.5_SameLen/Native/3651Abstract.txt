The importance of preserving natural ecosystems that provide a variety of ecosystem services to mankind is becoming an increasingly common topic both from the scientific and the practical point of view. The aim of this paper was to establish the diversity, potentials, significance and condition of all components of natural ecosystems in the larger protected areas of Libya. It proposes models of conservation and sustainable use of natural ecosystems in the protected areas of Libya, especially from the aspect of their long-term conservation and sustainable development of local communities in current complex and difficult economic and political situation in Libya. Protected areas of Libya are important areas of natural values, but also a resource that, if sustainably used, can provide significant ecosystem services, that is, it benefits the local population. The following values and resources of the protected areas of Libya are analyzed: abiogenic factors (relief, geological background, soil, water, climate), biogenic factors (flora and fauna, vegetation), population (composition and structure, socioeconomic characteristics, traditional the way of life, traditional and contemporary activities, possible directions for the sustainable development of local communities in accordance with natural values and traditional way of life, as well as the significance of the protected areas of Libya for the strategic development of the state. strategic documents, and above all, a strategy for sustainable development, conservation of biodiversity, combating desertification, fisheries development and other strategic documents of importance for integral environmental, nature and interest policies of the local population In order for Libya to join countries that have adopted the national the sustainable development strategy should be made possible by the development of a competitive market economy and balanced economic growth, development and education of people, increased employment and social inclusion, infrastructure development and balanced regional development, protection and improvement of the environment and rational use of natural resources. Based on the study of two groups of respondents in two protected areas in Libya, we can conclude that the protected areas in Libya are a source of natural values and resources that provide ecosystem services to the local population because most respondents from the local population group have confirmed that it benefits from the use of resources from the protected area, which primarily relate to sources of food for families, or to the sale of food to tourists who occasionally visit both sites that were the subject of research. By setting the correct relationship to the values and resources of the protected areas, their long-term protection, improvement and use is ensured because the resources from the protected areas that were the subject of the research are used in a sustainable manner and there is no excessive exploitation thereof (although these resources are relatively limited). Harmonized development of local communities in protected areas contributes to the strategic development of the state has not been fully proven because local communities in the research areas are too small. With the development of tourism in Libya, this situation will be improved to a greater extent, but it is necessary beforehand to develop awareness of environmental protection in people who do not live close to protected areas through education at all levels, from the youngest ages. A necessary condition is also the implementation of international obligations and the adoption of national strategies with the achievement of a higher level of ecological responsibility through the fulfillment of legislative, institutional, personnel, technical and other assumptions, in accordance with international and national practice.
