Economic Progress and Energy Efficiency: Examining the Connection and Meta-Analysis The correlation between energy efficiency, energy use, and economic progress is evident, both globally and specifically in Serbia. This theory has been validated by determining a connection between energy efficiency and economic expansion in Serbia, confirming that the link between energy use and economic growth is causal and measurable, and illustrating that this causality is also applicable to Serbia. Energy efficiency indicators, along with their fluctuation patterns in Serbia, have indicated that the rebound effect is relevant in this context and that energy consumption can be used as a stand-in for energy efficiency when establishing a cause-and-effect relationship between efficiency and economic growth. A thorough and methodical literature review through meta-analysis has pinpointed factors that result in varying findings in energy-growth nexus studies; these factors include differences in research methodology, as well as the stability of political institutions, economic framework, degree of economic progress, and climate. The link between energy use and economic growth in Serbia is causal and multifaceted, contingent on the kind of energy utilized. Findings align with Serbia being a transitioning economy, but are also significantly impacted by its predominant services sector. Studies have revealed a substantial energy-saving element when determining a causal link between total final energy consumption and gross domestic product. There is an undeniable need to contemplate new tools and policies to bolster energy efficiency improvement. Energy consumption should be incorporated into any growth and development blueprint. Comprehending the effects of energy consumption and energy efficiency on economic growth and development is crucial for devising suitable economic, energy, and environmental policies.
