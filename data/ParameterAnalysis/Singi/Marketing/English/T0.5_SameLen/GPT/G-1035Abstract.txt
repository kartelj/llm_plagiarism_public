This paper's objective is to evaluate the impacts of various balance sheet and off-balance sheet factors on the interest rate risk exposure of banks in both developed and emerging financial markets. The quantification of this exposure aids in the identification, monitoring, and management of interest rate risk. We surveyed 65 bank holding companies in the U.S. as a representative sample of a developed financial market, while our emerging market sample included 10 Serbian banks listed on the Belgrade Stock Exchange. A comparative analysis of balance sheet characteristics' influence was performed using Stone's regression model and the econometric panel model results. The application of these models supports the argument that factors like bank size and deposit share in total assets have a statistically significant yet contrasting effect on banks in developed and emerging markets. For instance, asset growth in U.S. banks increases their interest rate risk exposure, whereas in Serbian banks, the effect is reversed. Likewise, a rise in the deposit share in total assets reduces U.S. banks' interest rate risk exposure, but Serbian banks experience a different outcome. Some factors, such as an increase in return on average equity (ROAE) and a decrease in net interest income, have a similar impact on reducing banks' exposure to interest rate risk, irrespective of the market's development level.
