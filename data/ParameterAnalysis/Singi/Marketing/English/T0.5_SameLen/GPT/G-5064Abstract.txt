Modern retail is greatly influenced by dynamic business conditions. The surge in demand, and subsequently revenue, necessitates a swift and accurate response from the company to all market challenges if it desires business growth. A fast-paced retail model suggests there's no inventory shortage issue as delivery delays lead to missed sales, customer dissatisfaction, and a drop in competitive edge. This paper's primary aim was to chart the influence of demand forecasting on inventory management, and outline a universal methodology for demand prediction and inventory control. It's within this context that a systematic scientific and theoretical analysis of nearly all inventory management determinants has been conducted. A detailed examination of the importance of multi-criteria demand management for inventory control outlines key factors for studying demand forecasting efficiency. The primary research objective was to pinpoint the unique aspects of demand in current business conditions, and subsequently illustrate the effective use of the forecasting methodology as a crucial element of inventory management. A business not relying on demand forecasting as a stock management aspect won't last long. The study was grounded on data from the retail store of Winwin Shop Čačak, forecasting demand for 4 product categories across over 100 retail stores, accounting for over 40% of total sales. The research findings revealed that demand forecasting is crucial for boosting retail efficiency in contemporary business environments. The multi-criteria method, the Analytical hierarchical process, serves as the mathematical foundation for the study, while its software support, the Expert Choice software solution, was used to estimate and predict future product demand. The results further affirm the importance of demand forecasting in optimizing stock, hence improving company performance. However, the influence of subjectivity on the demand forecasting process can be reduced, but not entirely eliminated.
