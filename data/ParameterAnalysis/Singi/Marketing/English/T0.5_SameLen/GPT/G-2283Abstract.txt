The aim of this research is to evaluate the competitiveness of Serbia's economy, the effectiveness of its competitiveness policy, and the role clusters play in enhancing regional competitiveness. To examine these hypotheses, methodologies from the World Economic Forum, the Center for Strategy and Competitiveness, the University of Stockholm, and the European Cluster Observatory were utilized. The goal of analyzing the impact of strong clusters on regional competitiveness was to establish a correlation between the strength of clusters in different regions, measured by the location quotient, and GDP per capita as a measure of productivity, in the following five countries (also known as G-5): Hungary, Bulgaria, Greece, Romania, and Serbia. The statistical data used for this study was collected from the Statistical Office of Serbia, EUROSTAT, the World Economic Forum, and the European Cluster Observatory. The findings reveal that Serbia's competitiveness indicators are deteriorating, particularly when compared to other countries at a similar level of development, and measures for competitiveness policy are weak and inadequate. In the G-5 countries, 13 out of 20 cluster categories analyzed showed a positive correlation between the strength of clusters in the regions and regional competitiveness.
