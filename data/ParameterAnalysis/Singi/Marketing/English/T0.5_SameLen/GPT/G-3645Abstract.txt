Over recent decades, cruise tourism, a subset of nautical tourism, has seen significant growth. Examining the geographical distribution of cruise destinations reveals that this form of tourism is globally developed. While it undoubtedly has positive implications such as fostering unity, promoting understanding, and generating financial benefits, cruise tourism also has some negative impacts. Therefore, strategic management of this tourism type is crucial, especially in alignment with sustainable development principles. This paper provides an in-depth analysis of the current state of cruise tourism, focusing specifically on the municipality of Kotor, its potential, pros and cons, strategic advancement, and its competitive standing in the global cruise tourism market. The author highlights how cruise tourism enhances the town's offerings and its positive economic impact. The author's survey captures the views of Kotor's economic sector and populace on the role and significance of cruise tourism. The findings indicate that cruise tourism is seen as a crucial component of Kotor's tourism, potentially positioning Montenegro as a globally renowned tourist destination. However, the respondents feel that cruise tourism is underdeveloped and acknowledge the need to stimulate this sector's growth. The primary positive outcomes identified were economic growth for local communities and job creation. The key socio-cultural benefits include exposure to new cultures and showcasing local traditions and customs. However, the most pronounced negative impact is the degradation of natural resources. The respondents hold the state largely accountable for amplifying the positive and mitigating the negative effects of cruise tourism, necessitating stronger legislative regulations. Emphasizing education about cruise tourism's importance and enhancing dialogue among major stakeholders to respect local community needs is of utmost importance.
