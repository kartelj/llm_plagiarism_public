The dissertation explores the significance of sustainability in contemporary destination governance practices in alpine and dinaric mountain locales. Initially, a comparison is drawn between the application of sustainability in destination governance by destination management organizations (DMO) in the Alps and the Dinarides. Quantitative data gathered through a survey was utilized to examine the disparities in the two areas concerning the application of sustainability principles in destination planning, leadership/management methods in destination governance/management, destination development priorities, and the value attributed to various stakeholder types. Subsequently, a comparison is drawn between the two most advanced mountain destinations in Serbia, Kopaonik and Zlatibor, using the integrated framework for sustainable tourism indicators. This approach identified areas for improvement and provided recommendations for both destinations. Finally, an interview-based research delves deeper into the methods and resources available for implementing sustainable tourism in the German Alps, serving as a model for alpine regions that can inform the development of mountain tourism in the Dinarides. The interviews addressed topics such as strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats in the destination; sustainability projects, initiatives, and plans; key stakeholders in sustainable tourism, natural resources and their conservation; indicators of sustainable development; cross-border collaboration, and the topic of ecotourism, which emerged as a significant issue during the interviews.
