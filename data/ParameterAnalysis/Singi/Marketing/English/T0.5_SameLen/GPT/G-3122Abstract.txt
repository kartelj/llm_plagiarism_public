Serbian spas are a significant tourism product, appealing to both domestic and international tourists. This tourism sector is continually evolving in its offerings and in meeting tourist demands. The increasing sophistication of tourist demands and their desire for relaxation and recreation in Serbian spas necessitates that tourism providers adapt to stay ahead of the competition. One way to become competitive and recognizable is to use a mix of communication methods to reach potential tourists. Despite growing interest, potential spa-goers are often geographically distant from these services, necessitating effective communication about the services and amenities Serbian spas offer. Modern information technology has significantly benefited both tourists and tourism providers in promoting spa tourism. Marketing professionals in Serbian spas benefit from easier, cheaper, and more comprehensive contact with potential tourists. Tourists benefit from easy access to information about spa offerings and the ability to share images and other content about their spa experiences. This research focuses on traditional and digital communication methods and their use in promoting Serbian spas and as information sources for potential spa-goers. Analysis of selected spa destination web presentations revealed that all spas have websites, but they are not fully leveraging the promotional potential of this medium. Analysis of social media usage, including Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest, and Google+, revealed inconsistent usage. Communication professionals do not regularly update information and content, underestimating its importance. Research into the influence of traditional and digital communication on spa destination choices aimed to test a hypothesis about the optimal mix of traditional and digital communication methods for targeting potential Serbian spa visitors. The results showed that tourists typically choose Serbian spas based on television advertising and recommendations from friends. In terms of digital media, tourists use Facebook and websites as information sources. For successful Serbian spa tourism development, it is crucial that marketing professionals use an appropriate mix of traditional and digital communication methods.
