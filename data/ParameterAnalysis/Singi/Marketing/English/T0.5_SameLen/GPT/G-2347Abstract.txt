The focus of this thesis is the effect of water usage on Libyan agriculture and the resulting environmental indicators. Libya, primarily a dry and arid nation, is dominated by the Sahara desert which covers about 95% of its land. The majority of its fertile and grazing lands are situated in the northern part of its narrow Mediterranean coastal line. Libya's water resources are scarce, due to limited surface water resources and other sources like water desalination and wastewater treatment. The country heavily relies on groundwater, which accounts for approximately 95% of its water supply. Libya sits on vast reserves of non-renewable groundwater, including the world's largest system of the Nubian Sandstone aquifer located beneath the southern part of the Libyan desert. 

The agricultural sector, contributing around 9% of the GDP, consumes 85% of the total water supply and 12% of electricity. This highlights mismanagement and unsustainable practices within the sector. Three environmental indicators were selected to understand the environmental impacts of water usage in agriculture: 1) Water consumption (drain) indicator; 2) Land use (drain) indicator; and 3) Water pollution indicator. According to these indicators, the environmental sustainability index is poor, primarily due to the water consumption index in agriculture, especially in the densely populated northern region. This has led to severe environmental issues such as seawater intrusion into groundwater, water pollution, and soil salinization. Overuse of groundwater in the southern region has also led to a decrease in the groundwater level in the upper layers, resulting in the drying up of some desert lakes.

To mitigate the damage caused by water usage in agriculture, a sustainable solution to the problem of water depletion is proposed. Seawater is considered a renewable and sustainable water source. The idea is to exploit seawater for coastal desert agriculture in Libya using salt-tolerant plants (Halophytes), especially those used for animal feed. This thesis will explore how seawater can be used as a renewable resource for water and agriculture in Libya, and how this can contribute to sustainable development in this vast country.

The most compelling reasons to exploit seawater include: 1) The lack of underground water inventory in coastal areas and its overlap with seawater in several areas. Libya has the longest coastline on the Mediterranean, stretching over 1,900 kilometers. 2) The fluctuating rainfall amount, which has negatively impacted natural grassland. 3) More than 90% of the country's population lives in coastal areas, leading to a significant drain on already scarce groundwater. To address this, the government has initiated the Great Man-Made River project, which delivers water from the south to the northern areas. 4) The need to conserve groundwater and surface water inventories, as they are non-renewable water sources.

The transition from reliance on fossil fuels to renewable energy sources for power generation is crucial, as agricultural expansion leads to increased consumption of underground water and fuel, resulting in greater environmental pollution. Solar energy is a promising renewable energy source in Libya. However, this thesis also explores other sustainable, clean, and environmentally friendly energy sources, thereby promoting economic and environmental security. This thesis focuses on generating power from 1) the movement of water across the GMR pipe; 2) the movement of vehicles on roads, known as Smart Roads. These techniques are considered a wise policy and increase the variety of sustainable energy sources. This step is in the right direction towards the exploitation of new technologies to obtain clean, renewable, and sustainable energy.
