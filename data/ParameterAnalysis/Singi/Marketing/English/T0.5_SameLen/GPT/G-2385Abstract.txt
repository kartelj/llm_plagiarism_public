Mobile phone usage is on a steady rise. Looking at the evolution of mobile devices, it's clear that manufacturers have created highly advanced devices that can be accurately labeled as smartphones. Their increased functionality and impact on daily life have made us increasingly reliant on these modern mobile phones. Smartphones are used for various purposes such as phone calls, internet browsing, using different services like SMS, MMS, email, camera or GPS. With the progression of mobile technology, the first security issues have emerged, affecting the communication channel, or the data transfer from sender to recipient. The security risks for these devices are growing due to a lack of sufficient security mechanisms and protective tools. The use of mobile phone operating systems has further complicated this issue. Each operating system offers numerous benefits to users, but also introduces several security vulnerabilities. Given the increasing popularity of internet access via mobile devices, there are risks associated with secure communication and establishing communication channels. With the widespread use of mobile devices, it's crucial to address mobile communication security for all users. Open source projects provide developers with a wide range of options for creating their own solutions based on their ideas. Access to an operating system's source code has led to an operating system that has outperformed all others and become a global market leader in mobile phones. The Android operating system quickly gained popularity among developers and beyond, as it's based on the Java programming language. Android serves as an open platform for mobile devices, allowing modifications even at the operating system level. This gives developers the chance to develop unique security mechanisms that aren't typically found on other mobile platforms. The Android operating system is based on the Linux operating system and is part of an Open Source Association. In the seven years since its creation, up until the writing of this paper, the Android operating system has advanced to version 7.0. This paper analyzes Android's security mechanisms, identifies certain shortcomings, particularly in the low-level security framework surrounding the system. Survey results indicate a lack of user knowledge regarding mobile phone internet safety. A detailed analysis of the Android operating system and its security mechanisms reveals the need for enhancing Android's security framework. Suggestions for improvements and enhancing security using SE Linux have been proposed. A comparison was made and differences between the AOSP (Android Open Source Project) and the proposed SE Android (Security Enhanced) system are outlined. Finally, the paper concludes with future work directions.
