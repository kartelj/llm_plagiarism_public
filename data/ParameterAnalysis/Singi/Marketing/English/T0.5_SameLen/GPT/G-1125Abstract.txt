The financial system's structure has been experiencing major shifts for many decades. These shifts manifest in the altered importance of certain financial institution types, the merging of various financial activity groups within complex financial institutions, and the expansion of their operations. The prevalent use of bank and other financial institution mergers and acquisitions is part of the financial sector's restructuring. The significant increase in bank mergers and acquisitions in developed EU countries is viewed as a component of global processes like bank re-composition and expansion, as well as a consequence of the single financial market's creation initiated by the euro's introduction as a single currency. Enhanced competitiveness in the real and financial sector is crucial for bolstering bank mergers and acquisitions aimed at improving business efficiency and profitability in a globalized context. While bank mergers and acquisitions in developed EU countries represented a transfer of ownership rights among private owner groups, in transition countries, they typically involved former state-owned banks being acquired primarily by foreign banks from developed EU countries. The economic facet of the banking sector in transition involves increased bank efficiency and profitability, the adoption of contemporary financial technology, and innovative risk management methods. To successfully complete mergers and acquisitions, it is essential to properly plan and evaluate them and implement an appropriate post-acquisition integration strategy.
