Over the past six decades, tourism has experienced a largely positive growth trend, thanks to a range of favourable factors. Despite facing several periods of crisis, driven by economic and non-economic reasons, tourism has shown a notable resilience, recovering at a faster rate than the global economy. It has been impacted by crises since the start of this century, and it is likely to continue facing them in the future. This thesis explores the impact of crises on tourism, examining their causes and effects. It pays special attention to the effects of the global financial and economic crisis that began in 2008 on the tourism industry. A specific survey was conducted to assess its impact on Serbian tourism, and the findings are included in the thesis. Furthermore, the thesis proposes certain measures to counteract the potential negative impacts of future crises.
