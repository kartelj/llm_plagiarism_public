The investigation into the effects of solar attacks, conducted for this dissertation, revealed that even the most sophisticated electric power system (EPS) defenses are ill-equipped to handle severe solar storms. Factors such as the Earth's weakening magnetosphere, the 2003 South African solar storm which occurred at a latitude similar to Serbia's, the targeted weakening of Venezuela's EPS by the United States in 2019 aimed at destabilizing the country, and Serbia's own complex security situation, have all underscored the urgency for a strategic overhaul of the Serbian Electric Power Company to bolster its resilience. The extensive flooding in May 2014 that incapacitated the "Kolubara" and "Nikola Tesla A" Thermal Power Plants (TPP) for an extended period, further underscored the vulnerability of the Serbian EPS to natural disasters. A comprehensive study of EPS failures suggests that a system reliant on a smaller number of large electric energy (EE) producers exposes a weak link in the EE transmission to consumers, specifically the potential for high voltage transformer saturation to immobilize the entire EPS for 12 to 16 months (as per Lloyd's report). In South Africa, certain EPS components only resumed operation after four years. Threats to economic stability, accompanied by significant social upheaval and chaos, are increasingly being weaponized in hybrid warfare aimed at undermining state security systems. A review of Serbian publications revealed that the Serbian EPS is modern and transitioning from a few TPPs to a greater number of renewable energy sources (RES) producers by 2030. Given Serbia's complex security situation in the Balkans, it is crucial that it avoids exposing any vulnerabilities. This dissertation introduces a new "stand by" approach to establishing energy independent communes (within an existing EPS) that will leverage the strong development of underutilized industrial energy. Only large manufacturing companies can rapidly enhance their backup EE power supply systems, converting their thermal units into small thermal power plants and transforming a local distribution network into an independent virtual network with its own EE producers that will serve as the backbone of energy independent local administrative units. Research on the shift in awareness among Serbian managers regarding the 2017 and 2018 solar storms (before and after widespread media coverage) indicated the need for a new model for creating energy-independent companies to expedite the implementation of energy independent communes. The model's operational mechanism hinges on the senior managers of leading companies, their exceptional performance and influential positions, combined with memetics and crony capitalism. The model's effectiveness was validated by a hypothesis and a fourth survey conducted among senior management in Serbia. This dissertation also offers practical solutions for protection from solar proton events and highlights the lack of research on health issues caused by solar storms in Serbia.
