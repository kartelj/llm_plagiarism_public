The focus of this thesis is a study of profitability, pinpointing key profitability determinants and their influence on agricultural businesses in the Republic of Serbia. It provides a theoretical perspective on the distinctiveness of agriculture and agricultural production, its economic development significance, and the role and value of agricultural businesses for agricultural progress. The distinction between conventional and contemporary methods of gauging company performance is clarified, and the fundamental principles of these two methods are presented and theoretically expounded. The thesis includes both theoretical and empirical investigations. The theoretical scrutiny of the research topic is reinforced by study findings from domestic and international authors, while empirical analysis was carried out using regular financial reports on the activities of agricultural businesses and various reports on individual macroeconomic variable trends. The sample comprised 151 agricultural businesses involved in primary agricultural production, with the study spanning 2014 to 2018. Statistical profitability analysis of these businesses indicated that the examined agricultural businesses were generally successful, generating profit throughout the entire observation period. Profitability analysis from various indicator perspectives revealed company differences in success, with these disparities also evident over time. Besides establishing profitability levels and existing differences in profitability among individual agricultural businesses, this thesis primarily aimed to identify the reasons (factors) why some businesses are profitable and others are not. In the process of identifying statistically significant profitability determinants, commonly used determinants in most studies measuring enterprise profitability impact were utilized. The following internal profitability determinants that the company can influence were considered: company size, liquidity, indebtedness, sales growth, and asset tangibility. Additionally, the impact of the following external profitability determinants, which the company cannot influence, were examined: gross domestic product and inflation. To address numerous questions arising from this objective, the econometric panel model technique was employed, as it observes data from both temporal and spatial aspects, providing abundant information, efficiency of evaluated indicators, and conclusion objectivity. Prior to concluding on the influence of individual determinants on profitability, it was confirmed that all variables used in this study are stationary, that there is no high correlation among them, i.e., there is no multicollinearity issue, and that there is no heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation problem in the regression model. Moreover, based on the executed statistical tests and the demonstrated statistical significance of these tests, it was concluded that the fixed effect regression model is the most suitable. Finally, it was discovered that company size, as a profitability indicator, has a positive and statistically significant impact on the return on assets rate, while liquidity, indebtedness, gross domestic product, and inflation have a negative and statistically significant impact on profitability. The remaining two factors, sales growth and asset tangibility, do not have a statistically significant effect on the return on assets rate (profitability). The findings of this empirical study will assist the management of the analyzed businesses and other users in making future business decisions more easily.
