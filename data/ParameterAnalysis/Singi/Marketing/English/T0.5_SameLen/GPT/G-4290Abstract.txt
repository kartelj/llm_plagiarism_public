In today's economic climate, international finance is essential for meeting societal needs and ensuring the smooth functioning of modern societies. This dissertation focuses on the role of international financing, specifically by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), one of Europe's leading investment organizations, and its impact on Serbia's market and economy. International financing, as we understand it today, began in Central and Eastern European countries in 1990 with the establishment of the EBRD to assist transitioning countries. In Serbia, international investment organizations have been crucial since 2001 when international sanctions were lifted. Without this financial assistance, Serbia's economy and transition process following economic sanctions and a significant drop in Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in the 1990s would have been much worse. Complex economic relationships, new technologies, and production necessitate additional financing, the main focus of this dissertation. The study aims to explore the significance and necessity of foreign investment institutions and their contribution to economic growth. Central and Eastern European countries have had successful partnerships with the EBRD through investment loans, co-financing of projects, joint ventures in various sectors, primarily energy, infrastructure, transport, financial sector, and transforming these economies into market economies and integrating them into the future unified European market. The research concludes that without strategic and well-planned borrowing from international financial institutions, monitored and controlled appropriately, a national economy cannot recover. Fiscal sustainability and monetary stability are crucial for such financing due to the complexity of business relations and opportunities. Cost-effective, reliable international investments stimulate economic growth and development. Transitioning economies cannot progress without additional international financing. It's worth noting that economies that partnered with the EBRD experienced significant economic growth and better business outcomes compared to recession periods. Despite the benefits of partnering with the EBRD, the professional public in Serbia is not fully aware of the importance of this cooperation, highlighting the need for a rational approach to the country's credit indebtedness. The dissertation also examines the impact of EBRD-led investments on Serbia's economic recovery and transition, finding a positive correlation between these investments and Serbia's GDP growth rate. The analysis confirms the EBRD's significant role in economic recovery and transition through financing and advisory services. The dissertation highlights the benefits of partnering with the EBRD and emphasizes the need for specific actions and measures to enhance this cooperation.
