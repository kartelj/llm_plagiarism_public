Tourism competitiveness, including the competitive nature of tourist destinations, has become a critical research area for both academics and tourism destinations. Current market trends shape the growth of these locations, necessitating the provision of high-quality experiences to distinguish them from competitors. To become more appealing and maintain a competitive edge, destinations must curate exceptional experiences. Destination management's role is to effectively and efficiently utilize all available resources in line with sustainability principles, and to establish clear, effective strategies for destination product development to enhance the tourist experience. To improve a destination's competitive standing, it's crucial to consistently evaluate its competitiveness using various assessment methods, whether they evaluate past, present, or future competitiveness. In today's tourism industry, measuring competitiveness forms the foundation for developing destination products. The measurements yield results that determine a destination's position relative to its competitors, forming a basis for guiding development and addressing current competitive shortcomings. As a first step in defining a destination's competitiveness, competitiveness indicators are ranked to create a framework and guidelines for future tourism development and competitive positioning. The research thesis posits that ongoing competitiveness measurement is a vital component of the tourist destination management process. This dissertation focuses on tourist destination competitiveness and competitiveness measurement indicators, with a particular emphasis on Serbia as a tourist destination. This study lays the groundwork for creating a model for the continuous measurement of Serbian tourism's competitiveness in the future. Thus, the adapted integrated model of destination competitiveness proposed here is used to measure Serbia's competitiveness as a tourist destination. The conclusions highlight the factors and indicators of competitiveness that Serbia should prioritize in future development. The results reveal the strengths and weaknesses of Serbia's competitive position as a tourist destination.
