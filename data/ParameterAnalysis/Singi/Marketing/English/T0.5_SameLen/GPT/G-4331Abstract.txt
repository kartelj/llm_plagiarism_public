Examining the practical and theoretical challenges of motivation, the question arises: Is it enough for organizations to only concentrate on managing motivation through financial incentives and external factors to enhance performance and employee satisfaction? This thesis begins with the self-determination theory, pointing to the existence of varying types of motivation with differing levels of self-determination. According to its principles, the various forms of motivation are organized along a motivation continuum. At one end of this continuum lies the most autonomous, or most self-determined type of motivation - intrinsic motivation. At the other end, we find amotivation, or the absence of motivation. Various extrinsic motivations exist between these two extremes, each varying in their degree of autonomy and self-determination. This thesis presents the application of the self-determination theory's primary principles to a group of employees in the hospitality industry of the Republic of Serbia, with the goal of advancing motivational techniques and methods. The author investigates how social environmental factors like work environment and job type influence the structure of motivation (autonomous/regulated/amotivation), and how this motivation affects job satisfaction and individual wellbeing. The study was carried out on a group of employees at 4 and 5-star hotels in Belgrade. The gathered data was analyzed using the statistical program SPSS, version 23. Descriptive analysis (mean, standard deviation), Cronbach Alpha Coefficient for scale reliability, and statistical conclusions were used for data analysis. Pearson correlation coefficient, T-test, and variance analysis were used to examine connections and differences based on measured characteristics. This thesis's research validates the application of the self-determination theory's principles in a work setting.
