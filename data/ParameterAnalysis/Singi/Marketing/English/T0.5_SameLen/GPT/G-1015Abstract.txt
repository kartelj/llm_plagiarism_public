Wine is a distinct product of Montenegro's agriculture, characterized by its relatively low domestic consumption and substantial contribution to exports. Concurrently, the wine sector in the nation, marked by unique grape and wine features in certain regions, underscores the importance of this industry in overall agricultural output and to a significant portion of the population. 

The objectives of this study include investigating and scientifically validating strategies to enhance the marketing of this product domestically. To achieve this, considerable efforts are required to improve quality, promote sales channels, and undertake numerous other activities. Conversely, considering past performance in wine exports and regional destinations, as well as shortcomings in foreign market promotion, a plethora of measures are proposed to sustain and boost export levels, and increase sales of high-quality wines by expanding the market. This includes examining the potential for exports to promising markets such as the USA, Canada, Japan, and China. 

It is anticipated that wine production, a traditional agricultural sector, will contribute to the development of agriculture and the nation's economy. Therefore, it is crucial to enhance all marketing activities, which have been somewhat overlooked in the past in relation to wine production and sales.
