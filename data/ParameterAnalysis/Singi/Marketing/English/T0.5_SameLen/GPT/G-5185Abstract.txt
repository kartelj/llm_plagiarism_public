From the perspective of process optimization and cost reduction, the issue of business enhancement is a common objective for all business systems. Recent advancements have relied on the application of the latest technologies, focusing mainly on a single business aspect like equipment upkeep via work orders and troubleshooting results analysis. However, these improvements did not consider the entire process, from defect notification to defect elimination. As a result, the suggested solutions were partial and sometimes resulted in completely inaccurate analysis outcomes. The proposed solution is centered on outlining a method to encompass the entire process, selecting the most optimal standard for recording, analyzing, and optimizing the process, and choosing a suitable data format that aligns with the analyzed process and the documented objects during the process. Therefore, the solution was founded on the application of the suitable standard for that kind of process, which was accomplished by applying multiple criteria analysis and analyzing the available scholarly literature, then applying a data warehouse as a universal data structure, and with additional analyses, the object process data warehouse was adopted, with target analysis parameters and defined limit values. The primary outcomes derived from the analysis demonstrated that the application of the chosen standard for process recording provided a crucial base of elements required for optimization, that the application of the object process data warehouse provided a high-quality and realistic database. By converting data from a relational to a data warehouse structure, a straightforward structure was achieved that allowed dynamic access to data and its dynamic grouping and specialization, and additional extensions related to threshold and target values fully justified the applied concept. This concept illustrated that from the initial point that the maintenance system is very successful (equipment uptime at >95%) when only the work order is observed, there were indications that in over 30% of interventions, when looking at the complete process, there are delays in troubleshooting.
