The technological framework and intensity of Serbian product exports saw improvements between 2000-2014. Yet, these changes did not significantly enhance the domestic export structure, thus failing to establish a solid foundation for robust, sustainable, long-term growth. The quality of Serbian product exports, as seen through the proportion of higher-level processed goods, significantly lags behind EU countries and, to a lesser extent, transitioning Central European economies. This paper examines the quantitative shifts in the technological framework and intensity of domestic product exports, focusing on the trends in shares of skill-intensive manufacturing and high and 'medium-high' technology products in total exports from 2000-2014. The transfer of advanced technology and investments, particularly through FDI, into competitive sectors is crucial to broaden the export offer. A revised approach to employment policy regulations and a comprehensive overhaul of the science and education system are required. A focused industrial policy, sector, and firm-level strategies are needed to propel a shift towards technology-intensive activities with higher spill-over effects. Export-led growth, vital for Serbia, necessitates an expansion of foreign trade. The institutional conditions for foreign trade expansion are already in place (the Stabilization and Association Agreement of the EU with Serbia, as well as CEFTA). For Serbia, it is important that euro area import demand is anticipated to grow moderately in 2015 and 2016, despite imports being restricted by the muted growth of total euro area demand and some downward impact from the recent depreciation of the euro. This research highlights the importance of external environmental factors and competitiveness strategies and their correlation with the identified critical competitiveness indicators of small and medium-sized enterprises in transition economies. Therefore, by adapting to the environment, i.e., by eliminating key environmental obstacles through the implementation of appropriate competitive strategies, the right conditions for the strategic positioning of small and medium-sized enterprises in the transitional context are created to enhance their competitiveness. Serbia needs a fresh concept of systemic competitiveness. The concept of systemic competitiveness aims to encompass both the political and economic determinants of successful industrial development. It refers to a scenario where state and social actors consciously create conditions for successful industrial development. The concept differentiates between four levels: The microlevel of the firm and inter-firm networks, the mesolevel of specific policies and institutions, the macrolevel of generic economic conditions, and the metalevel of slow variables like socio-cultural structures, the basic order and orientation of the economy, and the capacity of social actors to formulate strategies.
