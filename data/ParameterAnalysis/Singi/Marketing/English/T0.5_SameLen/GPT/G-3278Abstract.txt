In cruise tourism, there's a growing trend where cruise companies are increasingly prioritizing the quality of the cruise experience, as it significantly influences tourist satisfaction and future behavior. Recognizing the importance of cruise experience quality, this thesis will explore its nature, including its precursors and outcomes. The research issue involves developing a deeper comprehension of the cruise experience's nature and identifying a methodological tool for measuring its precursors and outcomes. The author of this thesis has opted for a comprehensive approach to testing the service theater model (cruise ship performance) and service quality (quality dimensions), which can be leveraged to design a successful quality cruise experience. The research is grounded in postmodernism, postpositivism, and interpretivism research philosophies and employs suitable quantitative and qualitative data gathering techniques. Consistent with the research philosophies, the research approach in this thesis is viewed as a blend of induction and deduction. The conceptual model was tested using structural equation modeling. The findings revealed that employees, guests, service setting, and service quality are the precursors of the cruise experience. However, only experienced emotion positively affected overall satisfaction and influenced future behavior. The cruise experience's nature is a relatively unexplored topic in academia. Therefore, this study can be said to have contributed to the ontology of cruise experience quality and the development of the theory of cruise experience quality. The research was conducted on a cruise ship in collaboration with the guests, ensuring all aspects of practical application were considered. Consequently, the research findings bear managerial significance due to the data collected, research outcomes, insights, and practical recommendations.
