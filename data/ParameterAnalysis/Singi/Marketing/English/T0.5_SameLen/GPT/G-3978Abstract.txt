Financial hardship and bankruptcy can negatively impact a company's management, owners, suppliers, workers, consumers, and other stakeholders. Efficient bankruptcy law, through the process of bankruptcy reorganisation, aids in the survival of insolvent but economically viable firms. Key issues include the impact of financial hardship and bankruptcy reorganisation on essential corporate governance mechanisms, and how these changes, in conjunction with bankruptcy regulations and time in bankruptcy, affect the effectiveness of implemented reorganisation strategies. This dissertation's aim is to explore the impact of financial hardship and bankruptcy reorganisation on critical corporate governance mechanisms in large and medium-sized firms that implemented a reorganisation or pre-pack reorganisation strategy in the Republic of Serbia from January 2009 to June 2015. It also examines the effectiveness of the implemented reorganisation and pre-packaged reorganisation strategies, with the goal of identifying factors that can aid in the recovery of the Serbian corporate sector. Of the 83 sample firms, 18 experienced changes in ownership structure, while 32 saw changes in top management structure. In the firms studied, the pre-bankruptcy ownership structure changed following the implementation of the reorganisation strategy, while top-management turnover remained relatively stable during both the bankruptcy period and the first year following the implementation of the reorganisation strategy. A logistic and OLS regression analysis indicates that two factors influenced change in the pre-bankruptcy ownership structure: the company’s liquidity and whether the owners were involved in running the distressed company prior to declaring bankruptcy. Also, results of the logistic and OLS regression provided evidence that the company’s size and applied bankruptcy procedure influenced top-management turnover in Serbian large and medium-sized distressed companies. The influence of all other observed variables on pre-bankruptcy ownership and top-management structures was deemed to be statistically insignificant. Regarding the success of bankruptcy reorganisation in the Republic of Serbia, this dissertation's findings show that 75% of observed companies are still reorganising while 25% of companies applied for bankruptcy after the adoption of the reorganisation strategy or pre-packaged reorganisation strategy. Establishing a creditor’s board or other similar body with fewer members after the implementation of a reorganisation strategy or pre-packaged reorganisation strategy can increase the success of bankruptcy reorganisation in the Republic of Serbia. Overall, the results of the analyses in this dissertation suggest that bankruptcy reorganisation could be used as an effective mechanism for the rehabilitation of the corporate sector in transition economies. However, this process has to be supported with changes in corporate-governance practice and institutional and legal reforms.
