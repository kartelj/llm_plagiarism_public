Serbia is primarily involved in the process of aligning with the European Union's acquis, creating a system that aligns and harmonizes national technical laws with EU laws. The country has reached a commendable level of compliance with key EU waste management directives. However, practical application is still in its initial stages, despite some progress in waste collection and sanitary landfill disposal. Waste management is a major responsibility of the state, with the primary aim of the program being to minimize environmental pollution and utilize waste as a resource. EU environmental protection regulations are detailed, specific, and comprehensive, yet flexible enough for member states to adapt implementation to their constitutional and institutional order. Serbia's existing hazardous waste treatment infrastructure is not ready to meet the requirements of the directives based on the EU's New and Global approach. Developing and adapting methods and new technologies, building plants for new technology application in special hazardous waste treatment, and professional training is a lengthy and costly process. Therefore, it is necessary to mobilize all available resources at the national level to aid in harmonizing and implementing environmental protection and waste management legislation, which will benefit human health, economic development, and meet current and future generational needs. The hazardous waste management system in Serbia reveals a total lack of any form of hazardous waste treatment and location. This paper was written to propose a solution for the disposal and complete destruction of hazardous waste, a historic issue for many Serbian companies. The proposed plant's hazardous waste treatment will focus on the disposal of PCB oil, Ni-Cd batteries, biodegradable waste, etc. The paper outlines the current hazardous waste situation, accompanying legal regulations, a solution and methodological procedure for total waste disposal using plasma technology, and converting energy into heat and electricity, as well as a comprehensive business consumption model that would be profitable.
