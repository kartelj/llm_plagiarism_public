Wine tourism, a specific interest tourism sector experiencing considerable expansion globally, should be a key aspect of Serbia's tourism offerings. This is particularly important given Serbia's limited mass tourism appeal, which includes wine regions. This study investigates the global impact of wine tourism and its role in Serbia's tourism offerings, focusing on the Vrsac region. The research aims to identify opportunities and potential for Serbia's wine tourism development through analysis and comparison. During the investigation into wine tourism, a comparative analysis was conducted on the importance of wine tourism supply and marketing activities for two distinct groups: visitors/wine tourists and winery managers. The research methodology includes identifying wine tourism traits, defining its unique features, outlining the basic characteristics, analysing Serbia's wine tourism offerings, examining the role of marketing in wine tourism development, comparing the attitudes of visitors/tourists and winery owners or managers towards the importance of supply and marketing activities, and determining the strengths and weaknesses of Serbian wine tourism. After analysing the research findings, the research objectives have been achieved and it has been established what wine tourism is, its role in special interest tourism and specific tourism destinations' development, the role of strategic marketing and specific supply segments for the development and quality positioning of Serbia and Vrsac's wine tourism offerings on target markets, the effectiveness of specific marketing tools for development, promotion and positioning of Serbia and Vrsac's wine tourism, the most effective marketing channels for communicating messages from Serbia and Vrsac's wine tourism suppliers to target markets while also defining the most important stakeholders in Serbia and Vrsac's wine tourism development process. The research concludes that despite being in its early stages, wine tourism has substantial potential to enhance Serbia's overall tourism offerings. However, winery owners and managers have not fully utilised marketing opportunities, which could threaten this tourism sector's survival and development. Conversely, it presents an opportunity to achieve a desired market position through education and appropriate knowledge application.
