The thesis delves into a largely untapped area of the effect of printing and packaging operations on the attributes of printed flexible packaging materials, alongside identifying their measurements through suitable multicriteria assessment techniques. Experimental analysis of flexible packaging materials has been conducted, with their degrees of alterations assessed and contrasted. In the study and evaluation, constraints have been established, mainly concerning the chosen kinds of packaging materials and the nature of the packaged items. The outcome of this assessment is a clear aggregate of the values of different versions of printed flexible packaging materials, where the satisfaction of the criteria for each food product can be computed for every material.
