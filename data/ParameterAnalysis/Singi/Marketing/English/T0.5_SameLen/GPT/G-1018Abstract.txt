The thesis titled 'Issues in Valuing Small and Medium Enterprises at Different Life Cycle Stages' made a significant contribution by linking two unexplored aspects of business economics in a methodological sense. The research's subject and objective were stressed in the INTRODUCTION, along with the problem, hypothesis, methodology, and expected research contribution. The initial section, THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK: A REVIEW OF CURRENT RESEARCH ON THE INTERACTIONS BETWEEN DEVELOPMENT STAGES AND VALUATION OF SMALL AND MEDIUM ENTERPRISES, highlighted the importance of small and medium businesses for economic growth, especially in transitional and post-transitional countries dealing with mergers, reengineering, restructuring, and downsizing. These modern business challenges can be met with a suitable policy for small and medium enterprise development. Understanding that different stages of business development come with unique problems is crucial for studying its impact on business value. To adequately link these two areas for examination, methodical concepts and methodologies for valuing small and medium enterprises and diagnosing their development stage were systematized within the methodological framework. Methodical concepts for valuing small and medium enterprises include methods and methodology for their valuation. This paper employed the method of assessing book value, yielding value, and determining liquidation value. The methodology comprises three stages: preparation, implementation, and closing. Methodical concepts for diagnosing small and medium enterprise development include models and methodology for diagnosis. Models used in this paper include those for identifying metamorphic change, behavioral change, and structural change. The methodology includes three stages: development management, development diagnosis, and development direction. The second part, Methodological Framework: Review of Current Methodology in the Field of Interaction of Development and Valuation of Small and Medium Enterprises, discusses the choice of methodological framework. The St.Gallen methodology was used to provide a sequential overview of four standard ideal development models with proposed criteria. For a sample of 55 small and medium enterprises, it was determined whether they belonged to one of the four phases. Fifteen businesses were excluded from the sample because their phase could not be determined. The remaining 40 were placed in the four standard phases, each consisting of 10 enterprises. The book, yielding, and liquidation values were assessed and determined for each enterprise. Following this, the performance of small and medium enterprises was evaluated using Klariceks DF and Belaks BEX models, and future predictions were made using Klarickes Quick Test model. In the third section, APPLICATIVE FRAMEWORK: REVIEW OF CURRENT RESEARCH IN THE FIELD OF INTERACTION OF DEVELOPMENT PHASES AND VALUATION OF SMALL AND MEDIUM ENTERPRISES, hypotheses were tested, particularly the central hypothesis and four auxiliary hypotheses. The validity of the interaction of development phases and the selection of the proposed methodology were discussed. In the CONCLUSION, a synthesis of the research was presented, along with the most important findings and recommendations for future research.
