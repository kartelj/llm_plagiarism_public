The paper titled “Investment Performance Evaluation of the United States Equity Thematic and Sector Mutual Funds’ Portfolios” has dual objectives. The academic aim is to dissect, scrutinize and elucidate the investment performance of hypothetical portfolios made up of mutual funds with specified stock universes, grounded on formally recognized investment strategies. The societal aim is to offer a suitable methodology for investment performance assessment, which would serve as a foundation for establishing regulatory standards, and also deliver value to a broad spectrum of internal and external stakeholders. The employed research methodology incorporated two sets of models for investment performance attribution, specifically factor and asset-based models. In the first set, the models used were: capital asset valuation model, three-factor Fama-French model, Carhart model, and five-factor Fama-French model. In the second set, Brinson-Hood-Beebower and Brinson-Fachler models were employed, along with geometric models. The study, which focuses on thematic mutual funds, encompassed 240 individual funds in the United States. Mutual funds were examined at both the individual and portfolio level based on a 2x2 matrix of market capitalization and investment style. Each portfolio examined consists of 60 investment funds of a specific investment theme. Using factor-based models, the dominant market factors were identified. Additionally, the application of asset-based models corroborated the findings of factor models for the prevalent investment style. For all observed factors, the impact on mutual fund portfolios and individual mutual funds was ascertainable. The influences of factors that align with the expectations of the original models are market premium, company size, momentum, and company profitability. The influences of factors that don't align with the expectations of the original models are investment style and company's investment conservatism. The results of investment performance attribution also pointed towards the heterogeneity of excess returns, viewed by sector. Also, the presence of momentum was observed in the realized excess returns by sectors. These findings imply that some aspects of the investment philosophy have been manifested in investment strategies that are not purely passive sector tracking based on exposure realization. Based on annual portfolio rebalancing, significant return improvements were possible when a dominant market investment style was anticipated. This is corroborated by the results based on exposure to thematic mutual funds and the annual effects of sector allocation in the sector mutual fund research. By examining the realized exposure according to the observed factors, and by analyzing the portfolio structure itself, potential inconsistencies with the stated investment strategy were identifiable. The research results analysis concluded that there is a high level of consistency at the portfolio and individual level based on the influence of factors from the used models. The use of asset-based models, which utilize data about the portfolio structure and the benchmark, enabled the acquisition of results that can be more beneficial as they can be better aligned with the investment decision-making process. The combination of factor models with asset-based models confirmed certain current market trends and provided insight into aspects that were not possible using factor models alone. The limitations of arithmetic models for investment performance attribution based on multiple periods were overcome by implementing geometric models. This led to the successful connection of multi-period returns by using geometric attribution models, without residuals. As a result, this ensures the consistency of attribution effects across different presented periods.
