This doctoral thesis primarily examines the application of contemporary financial theories in the daily operations of Serbian companies. The dissertation will introduce concepts such as capital budgeting and its methods, cost of capital, debt strategy and capital structures of Serbian businesses. The practical application of these financial theories will be explored in the empirical section of the paper, by studying a sample of 65 companies over the period 2013 to 2017. The empirical section of the thesis is divided into two parts: 1) Analysis of feedback from 65 financial executives over the period 2013 to 2017 and 2) Examination of solvency and profitability indicators of the sampled companies, sourced from pertinent documents like Balance Sheet, Income Statement, Notes to Financial Statements and Annual Business Reports over the period 2013 to 2017. Influential factors on investment and financial choices such as company size, capital source, age and tenure of financial directors etc. will also be discussed. Furthermore, the findings will be contrasted with relevant international surveys and their outcomes.
