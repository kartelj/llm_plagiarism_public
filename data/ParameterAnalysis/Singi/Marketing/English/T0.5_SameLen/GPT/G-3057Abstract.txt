Promoting cultural assets in Kosovo and Metohija to enhance tourism offerings is crucial for future recognition of the Autonomous Province of Kosovo and Metohija (AP KiM) as a significant tourist destination. Kosovo and Metohija boast a rich cultural and traditional heritage, reflecting the diverse ethnic groups residing there. Their shared existence has led to a blending of cultural influences, as well as the destruction of other cultural markers during conflicts, regardless of their cultural and historical importance to civilization. As of this dissertation's writing, it's stressed that a modern multicultural, multi-confessional, and multi-lingual society can only be fostered through active preservation of cultural diversity. The valorization of cultural and historical heritage in the former Yugoslavia territory, where Kosovo was located, was grounded in cultural values established by laws and regulations within a specific time frame. However, the economic valorization of cultural and historical heritage and goods was often overlooked. In recent decades, the cultural field has undergone changes, requiring a portion of the budget over other social sectors. Culture should also become a profit source, as cultural tourism has been identified in some countries. To preserve the rich heritage of all ethnic groups in KiM and the Republic of Serbia, it's essential to execute and innovate the valorization process of cultural values to boost tourism. The valorization of historical heritage to enhance tourism should adhere to global criteria, which dictate its protection and preservation process, and contribute to economic development and reconciliation.
