This document provides a comprehensive review of pertinent resources from both classical and modern literature in the areas of Communication, Organizational Science, Social Psychology Values, and Change Management. A critical examination of individual research shortcomings, content analysis, and comparisons of similar surveys conducted on specific respondents follows the literature review. The results of the research conducted for this dissertation, on an appropriate sample, across multiple countries, to enhance the relevance and purposefulness of the findings, are then presented. The survey involved 342 employees, with 200 completing an online survey from five regional countries and ten Western Hemisphere countries, while the remaining participants received the questionnaire through personal contact. The field research results were compared with published research, known in both domestic and foreign literature, and an analysis of similarities and differences was conducted. The document seeks to establish whether there are statistically derived indicators that demonstrate a correlation between an organization's external communication (i.e., the organization's communication with the public) and its employees' socio-personal values. A factor analysis of the sample revealed six indicators of an organization's external communication. Correlations and other statistical methods established a link between the indicators of an organization's external communication and its employees' socio-personal values, confirming the primary hypothesis of this research. Modern research, particularly domestic literature, lacks a systematic exploration of external communication as a type of organizational behavior. Specifically, there is a dearth of research examining an organization's external communication in relation to the values, desires, needs, motivation, and corporate identity of its employees. The specific nature of an organization's external communication within our social frameworks, which is often impulsive and budget-driven rather than strategically planned, warrants further investigation. It is frequently subject to a non-systematic approach dependent on a specific company department and employees primarily involved in marketing activities and press release issuance. The research also discovered a correlation between the success of an organization's external communication and employee work motivation, with a positive relationship indicating that more effective and successful external communication leads to higher employee motivation. Conversely, employee attitudes towards organizational change, which is often necessary for progress, suggest a significant difference in value priorities between those who accept and participate in change and those who resist it. These findings echo previous research, which various authors attribute to "internal motivation", meaning that employees who are less resistant to change and have a more positive attitude towards it are more self-motivated, actively participate in the change process, and often drive organizational change. These employees typically value family highly, personal happiness, are highly educated, have a strong desire for financial independence and autonomy in general, and are dedicated to their work. Therefore, given the new scientific knowledge presented in the dissertation, the discussion and final conclusions offer suggestions on how to better apply the research findings to organizational systems and their internal and external communication channels.
