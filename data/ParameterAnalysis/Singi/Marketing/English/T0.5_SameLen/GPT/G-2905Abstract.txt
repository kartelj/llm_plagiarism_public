In the contemporary era, forging connections between public and private sectors is crucial for societal advancement. This thesis investigates the evolution of the regulatory structure for public-private partnerships (PPP) and concessions in Serbia, starting from 1990. The trend of increased public participation in the private sector began in the 1970s and 1980s, primarily in developed nations and specifically in public infrastructure projects. In Serbia, concessions are not a new concept in the national economic and legal sphere. However, the public-private partnership only became part of Serbiaâ€™s legal framework in 2011, with the adoption of the Law on Public-Private Partnership and Concessions. Prior to this Law, the area was governed by the Law on Concessions at the national level, and private sector infrastructure investments at the local level were executed in line with the Public Utility Law. The ever-increasing complexity of public-private sector relationships necessitates continuous institutional engagement in formulating new rules and regulations to meet market needs. This will be the primary focus of this thesis. The objective of this study is to underscore the significance of the regulatory framework for investment development via PPP and concessions. By providing a historical overview and citing examples in the dissertation, it aims to highlight the pros and cons of regulatory frameworks that have emerged through their application, and to emphasize the importance of this topic for the future evolution of regulatory frameworks.
