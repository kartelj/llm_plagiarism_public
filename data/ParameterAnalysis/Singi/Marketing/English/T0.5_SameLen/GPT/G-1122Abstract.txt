This thesis's findings underscore the pivotal and complex role of tourist guiding in modern tourism, especially in presenting destinations and attractions to visitors. Tourist guiding functions as a guided tour chosen freely by customers, and its informal nature aids in the efficient conveyance of information, sentiments, and knowledge. A secure, high-quality tourism experience provided by a guided tour involves the tour guide, the tourists, and the environment, and is realized when all three elements interact simultaneously. Various interactions are formed between the tourists and the environment, the tourists and the guide, and among all three parties. The guide's narrative and group management significantly influence the tour participants' experience. Therefore, it can be argued that tourist guides impact not only the overall quality of a destination's tourism product but also individual tour operators and travel agencies' offerings. Their role in the tourism industry is unique for its ability to manage and coordinate tourism experiences, promote destinations, and achieve sustainable and responsible tourism objectives. The way tourist guides present and interpret influences how customers perceive a place or attraction, interact with the local culture, participate in tourist activities, and behave during their stay. As a presenter and interpreter, the tourist guide serves as a representative and "ambassador" for the destination in the eyes of tourists. The guide can influence whether tourists feel welcomed, decide to stay longer, or return. The guide can shape tourists' perceptions of a destination and sometimes even becomes the destination's brand. Without a doubt, tourist guiding is a crucial strategic factor in successfully presenting destinations in modern tourism, significantly influencing the tourism experience, the duration of stay, and the resulting economic and social advantages.
