The progress of tourism in urban areas has been a significant subject of study in recent decades. Scholars' focus on tourism is driven by the need to highlight the role of cities as tourist hotspots with a diverse range of spaces and resources. Urban tourism is an innovative method for leveraging existing resources to develop a new tourist offering, allowing cities to gain a competitive edge in the tourism industry. The unique benefits of urban tourism lie in the cities' capacity to offer suitable experiences for tourists of varying demographics and travel motivations. Moreover, compared to other tourist destinations, cities experience less seasonal fluctuation, indicating a consistent influx of tourists throughout the year. Current tourism trends show a rising preference for shorter, more frequent vacations, often in the form of city break trips. This trend enhances the appeal of cities as tourist destinations, subsequently benefiting numerous tourism providers. This doctoral thesis focuses on the evolution of urban tourism in the Republic of Serbia. To ensure a comprehensive and analytical approach, an in-depth analysis of the existing tourism offerings of Serbia's key urban tourism developers was conducted. The research presents empirical findings from both the supply and demand sides of tourism, aiming to understand the perspectives of key stakeholders, assess the current state of urban tourism, and provide recommendations for its enhancement. Tourist attitudes were examined to gauge the quality of Serbian cities' tourism offerings. The perspectives of key urban tourism promoters and relevant government institution employees were also studied to understand their views on resource importance for urban tourism development, key challenges, and strategies for improving Serbian cities' competitive standing in the tourism industry. The ultimate aim of this doctoral thesis is to answer how to enhance tourism development in Serbian cities, beyond objectively evaluating the current state of urban tourism development.
