The Serbian banking sector faced unique circumstances between 2008 and 2016, which altered the ease of managing liquidity. This study investigates the issues that management structures of domestic commercial banks had to tackle due to fluctuating markets and their responses to no/liquidity situations, and their relation to the established FTP system. The Serbian banking sector, lacking developed hedging tools, questioned the strong correlation between the FTP system and the growth of financial instruments, and the development of Asset and Liability Management (ALM) concept. The examined period also raised the issue of implementing a uniform FTP system model in banks concerning liquidity, recalling 2008 and 2016, significant liquidity, and the adoption and implications of "best practices" and new principles known as Basel III. 

A comparative analysis was performed on two commercial banks operational in the Republic of Serbia during the banking sector's liquidity crisis at the end of 2008. The primary conclusions indicate a high sensitivity of bank systemic and specific factors, the limitations of liquid financing sources, and shallow domestic markets that the crisis significantly augmented the cost of fundings and deepened maturity mismatch balance, especially in the case of Bank B. Bank A's example shows the same high sensitivity systemic risks stemming from the banking sector's insolvency, and the access to short-term funds to mitigate the liquidity crisis was not entirely effective, considering that Bank B deepened maturity mismatches four years later. 

The findings indicate that Bank A and Bank B, due to the illiquid interbank market, significant deposit outflow sources, the rise in interest rates, low levels of liquidity coefficient regulatory, resorted to a bank instrument A by issuing shares and changing the Bank's ownership structure, while Bank B through borrowings with MM short-term horizon borrowed funds at prices "higher" than the market and deferred the liquidity problem to the following year. 

The first hypothesis that commercial banks implement modern concepts of liquidity risk management is refuted after the empirical analysis of the banking sector. The main reason is that several commercial banks in this segment rely solely on regulatory requirements when it comes to liquidity risk. The second hypothesis is rejected since it was found due to that FTP system is sensitive to liquidity conditions and the banking sector's illiquidity. 

The third hypothesis is accepted, and it is through empirical analysis proves the existence of links and ALM positions in commercial banks and that its responsibilities are in direct correlation with the FTP system.
