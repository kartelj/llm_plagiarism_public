Conservation of natural ecosystems, which offer a myriad of ecosystem services to humanity, is increasingly becoming a common subject from both scientific and practical perspectives. This paper sought to identify the diversity, potential, importance, and state of all components of natural ecosystems in Libya's larger protected areas. It suggests conservation models and sustainable usage of natural ecosystems in Libya's protected areas, particularly regarding their long-term preservation and sustainable development of local communities amid Libya's complex and challenging economic and political climate. Libya's protected areas are not only significant areas of natural values but also a resource that, when used sustainably, can offer considerable ecosystem services, benefiting the local populace. The paper analyzes the following values and resources of Libya's protected areas: abiogenic factors (terrain, geological background, soil, water, climate), biogenic factors (flora, fauna, vegetation), population (composition, structure, socioeconomic characteristics, traditional lifestyle, traditional and modern activities, potential directions for sustainable development of local communities in line with natural values and traditional lifestyle, and the importance of Libya's protected areas for the state's strategic development. strategic documents, primarily a sustainable development strategy, biodiversity conservation, desertification combat, fisheries development, and other strategic documents crucial for comprehensive environmental, nature, and local population interest policies To join nations that have adopted a national sustainable development strategy, Libya needs to enable the development of a competitive market economy and balanced economic growth, human development and education, increased employment and social inclusion, infrastructure development and balanced regional development, environmental protection and rational use of natural resources. Based on a study of two respondent groups in two protected areas in Libya, it can be concluded that Libya's protected areas are a source of natural values and resources that offer ecosystem services to the local population, as most respondents from the local population group confirmed that they benefit from using resources from the protected area, primarily related to food sources for families or selling food to occasional tourists visiting both research sites. Establishing the right relationship with the values and resources of the protected areas ensures their long-term protection, enhancement, and use, as the resources from the researched protected areas are used sustainably without over-exploitation (despite their relative scarcity). The harmonized development of local communities in protected areas contributing to the state's strategic development has not been fully demonstrated, as local communities in the research areas are too small. With the development of tourism in Libya, this situation will likely improve significantly, but it first requires the development of environmental awareness in people who do not live near protected areas through education at all levels, starting from the youngest ages. A necessary condition is also the fulfillment of international obligations and the adoption of national strategies with the achievement of a higher level of ecological responsibility through the fulfillment of legislative, institutional, personnel, technical, and other assumptions, in line with international and national practice.
