Tourism, as an integral part of the global system, must establish its unique social structure, relationships, and institutions, as well as its visual (design) expression. It must consider two key factors: 1) the need to adapt and respond to the evolving demands of potential customers, influenced by changes in social development, standards, market, lifestyles, education, and information; 2) the need to be economically sustainable and environmentally conscious, considering capital owners, nature conservation, environmental preservation and cultural accomplishments. The fundamental element of the tourism sector is hospitality, which the economy equates to a profitable market economy. Hospitality generates a hotel product complex with services specifically designed, allocated, and well-equipped for mass users, considering their needs, tastes, abilities, desires. Theoretically, it is defined by location, views, grounds, facilities, equipment, services, price, brand image, and guest experience, rather than the hotel product's structure. From these examples, it can be concluded that the basic elements of the hotel product are location and services, while the main external elements are service prices and the hotel's image. The growth of global tourism, influenced by the overall development of civilization, world economy, population standards, and new consumer needs, promotes further development of hotel products towards quality, price, specialization, and standardization. This adds value for consumers as it creates new experiences such as entertainment, relaxation, rehabilitation, education, shopping, personal services, etc. The design of hotel products, as the subject of a doctoral dissertation, is presented as an artistic technological task and goal for service creators, a marketing tool for segmentation, positioning, restructuring, i.e., differentiation of the hotel product, and as a visual tool to satisfy tourist needs in the competitive market. The fundamental hypothesis of the dissertation is that successful design of hotel products significantly differentiates them and makes them market-accepted, supported by the enclosed scientific research theory and practice of tourism.
