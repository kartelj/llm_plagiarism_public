The overhaul of Serbia and Yugoslavia's primary education system from 1944 to 1959, from the conclusion of World War II to the passage of the General Education Law in 1958, which standardized an eight-year primary school system that remains in Serbia to this day, is the culmination of the "school struggle" that began in Serbian society in the late 19th century. This struggle is inextricably linked to the fight for modernization and democratization in both Serbian and Yugoslav society in the 20th century. The primary education reform in Serbia and Yugoslavia, which led to the establishment of a uniform eight-year primary school in 1958, was part of the "new school" struggle. It is worth noting that work on defining new education and upbringing policies and initiating new reforms of existing education systems began right after World War II, primarily due to the efforts of the UN organization, particularly UNESCO. The continuation of the "new" school struggle, which had been interrupted by the world wars, was greatly encouraged by the "new" recognition of childhood, which had suffered significant losses during World War II. The primary education reform from 1944 to 1959 was part of the cultural transformation struggle initiated by the revolutionary, communist government of Yugoslavia when the first government organs were established. The journey towards a better and fairer, or socialist, society was through political stabilization, which could not be achieved without economic recovery, often referred to as "overall societal progress", which also encompassed "cultural life". "Cultural life", with "educational life" as a crucial component, was thus seen as an integral part of "socialist societal transformation" from the onset. The resolutions passed at the Fifth Congress of the CPY (1948) had profound effects on the country's cultural and education and upbringing policies, as it received its main directives from the Resolution of the Third Plenary Session of the CC of the CPY adopted in December 1949. All state institutions, especially schools, were to support the new education and upbringing policy and seek assistance in the struggle for the socialist man. Schools had to depend on a complex system of mass organizations, with the Pioneer Organization being the most notable, and on "reliable" party cadre, a large number of experts in psychology, pedagogy, film, arts, literature, and music who were assembled around the Council of Societies for Child and Youth Care of Yugoslavia, and millions of parents "overlooked" in the previous century who had to play their role in building socialism, like all other citizens of the socialist community. In this way, the "new" education policy helped foster the concept of school as the starting point for societal modernization or cultural revolution and the construction of socialism.
