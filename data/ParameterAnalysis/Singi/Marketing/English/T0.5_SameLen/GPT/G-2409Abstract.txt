The process of decision making invariably includes a risk element among other factors. Insurance firms base their operations on the concept of risk. These companies have developed numerous actuarial techniques and models to balance income and expenditure, meet profit targets, and maintain solvency simultaneously. The business transactions of insurance companies are a vital aspect of every national economy. Aiming to minimize risks and ensure the security and stability of financial flows, a country establishes rules and procedures to define the legal framework of their business activities. Insurance companies set up various reserves to keep solvency. Technical reserves are used to cover future insurance contract liabilities. These reserves are the basis for balancing anticipated risks (damages, insured amounts, and compensations). Insurance companies collect additional capital funds (guarantee reserves) to cover unexpected risks - catastrophic events and unforeseen business losses. As institutional investors, insurance companies invest reserve funds in the financial market. The primary market risk management during the investment process involves aligning assets and liabilities as a basis for maintaining long-term solvency. The business operations of insurance companies are also affected by many other risks - strategic, operational, credit, legal, etc. Identifying, categorizing, and monitoring risks require extensive knowledge of methodology and the specifics of risk management in insurance companies. Research findings indicate that applying risk management in practice is key to improving business performance.
