This doctoral dissertation is driven by a perceived lack of adequate application and understanding of psychology in consumer marketing management. The research focuses on the process of new product development, an area fraught with complexity and financial risk, necessitating a thorough understanding of marketing management. The study examines the role of psychology in the creation of new products, using the examples of instant coffee products, Grand Instant and Doncafe Instant, in the Serbian market from 2007 to 2015. Both primary and secondary data were used, with primary data gathered through quantitative methodology from a sample of 800 respondents aged 18 to 30. This data was used to analyze customer attitudes and satisfaction. Qualitative methodology was also used, with specific questions quantified through interviews with company managers. Secondary data on brand performance was obtained from longitudinal studies conducted by three market research agencies. The dissertation investigates how psychology was utilized in new product development. The main hypothesis, that inadequate attention to consumers and psychological processes in product development affects product success and consumer satisfaction, was confirmed. Marketing managers often oversimplify the complex process of new product development. The study found that consumers feel overlooked in the product development process, leading to dissatisfaction and non-use of the product. The importance of initiating product development based on consumer needs is highlighted, emphasizing the crucial role of psychology in marketing. The dissertation concludes that Serbian companies often neglect psychology in new product development, and face other challenges such as lack of marketing concept acceptance, formal document production, and strategic planning. A revised model for new product development is proposed to address these issues.
