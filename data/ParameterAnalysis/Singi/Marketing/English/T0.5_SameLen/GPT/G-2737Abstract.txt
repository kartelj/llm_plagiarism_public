Serbia boasts a rich assortment of tourist attractions, steeped in history and boasting well-preserved resources. However, the country's tourism products have not been effectively developed or marketed to the international community. To enhance their standing, there is a need to boost competitiveness, a process that necessitates substantial financial resources. Like many developing nations, Serbia views foreign investment as a means to grow this sector, modernize the tourism offerings, increase exports, create jobs, and generate income, as well as prevent migration from underdeveloped regions where tourism, due to the well-preserved resources, may be the only development opportunity. This dissertation conducts a thorough analysis of the factors important for attracting foreign investments in Serbian tourism, followed by a benchmark analysis of selected competitive countries to understand how they increased foreign investment in tourism and the outcomes achieved in this sector, as well as to comprehend Serbia's competitive standing in relation to these nations. The research, conducted via questionnaires, reveals the extent to which the attractiveness factors for foreign investment in Serbian tourism are met and identifies the critical areas that need immediate improvement. The questionnaire-based research also assesses the attractiveness of Serbian tourism to foreign investors and identifies other critical areas that need priority attention. The final research will focus on the competitive environment of the local tourist destination using the adapted Porterâ€™s Five Forces model, pinpointing opportunities to bolster the destination's position in relation to the five forces, identify its strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats, and determine the strategy for attracting foreign investment to enhance its competitiveness. The aim of this dissertation is to aid in answering the question of how to attract foreign investment in Serbian tourism, or what actions should be taken to enhance the existing environment to increase the competitiveness of this sector.
