The Phd thesis theme explores the understanding and interpretation of ethics and comprehensive marketing communications via the application of ethics in various marketing areas, beginning with advertising, market research, modeling marketing, and promotional mix to communication with the targeted group, specifically focusing on children and youth. The findings from communication methods and techniques show the potential impact of brand products on purchasing behavior, media selection and following by young people, attitudes towards advertising, and the exploration of consumerist and materialistic attitudes in children, particularly when influenced by advertising. The development of a unique communication strategy by a company operating in the children's products and services market differs from a company that employs a general communication strategy. The implementation of the integrated marketing communication model for young people requires adherence to ethical principles, rules, and codes when conducting all marketing activities targeting children. The central hypothesis begins with the belief that through integrated marketing communications, mass communication is abandoned, and the company surpasses targeted contact access to both existing and potential customers ethically. Thanks to secondary hypotheses, the research demonstrates the impact of advertising on young people; the measuring effects of brand products and services on children's purchases; the emergence of conflicts between parent and child as a result of frequent exposure to advertising; the contrast between the world in advertising and reality, and the potential growth of materialistic values in children as a result of advertising stimuli. The findings indicate that junior scholars (lower primary school classes) compared to senior scholars (upper primary school classes) have a more positive attitude towards advertising and a preference for branded products and services. It is conclusively established that frequent exposure to advertisements prompts young people to demand purchases, thereby increasing conflicts between parents and children. Generally, children do not believe that the world depicted in advertisements matches reality. It has been verified that children's materialistic values increase due to advertising stimuli.
