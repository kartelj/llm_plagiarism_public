This thesis aims to explore the potential of applying the ARIMA model for forecasting crude oil prices, and subsequently managing market risk in oil companies using the VaR method. This is with a view to implement these in the intricate system of managing firms in the crude oil production, processing, and distribution sector. The objective of any company's management, including oil companies, is to maximize profits, achieve its planned rate, or continuously generate profit regardless of time and business conditions. Ensuring market risk remains within acceptable boundaries is a vital task that requires management to promptly implement corrective measures and minimize risks while optimizing funding sources, taking into account amounts, deadlines, and prices. The results obtained corroborate the assertion that oil companies should employ suitable models for predicting oil price movements and managing risks when transacting with crude oil, to keep market risk within acceptable parameters. This forms a solid foundation for making future business decisions in volatile times. Future research will encompass the application of other existing and new models and methods, and their combination, and testing of extreme events for predicting crude oil prices and managing market risks in the business operations of companies in the crude oil production, processing, and distribution sector. Future research will also consider country risk and energy security as prerequisites for the functioning of the economy and all its stakeholders, as well as potential users of this finite resource, to ensure a steady supply and maintenance of mandatory crude oil reserves at a required level.
