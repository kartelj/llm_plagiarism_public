Modern nations endorse tourism development as a key export industry, viewing it as a revenue source and a means to increase job opportunities. Amidst global competition and numerous worldwide destinations, these countries must invest significant funds to establish conditions for growth and to enhance their competitive edge. Considering Serbia's challenging competitive standing globally, minimal investment, the effects of the global economic crisis on foreign direct investment, and a deficiency in project investment, the Serbian Government identifies its growth potential in implementing specific public-private partnership forms and creating an environment for their execution, drawing from successful international models. Investment forms and methods are dictated by investors' investment strategies and the options permitted by domestic regulations. The intricate and mutually significant relationship between the private partner and national enterprise is amplified in public-private partnership projects. This relationship acquires notable social and political dimensions, particularly regarding national infrastructure investments. Consequently, due to limited finances, Serbia perceives public-private partnership projects as another avenue for rejuvenating existing businesses, enhancing their operations, activating new capabilities, and generating new employment opportunities. This thesis aims to highlight the opportunities that public-private partnerships offer through long-term organizational models and procedures to boost Serbian tourism's competitiveness and alleviate public finance burdens.
