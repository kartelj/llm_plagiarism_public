The tourism and hospitality sectors increasingly contribute to the economies of many countries, with infrastructure investments significantly aiding overall growth. This infrastructure and the variety of tourism products and services help slow and halt the deterioration and decline of rural regions. Digital transformation, characterized by interactivity and personalization, is an inevitable part of globalization and the hypermobility of the job market. In this context, tourism and hospitality businesses promote job openings, tailoring their efforts to specific audiences based on extensive digital data on potential candidates. Non-linear communication methods and the sharing of promotional content allow individuals to access a wealth of advertising material based on their interests and abilities. Research for a doctoral thesis confirmed that media should not be seen merely as passive conveyors of one-way messages; their interactivity allows for feedback from a dynamic job market. Data on the use of social media during recruitment processes underscored their indispensability as key communication platforms. As they navigate between the long-term development functions driven by convergent media communications and short-term economic interests, tourism and hospitality businesses require a carefully planned and executed strategy to attract suitable candidates with the necessary knowledge, experience, and skills.
