The worldwide crisis directly affected all transitioning nations, including ours, leading to reduced investments, foreign investor withdrawal, and increasing debts. Despite the rise in non-performing loans, Bosnia and Herzegovina's banking sector managed to withstand the economic crisis's more severe effects, in part due to its conservative approach, negating the need for risk-taking as current business operations remain profitable. Furthermore, a study has been conducted on the stock exchange's operations in Bosnia and Herzegovina during the observed period, examining the phases from inception, growth, and eventually, turnover decline, which isn't solely due to the economic crisis but also a mix of internal factors. The banking sector, which is primarily privatised with foreign private capital dominating, is crucial to the overall financial system, where deposits are the primary business operation source, and loans are the essential product. Given that loans are commonly used for fund placement and play a significant role in overall banking operations, credit risk poses a cash flow issue and a liquidity problem for banks, which is partially the thesis's focus. To maintain a quality loan portfolio, bank management implements a clear loan policy that optimises profitability within the bank's acceptable risk parameters. The thesis investigates the dynamics of non-performing loans in Republika Srpska, based on the Banking Agency of Republika Srpska's reports from 2009 â€“ 2016. The study's goals included testing econometric theory, providing empirical results, and forecasting future values. Given the nature, evolution, and current economic conditions in Bosnia and Herzegovina (undeveloped capital markets, inadequate collateral realisation and collection regulations, and credit operations' dominance in overall banking operations), the most attention in controlling banking operations is given to credit risk, liquidity risk, and foreign exchange risk control. Due to the absence of a market for most asset items, sophisticated market evaluations are not yet feasible. Foreign investors' interest in the region's banking market began in the early 2000s. Factors that attracted foreign investors to the region's banking sector included developed financial and credit markets, gross domestic product level, low inflation rate, economic growth, and productivity. The primary motivation for foreign investors' arrival was the potential for returns, leading them to enter these markets, achieving dominance and increased competitiveness. German, Austrian, Italian, and French banks demonstrated the most interest in these markets. The entry of foreign banks into the region's banking sector brought expected benefits like new technology and innovation introduction, enhanced competitiveness and infrastructure, and the arrival of foreign investors. Banks with predominantly foreign capital performed better than local banks due to better service provision.
