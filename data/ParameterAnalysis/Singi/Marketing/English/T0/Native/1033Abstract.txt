Countries of modern world support the development of tourism as an important export industry and see in it a source of income and possibility for higher employment. In global competition, among large number of destinations in the world, the countries need to allocate substantial financial resources in order to create conditions for the development and to develop their comparative advantage in competitive. Given the unfavorable competitive position of Serbia in the world, a low grade of investment, the impact of global economic crisis on foreign direct investment, as well as lack of investments in projects, the Government of the Republic of Serbia sees its development opportunity in the application of specific forms of public-private partnership and creation of environment for their implementation, following the examples of good international practice. Forms and methods of investment are conditioned by investment strategy of investors, on the one hand, and the options allowed by national regulations, on the other hand. Mutually important and complex relationship between the private partner and national enterprise is multiplied in projects of public-private partnership. Together with economic and legal, it gains significant social and political dimensions, especially when it comes to investments in national infrastructure. Therefore, due to limited financial resources Serbia sees in projects of public-private partnership another opportunity for revitalization of existing enterprises, improvement of their activity and activation of new capacities and creation of new jobs. The aim of the thesis is to indicate the opportunities provided by public-private partnership through long-term organizational models and procedures in function of raising competitive position of Serbian tourism and exonerating public finances.
