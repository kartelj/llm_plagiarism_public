The aim of this paper is to estimate the effects of different balance sheet and off- balans sheet determinants on the interest rate risk exposure of banks operating in developed and emerging financial markets. The quantification of the analysed exposure contributes to the process of identifying, monitoring and managing interest rate risk. As a sample of a developed financial market we surveyed 65 bank holding companies in the United States, whereas the sample of a emerging financial market included 10 banks from the Republic of Serbia, which are listed on the Belgrade Stock Exchange. A comparative analysis of the influence of the balance sheet characteristics was conducted on the basis of the results of Stoneâ€Ÿs regression model and the econometric panel model. The results of the application of these models support the contention that factors such as the size of banks and the share of deposits in total assets generate a statistically significant but opposite effect on the banks from the developed and emerging financial markets. The growth in total assets of banks in the United States increases its exposure to interest rate risk, while in Serbia the effect is opposite. Similarly, an increase in the share of deposits in total assets of the U.S. banks reduces exposure to interest rate risk, while banks in the Republic of Serbia experience a different effect. There are statistically significant factors whose effects are similar, for example. An increase in return on average equity (ROAE) and a decrease in net interest income have an impact on the reduction of the exposure of banks to interest rate risk, regardless of the development of the market where banks operate.
