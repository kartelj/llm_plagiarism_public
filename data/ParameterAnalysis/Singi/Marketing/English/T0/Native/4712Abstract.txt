The dissertation covers a part of relatively unexplored subject of the influence of  printing and packaging process on the characteristics of printed flexible packaging materials,  as well as the determination of their values by applying appropriate multicriteria evaluation  methods. Based on the experimental analysis of flexible packaging materials, their  magnitudes of changes have ben evaluated and compared. In the research and evaluation  limitations have been set that primarily relate to the selected types of packaging materials and  the type of packaged contents. The result of this evaluation is a transparent sum of the values  of individual variants of printed flexible packaging materials, where for each material the  fulfilment of the requirements for individual food products can be calculated.
