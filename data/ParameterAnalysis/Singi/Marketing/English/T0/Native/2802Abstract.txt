The doctoral thesis deals with the role that sustainability plays in the modern practice of   destination governance in the alpine and dinaric mountain destinations. In that sense, a   comparison is first made regarding the implementation of sustainability in the process of   destination governance by destination management organizations (DMO) in the Alps and   in the Dinarides. Through a questionnaire, quantitative data was collected that was used   to  analyze  the  differences  in  the  two  regions  regarding  the  implementation  of   sustainability principles in planning the destination, leadership/management styles in the   destination governance/management, destination  development  priorities, as well as the   importance given to the different types of stakeholders. After that, a comparison is made   regarding  the  two  most  developed  mountain  destinations  in  the  Republic  of  Serbia, Kopaonik  and  Zlatibor,  using  the  integrated  framework  for  indicators  of  sustainable   tourism.  This  way,  shortcomings  where  identified,  and  suggestions  were  given  for   improvements  in  both  destinations. Finally, using  an interview methodology,  a deeper   research is made into the ways and  available means for implementation of sustainable   tourism in the German Alps, as an example of an alpine region whose experiences can be   used  in  the  development  of  the  mountain  tourism  in  the  region  of  the  Dinarides.  We   discussed the following issues with the interviewees: strengths, weaknesses, opportunities   and threats in the destination; sustainability as well as projects initiatives and plans related   to  sustainability;  the  most  important  stakeholders  of  sustainable  tourism,  natural   resources and their protection; indicators of sustainable development; and cross-border   cooperation, while the subject of ecotourism spontaneously emerged as an important issue   during the interviews.
