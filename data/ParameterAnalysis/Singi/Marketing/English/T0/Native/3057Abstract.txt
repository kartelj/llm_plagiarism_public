Valorization of culture valuables on Kosovo and Metohija with function of strengthening touristic offerings is an important question for future acknowledgment of Autonomus province of Kosovo and Metohija (AP KiM) as a valuable touristic destination. Kosovo and Metohija is a place that has very rich culture and tradition and cultural heritage of all ethnic groups that live there. Their mutual coexistence brought permeation of cultural influences, as well as destruction of marks of other cultures during conflicts, regardless their cultural and historical value for civilization. For the time of writing this dissertation, it is emphasized that modern multicultural, multi- confessional and multi-lingual society can only be built by active preservation of cultural diversity. Valorization of cultural and historical heritage on teritorry of former Yugoslavia, in which Kosovo was situated, was based on cultural values determined by laws and regulations in determined time cap. Economic valorization of cultural and historical heritage and goods was often missing. In the last few decades, the situation has changed in the field of culture, which has to get a part of the budget over other social fields. Culture should also become a source of profit itself, like culture tourism is already identified as such in certain countries. For the sake of saving rich heritage of all ethnic groups on territory of KiM, as well as in Republic of Serbia, it is necessary to realize and innovated process of valorization of culture values in order to strengthen tourism. Valorization of historic heritage in function of strengthening tourism should be based upon global criteria, which define process of its protection and preservation, and contribute to the economic development and conciliation.
