Under modern conditions, linking public and private sector has become an imperative for social development. The research topic of this thesis is the development of the regulatory framework of the public-private partnership (PPP) and concessions in Serbia, in the period from 1990. The expansion of the public involvement in the private sector occured in the 1970s and 1980s in the public infrastructure projects, and primarily in the the most developed countries. In Serbia, the concessions do not represent a novelty in the national economic and legal practice. However, the public-private partnership entered Serbiaâ€™s legal system only in 2011 when the Law on Public-Private Partnership and Concessions was adopted. Until adoption of this Law, this area was regulated by the Law on Concessions at the national level, while at the local level the private sector investments in infrastructure have been carried out in accordance with the Public Utility Law. More and more complex relationship between public and private sector requires continious involvement of the institutions through adopting new rules and regulations in order to satisfy the demands of the market. Precisely this will be the main argument of this thesis. This study aims to highlight the importance of the regulatory framework for the development of investments through PPP and concessions. Through historical overview and the examples given in the dissertation, the goal is to point out the advantages and disadvantages of regulatory frameworks that have become visible through their implementation, and to draw attention to the importance of this issue in the future development of the regulatory frameworks.
