The problem of business improvement from the point of view of process optimization and cost reduction is a standard goal of every business system. Newer improvements were based on the application of the latest technologies, but they primarily dealt with a partial segment of the business, such as equipment maintenance with work orders and analysis of the results of troubleshooting. They did not take into account the complete process, from the notification of the defect to the moment of elimination of the defects. That is why the proposed solutions were partial and, in some cases, gave completely wrong analysis results. The proposed solution is based on defining the way to include the complete process, choosing the most optimal standard for recording, analyzing and optimizing the process and choosing the appropriate data format that can be reconciled with the analyzed process and the defined objects recorded during the process. Therefore, the solution was based on the application of the appropriate standard for that type of process, which was achieved by applying multiple criteria analysis and analysis of the available professional literature, then on the application of a data warehouse as a general data structure, and with additional analyzes object process data warehouse was adopted, with target analysis parameters and defined limit values. The key results obtained from the analysis showed that the application of the chosen standard for process recording provided a key base of elements needed for optimization, that the application of the object process data warehouse provided a high-quality and realistic database. By transforming data from a relational to a data warehouse structure, a simple structure was obtained that provided dynamic access to data and its dynamic grouping and specialization, and additional extensions related to threshold and target values fully justified the applied concept. With this concept, it was shown that from the original starting point that the maintenance system is very successful (equipment uptime at the level of >95%) when only the work order is observed, there were indications that in over 30% of interventions, when looking at the complete process, there is delays in troubleshooting.
