The overhaul of Serbia and Yugoslavia's primary education system from 1944 to 1959, from the conclusion of World War II to the enactment of the General Law on Education in 1958, resulted in a standardized eight-year primary school system that still exists in Serbia today. This reform was a continuation of the "struggle for school" that began in Serbian society in the late 19th century and was intertwined with the fight for modernization and democratization in both Serbian and Yugoslavian societies in the 20th century. 

The establishment of the uniform eight-grade primary school in 1958 was part of the struggle for a "new school". The push for new education and upbringing policies and reforms began immediately after World War II, largely due to the efforts of the United Nations organization, specifically UNESCO. The continuation of the struggle for a "new" school, which had been interrupted by the world wars, was particularly spurred by the rediscovery of childhood, which had suffered significant losses during World War II. 

The reform of the primary education system from 1944 to 1959 was part of the struggle for societal cultural transformation, which the revolutionary communist government of Yugoslavia initiated when the first government organs were established. The journey towards a better, fairer, socialist society required political stabilization, which could not be achieved without economic recovery or the "overall progress of society", including "cultural life". 

"Cultural life", including "educational life", was seen as an integral part of the "socialist transformation of society" from the outset. The decisions made at the Fifth Congress of the CPY (1948) had significant impacts on the country's cultural and education policies, which were guided by the Resolution of the Third Plenary Session of the CC of the CPY, adopted in December 1949. All state institutions, especially schools, were expected to support the new education policy and contribute to the struggle for the man of socialism. 

Schools were to rely on a complex system of mass organizations, with the Pioneer Organization being the most notable, and on "reliable" party cadre, a large number of experts in psychology, pedagogy, film, arts, literature, and music who were associated with the Council of Societies for Child and Youth Care of Yugoslavia, and millions of parents who had been "neglected" in the previous century but were expected to contribute to the building of socialism. In this way, the "new" education policy helped to establish the idea of school as the starting point for societal modernization or cultural revolution and the construction of socialism.
