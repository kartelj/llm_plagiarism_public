The competitiveness of tourist destinations, a topic of significant interest to both the scientific community and the destinations themselves, is influenced by current market trends. To stand out from the competition, these destinations must provide high-quality experiences. By doing so, they become more appealing and secure a stronger competitive stance. Destination management plays a crucial role in efficiently and effectively utilizing all available resources, adhering to sustainability principles, and formulating clear, effective strategies for product development to enhance the tourist experience. 

To improve their competitive position, it's vital for tourist destinations to consistently assess their competitiveness using various evaluation techniques. These techniques can measure past, present, or future competitiveness. This measurement process forms the foundation for product development in modern tourism. The results obtained from these measurements help determine a destination's standing compared to its competitors. These results also guide the development process and help address any weaknesses in the current competitive position. 

As a first step in determining a tourist destination's competitiveness, competitiveness indicators are evaluated to create a framework and guidelines for future tourism development and competitive positioning. This research suggests that ongoing competitiveness measurement is a crucial component of the tourist destination management process. 

This study focuses on the competitiveness of tourist destinations and the indicators used to measure competitiveness, with a particular emphasis on Serbia as a tourist destination. It lays the groundwork for a model that could be used for ongoing competitiveness measurement of Serbian tourism in the future. The adapted integrated model of destination competitiveness proposed here is used to measure Serbia's competitiveness as a tourist destination. The conclusions highlight the factors and indicators of competitiveness that Serbia should prioritize in its future development. The results reveal the strengths and weaknesses of Serbia's competitive position as a tourist destination.
