This study aims to evaluate the impact of various balance sheet and off-balance sheet factors on the interest rate risk exposure of banks in both developed and emerging financial markets. The quantification of this exposure aids in the identification, monitoring, and management of interest rate risk. We examined 65 bank holding companies in the United States as a representative sample of a developed financial market, and 10 banks from the Republic of Serbia, listed on the Belgrade Stock Exchange, as a representative sample of an emerging financial market. A comparative analysis of the influence of balance sheet characteristics was carried out using Stone's regression model and the econometric panel model. The findings from these models suggest that factors such as bank size and the proportion of deposits in total assets have a statistically significant but contrasting effect on banks in developed and emerging financial markets. For instance, an increase in total assets of U.S. banks heightens their exposure to interest rate risk, while the opposite is true for Serbian banks. Similarly, a rise in the proportion of deposits in total assets reduces U.S. banks' exposure to interest rate risk, but has a different effect on Serbian banks. However, certain factors, such as an increase in return on average equity (ROAE) and a decrease in net interest income, similarly affect banks' exposure to interest rate risk, irrespective of the market's level of development.
