Over the past several decades, the cruise tourism industry, a subset of nautical tourism, has seen rapid growth. A global analysis of cruise destinations reveals that this form of tourism is thriving worldwide. While it undoubtedly fosters unity, mutual understanding, and financial benefits, cruise tourism also has its drawbacks. Therefore, strategic management of this sector, particularly in line with sustainable development principles, is crucial. This study focuses on the current state of cruise tourism in the municipality of Kotor, exploring its potential, pros and cons, strategic growth, and its standing in the global cruise tourism market. The author highlights how cruise tourism enhances the town's offerings and its positive economic impact. A survey was conducted to gauge the views of Kotor's economic sector and residents on the role and significance of cruise tourism. The findings suggest that cruise tourism is seen as a key component of Kotor's tourism industry, with the potential to elevate Montenegro to a globally renowned tourist destination. However, the respondents felt that cruise tourism is underdeveloped and needs further promotion. The primary benefits identified were economic growth for local communities and job creation. The main socio-cultural benefits include exposure to new cultures and showcasing local traditions. The most significant negative impact is the degradation of natural resources. The respondents felt that the government should take the lead in maximizing the benefits and minimizing the drawbacks of cruise tourism, including implementing stronger legislative measures. Emphasizing education about the importance of cruise tourism and enhancing dialogue among key stakeholders to address local community needs were also deemed crucial.
