Modern nations recognize the significance of tourism as a key export industry, viewing it as a source of income and a means to increase employment. Amidst global competition and a multitude of worldwide destinations, these countries must invest substantial financial resources to foster development and establish their competitive edge. Serbia, however, finds itself in a disadvantageous competitive position globally due to low investment levels, the impact of the global economic crisis on foreign direct investment, and a lack of investment in projects. As a result, the Serbian government sees potential for growth in the implementation of specific public-private partnership models, creating an environment conducive to their execution, following successful international examples. The forms and methods of investment are dictated by the investment strategies of investors and the options permitted by national regulations. The intricate and mutually beneficial relationship between the private partner and national enterprise is amplified in public-private partnership projects. This relationship takes on significant social and political dimensions, particularly in relation to investments in national infrastructure. Consequently, Serbia views public-private partnership projects as another opportunity to revitalize existing businesses, enhance their operations, activate new capacities, and create new jobs due to limited financial resources. The objective of this thesis is to highlight the opportunities offered by public-private partnerships through long-term organizational models and procedures to enhance the competitive position of Serbian tourism and alleviate public finances.
