Wine is a key product of Montenegro's agriculture, characterized by its relatively low domestic consumption and substantial contribution to the country's exports. The prominence of wine in the country, along with the unique characteristics of its grapes and wine in certain regions, underscores its importance in the overall agricultural production and to a significant portion of the population.

This study aims to investigate and scientifically validate methods for enhancing the marketing of this product in the domestic market. To achieve this, considerable efforts are required to improve quality, promote sales channels, and undertake various other activities. Additionally, considering the current state of wine exports and their regional destinations, as well as the shortcomings in foreign market promotion, numerous measures are proposed to sustain and boost export levels, and by expanding the market, increase sales of high-quality wines. In this regard, we highlight the exploration of export opportunities to promising markets such as the USA, Canada, Japan, and China.

Wine production, as a traditional agricultural sector, is expected to contribute to the development of agriculture and the country's economy. Therefore, it is crucial to enhance all marketing activities that were previously overlooked in wine production and sales.
