The doctoral dissertation explores the significance of sustainability in contemporary destination governance, focusing on alpine and dinaric mountain destinations. Initially, a comparative analysis is conducted on the application of sustainability in destination governance by Destination Management Organizations (DMO) in the Alps and the Dinarides. Quantitative data, gathered through a survey, is utilized to examine the disparities between the two regions in terms of sustainability principles' application in destination planning, leadership/management styles in destination governance/management, destination development priorities, and the value attributed to various stakeholders. Subsequently, a comparison is drawn between Kopaonik and Zlatibor, the two most developed mountain destinations in Serbia, using the integrated framework for sustainable tourism indicators. This process identifies areas of improvement for both destinations. Lastly, an interview-based research delves deeper into the methods and resources available for implementing sustainable tourism in the German Alps, an alpine region whose experiences could be beneficial for the development of mountain tourism in the Dinarides region. The interviews covered topics such as strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats in the destination; sustainability and related project initiatives and plans; key stakeholders of sustainable tourism, natural resources and their conservation; indicators of sustainable development; and cross-border cooperation. The topic of ecotourism also emerged as a significant issue during the interviews.
