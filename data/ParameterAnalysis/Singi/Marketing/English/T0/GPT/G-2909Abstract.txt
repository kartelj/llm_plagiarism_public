The influence of foreign direct investment (FDI) on the current account is multifaceted, with potential positive or negative effects based on the total investment amount and its sectoral allocation. The thesis presented a theoretical and empirical examination of FDI's impact on Serbia's trade balance and income account, particularly focusing on its effect on the Serbian manufacturing industry. Additionally, the thesis explored the influence of FDI on technology transfer in Serbia, its capacity to facilitate access to international markets, its effect on the structure and specialization of exports and imports, and its role in the appreciation of the exchange rate. The dissertation also discussed the reasons behind the current account deficit in Central and Eastern European countries and investigated the role of FDI in maintaining the current account deficit. This is because FDI is a crucial financing source for the current account deficit and can potentially trigger financial contagion through various channels.
