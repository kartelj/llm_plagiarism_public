This doctoral thesis primarily examines the application of contemporary financial theories in the daily operations of Serbian companies. The thesis will introduce concepts such as capital budgeting and its methods, cost of capital, debt strategy, and the capital structures of Serbian companies. The practical application of these financial theories will be explored in the empirical section of the paper, which will analyze a sample of 65 companies from 2013 to 2017. This empirical section is divided into two parts: 1) A review of the responses from 65 financial executives from 2013 to 2017, and 2) An examination of the solvency and profitability indicators of the sample companies, derived from key documents like Balance Sheets, Income Statements, Notes to the Financial Statements, and Annual Business Reports from 2013 to 2017. The thesis will also discuss factors that impact investment and financial decisions, such as company size, capital source, and the age and tenure of financial directors. The findings will be juxtaposed with relevant international survey results for comparison.
