The significance of maintaining natural ecosystems, which offer a range of ecosystem services to humanity, is becoming a prevalent subject from both a scientific and practical perspective. This paper aims to identify the diversity, potential, importance, and state of all elements of natural ecosystems in Libya's larger protected areas. It suggests conservation models and sustainable usage of natural ecosystems in Libya's protected areas, particularly considering their long-term preservation and the sustainable development of local communities amidst Libya's challenging economic and political climate. 

Libya's protected areas are not only valuable natural regions but also resources that can offer significant ecosystem services, benefiting the local population, if used sustainably. The paper analyzes the following values and resources of Libya's protected areas: abiogenic factors (relief, geological background, soil, water, climate), biogenic factors (flora, fauna, vegetation), and population (composition, structure, socioeconomic characteristics, traditional lifestyle, traditional and contemporary activities, potential sustainable development directions for local communities in line with natural values and traditional lifestyle). It also discusses the importance of these areas for Libya's strategic development, including sustainable development strategies, biodiversity conservation, desertification combat, fisheries development, and other strategic documents crucial for the local population's environmental, nature, and interest policies.

For Libya to join nations that have adopted national sustainable development strategies, it must develop a competitive market economy and balanced economic growth, educate its people, increase employment and social inclusion, develop infrastructure and balanced regional development, and protect and improve the environment while using natural resources rationally. 

Based on a study of two respondent groups in two of Libya's protected areas, it's clear that these areas are a source of natural values and resources that offer ecosystem services to the local population. Most respondents confirmed that they benefit from using resources from the protected areas, primarily for family food sources or selling food to occasional tourists. By establishing a proper relationship with the values and resources of the protected areas, their long-term protection, improvement, and use are ensured. The resources from the protected areas are used sustainably, and there is no over-exploitation. 

The harmonized development of local communities in protected areas contributing to the state's strategic development hasn't been fully proven due to the small size of the local communities in the research areas. However, with the development of tourism in Libya, this situation could improve significantly. It's necessary to develop environmental protection awareness in people who don't live near protected areas through education at all levels. Implementing international obligations and adopting national strategies with a higher level of ecological responsibility is also crucial, in line with international and national practice.
