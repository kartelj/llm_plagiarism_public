The dissertation titled "Problems of Assessing Value of Small and Medium Enterprises in Different Life Cycle Stages" made a significant contribution to the methodological understanding of two unexplored business economy phenomena. The research's subject, goal, problem, hypothesis, methodology, and expected contribution were outlined in the introduction. 

The first part of the work, "Theoretical Framework: Overview of Current Researches in the Field of Interactions of Development Stages and Assessing Value of Small and Medium Enterprises," highlighted the importance of small and medium enterprises for economic development, particularly in transitional and post-transitional countries. The need to examine the influence of different development stages on enterprise value was emphasized. 

The methodological framework included a systematization of methodical concepts and methodologies for assessing the value of small and medium enterprises and diagnosing their development stage. The methods used included assessing the book value, yielding value, and liquidation value. The methodology was divided into three phases: preparation, implementation, and closing. 

The second part of the paper, "Methodological Framework: Overview of Current Methodology in the Field of Interaction of Development and Value Assessing of Small and Medium Enterprises," discussed the choice of methodological framework. The St.Gallen methodology was applied, providing an overview of four standard ideal models of development. 

A sample of 55 small and medium enterprises was examined, with 15 excluded due to an inability to determine their phase. The remaining 40 were placed in four ideal standard phases, with each phase consisting of 10 enterprises. The book, yielding, and liquidation values were assessed for each enterprise. 

The third part of the work, "Applicative Framework: Overview of Current Research in the Field of Interaction of Development Phases and Assessing Value of Small and Medium Enterprises," tested the central hypothesis and four auxiliary hypotheses. The interaction of development phases and the selection of the proposed methodology were discussed. 

The conclusion presented a synthesis of the research, the most important findings, and recommendations for future research.
