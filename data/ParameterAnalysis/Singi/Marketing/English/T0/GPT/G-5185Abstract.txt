The objective of enhancing business operations through process optimization and cost reduction is a common aim for all business systems. Recent advancements have largely relied on the latest technologies, focusing primarily on specific business segments such as equipment maintenance through work orders and troubleshooting result analysis. However, these improvements often overlooked the entire process, from defect notification to defect elimination. Consequently, the proposed solutions were often incomplete and sometimes led to entirely incorrect analysis results. 

The suggested solution involves defining a method to encompass the entire process, selecting the most optimal standard for recording, analyzing, and optimizing the process, and choosing a suitable data format that can be reconciled with the analyzed process and the defined objects recorded during the process. The solution was therefore based on the application of the appropriate standard for that type of process, achieved through multi-criteria analysis and review of relevant professional literature. It also involved the use of a data warehouse as a general data structure, with additional analyses adopting an object process data warehouse, with target analysis parameters and defined limit values. 

The primary results from the analysis indicated that the chosen standard for process recording provided a crucial foundation for optimization, and the object process data warehouse offered a high-quality and realistic database. The transformation of data from a relational structure to a data warehouse structure resulted in a simplified structure that allowed dynamic data access, grouping, and specialization. Additional extensions related to threshold and target values fully validated the applied concept. 

This concept demonstrated that, while the maintenance system appeared highly successful (with equipment uptime >95%) when only considering the work order, over 30% of interventions showed delays in troubleshooting when the entire process was taken into account.
