This doctoral thesis is motivated by the observed lack of sufficient application and understanding of psychology in marketing management, particularly in the context of new product development. This process is complex and financially risky, necessitating a thorough understanding and analysis of marketing management. The thesis examines the use of psychology in new product development, using the case study of instant coffee products, Grand Instant and Doncafe Instant, in the Serbian market from 2007 to 2015. 

Data for the study was collected from primary and secondary sources. Primary data was gathered through a quantitative survey of 800 respondents aged 18 to 30, and qualitative interviews with managers from Grand and Doncafe. Secondary data on brand performance was obtained from longitudinal studies conducted by three regional market research agencies. 

The thesis investigates whether psychology was effectively utilized in new product development. The main hypothesis, that inadequate attention to consumers and psychological processes in new product development affects product success and consumer satisfaction, was confirmed. It was found that consumers were often treated as a homogeneous group expected to react to a product based on trends in neighboring countries. 

The study also confirmed the assumption that marketing managers recognize the importance of psychology in new product development, but often apply it superficially. This is not solely due to time constraints, but other factors as well. Another confirmed assumption was that consumers feel underrepresented in the process, leading to dissatisfaction and non-use of the product. 

The thesis concludes that businesses in Serbia, in addition to insufficient application of psychology in new product development, also face challenges related to the process itself, such as lack of acceptance of marketing concepts, formal documentation, strategic planning, and consumer research. A revised model for new product development is proposed to address these issues, emphasizing the need for consumer research, strategic planning, and adherence to modern marketing concepts.
