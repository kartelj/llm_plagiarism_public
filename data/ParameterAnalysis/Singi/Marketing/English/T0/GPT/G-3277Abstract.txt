Tourism, as a component of the global system, must construct its own unique social structure, relationships, institutions, and visual expressions. This is done by considering two key factors: 1) adapting to the evolving needs of potential customers due to changes in societal development, standards, market trends, and lifestyles influenced by education and information; 2) maintaining economic viability and environmental responsibility towards capital owners, nature and environment preservation, and cultural achievements of civilization. 

The fundamental element of the tourism sector is hospitality, which the economy equates to a profitable market economy target. Hospitality generates a complex of hotel products and related services, specifically designed, allocated, and well-equipped for mass users, catering to their needs, tastes, capabilities, and desires. 

Theoretically, these are defined by location, views, grounds, facilities, equipment, services, price, brand image, and guest experience. Essentially, the hotel product is the location and services, while the main external elements are service prices and the hotel's image. 

The growth of international tourism, influenced by the overall development of world economy, population standards, and new consumer needs, prompts further development of hotel products in terms of quality, price, specialization, and standardization. This adds value for consumers as it creates new experiences such as entertainment, recreation, rehabilitation, education, shopping desires, personal services, etc. 

The design of hotel products, the subject of this doctoral dissertation, is presented as an artistic technological task and objective for service creators. It serves as a marketing tool for segmentation, positioning, restructuring, or differentiation of the hotel product, and as a visual tool to satisfy tourists' needs in the competitive battle for market share. The primary hypothesis of this dissertation is that successful design of hotel products significantly differentiates them and makes them more marketable, as supported by the accompanying scientific research theory and practice of tourism.
