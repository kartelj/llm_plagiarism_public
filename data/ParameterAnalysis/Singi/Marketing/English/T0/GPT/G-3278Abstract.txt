Cruise companies are increasingly prioritizing the quality of the cruise experience, recognizing its significant impact on tourist satisfaction and future behavior. This dissertation aims to explore the nature of the cruise experience, specifically its antecedents and consequences. The research problem involves gaining a deeper understanding of the cruise experience and developing a method for measuring its antecedents and consequences. 

The author adopts a holistic approach, testing a model of service theater (cruise ship performance) and service quality (quality dimensions). These elements can then be used to design a high-quality cruise experience. The research is grounded in postmodernism, postpositivism, and interpretivism philosophies, using suitable quantitative and qualitative data collection methods. 

The research approach combines induction and deduction, in line with the research philosophies. Structural equation modeling was employed to test the conceptual model. The findings confirmed that employees, guests, service setting, and service quality are the precursors of the cruise experience. However, only experienced emotion had a positive impact on overall satisfaction and influenced future behavior. 

Despite its importance, the nature of the cruise experience has not been extensively studied in academia. This study, therefore, contributes to the ontology of the quality of the cruise experience and the development of its theory. The research was conducted on a cruise ship with guest participation, ensuring all aspects of practical application were considered. The research results hold managerial significance due to the valuable data, insights, and recommendations that can be applied in practice.
