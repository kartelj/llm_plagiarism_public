The negative impacts of financial distress and insolvency on a company's stakeholders can be mitigated through bankruptcy reorganisation, which is a key aspect of effective insolvency law. This dissertation examines how financial distress and bankruptcy reorganisation affect corporate governance mechanisms in large and medium-sized Serbian companies that implemented a reorganisation or pre-pack reorganisation plan between January 2009 and June 2015. It also evaluates the success of these plans and identifies factors that could aid the recovery of Serbia's corporate sector. 

The study found that out of 83 companies, 18 experienced changes in ownership structure and 32 saw changes in top-management structure. The pre-bankruptcy ownership structure of these companies changed after the reorganisation plan was adopted, while top-management turnover remained relatively stable during and after bankruptcy. 

The analysis revealed that a company's liquidity and the involvement of owners in managing the distressed company prior to bankruptcy influenced changes in pre-bankruptcy ownership structure. The size of the company and the bankruptcy procedure used affected top-management turnover. However, the impact of all other variables on pre-bankruptcy ownership and top-management structures was statistically insignificant. 

Regarding the success of bankruptcy reorganisation in Serbia, the study found that 75% of the companies are still in the process of reorganising, while 25% filed for bankruptcy after adopting a reorganisation or pre-pack reorganisation plan. The establishment of a creditor's board or similar body with fewer members after adopting a reorganisation plan could enhance the success of bankruptcy reorganisation in Serbia. 

The findings suggest that bankruptcy reorganisation could be an effective tool for rehabilitating transition economies' corporate sectors, provided it is accompanied by changes in corporate governance practices and institutional and legal reforms.
