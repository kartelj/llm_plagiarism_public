In today's world, the integration of public and private sectors is crucial for societal progress. This thesis focuses on the evolution of the regulatory structure for public-private partnerships (PPP) and concessions in Serbia since 1990. The 1970s and 1980s saw an increase in public participation in private sector projects, particularly in developed countries and mainly in public infrastructure. In Serbia, concessions are not a new concept in the national economic and legal landscape. However, the concept of public-private partnership was only introduced into Serbian law in 2011 with the enactment of the Law on Public-Private Partnership and Concessions. Prior to this, the area was governed by the Law on Concessions at the national level, while private sector infrastructure investments at the local level were regulated by the Public Utility Law. The increasingly complex relationship between the public and private sectors necessitates ongoing institutional engagement through the creation of new rules and regulations to meet market needs. This will be the primary argument of this thesis. The objective of this study is to underscore the significance of the regulatory framework for investment development via PPP and concessions. By providing a historical overview and examples within the dissertation, the aim is to highlight the pros and cons of regulatory frameworks that have emerged through their application, and to emphasize the importance of this issue for the future evolution of regulatory frameworks.
