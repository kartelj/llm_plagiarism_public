The research paper titled “Investment Performance Evaluation of the United States Equity Thematic and Sector Mutual Funds’ Portfolios” has dual objectives. The first is a scientific aim to dissect, scrutinize, and interpret the investment performance of hypothetical portfolios made up of mutual funds with specific stock universes, based on officially sanctioned investment strategies. The second is a social aim to introduce a suitable methodology for evaluating investment performance, which could form the foundation for regulatory standards and offer value to a broad spectrum of internal and external stakeholders. The research methodology employed two sets of models for attributing investment performance, specifically factor and asset-based models. The first group utilized models such as the capital asset valuation model, three-factor Fama-French model, Carhart model, and five-factor Fama-French model. The second group used the Brinson-Hood-Beebower and Brinson-Fachler models, along with geometric models. The study, which focused on thematic mutual funds, incorporated 240 individual funds in the United States. Mutual funds were examined at both the individual and portfolio levels based on a 2x2 matrix of market capitalization and investment style. Each portfolio analyzed consisted of 60 investment funds of a specific investment theme. Factor-based models were used to identify prevailing market factors, and asset-based models confirmed the results of factor models for the dominant investment style. The impact of all observed factors on mutual fund portfolios and individual mutual funds was determined. Factors that aligned with the expectations of the original models included market premium, company size, momentum, and company profitability. Factors that did not align with the expectations of the original models included investment style and company investment conservatism. The results also showed a diversity of excess returns by sector and the presence of momentum in the excess returns by sectors. These findings imply that certain elements of the investment philosophy are reflected in investment strategies that are not purely passive sector tracking. Portfolio annual rebalancing significantly improved returns when a dominant market investment style was anticipated. This is corroborated by the results based on exposure to thematic mutual funds and the annual effects of sector allocation in the sector mutual funds research. Possible inconsistencies with the stated investment strategy were identified by analyzing the realized exposure to observed factors and the portfolio structure. The research concluded that there is a high level of consistency at the portfolio and individual levels based on the influence of factors from the models used. The use of asset-based models, which utilize portfolio and benchmark structure data, yielded results that are more useful as they align better with the investment decision-making process. The combined use of factor models and asset-based models confirmed certain market trends and provided insights that could not be obtained using factor models alone. The limitations of arithmetic models for attributing investment performance over multiple periods were addressed by using geometric models. This led to the successful connection of multi-period returns using geometric attribution models, without residuals, ensuring consistent attribution effects across different periods.
