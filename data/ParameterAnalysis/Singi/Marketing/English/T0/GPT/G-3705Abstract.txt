The worldwide crisis has directly affected all transitioning countries, including ours, leading to a decrease in investments, the departure of foreign investors, and an increase in debts. Despite the rise in non-performing loans, the banking sector in Bosnia and Herzegovina has managed to withstand the more severe effects of the economic crisis, largely due to its conservative policy. This policy eliminates the need for risk-taking as the current business model is profitable. A review of the stock exchange operations in Bosnia and Herzegovina during this period reveals phases of establishment, growth, and then a decline in turnover. This decline is not solely due to the economic crisis but also a mix of internal factors. 

The banking sector, which is heavily privatised and dominated by foreign private capital, is a crucial part of the overall financial system. Here, deposits are the primary source of business operations, and loans are the fundamental product. As loans are commonly used for fund placement and play a significant role in banking, credit risk becomes a cash flow issue and a liquidity problem for banks. This issue is partially the subject of the thesis. To maintain a quality loan portfolio, bank management establishes a clear loan policy that optimises profitability within the bank's acceptable risk parameters. 

The thesis examines the dynamics of non-performing loans in Republika Srpska, based on data from the Banking Agency of Republika Srpska's reports from 2009 to 2016. The study aimed to test econometric theory, provide empirically-based results, and predict future values. Given the nature, development, and current economic conditions in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the focus in controlling banking operations is on credit risk control, liquidity risk, and foreign exchange risk. 

Foreign investors began showing interest in the region's banking market in the early 2000s. Factors such as developed financial and credit markets, GDP level, low inflation rate, economic growth, and productivity attracted these investors. They sought returns, leading to their market entry, dominance, and increased competitiveness. German, Austrian, Italian, and French banks showed the most interest. The arrival of foreign banks brought expected benefits like new technologies and innovations, improved competitiveness and infrastructure, and more foreign investors. Banks with majority foreign capital outperformed local banks by providing better service.
