The financial system's structure has been evolving significantly over several decades. This evolution is evident in the altered importance of certain financial institutions, the merging of various financial activities within complex financial institutions, and the expansion of their operations. The frequent use of mergers and acquisitions among banks and other financial institutions is a part of the restructuring of the financial sector. The substantial increase in mergers and acquisitions among banking institutions in developed EU countries is seen as a part of global processes like bank re-composition and expansion. It is also a result of the creation of a single financial market initiated by the introduction of the euro as a single currency. The increase in competitiveness in both the real and financial sectors is crucial for strengthening bank mergers and acquisitions aimed at enhancing business efficiency and profitability in a globalized context. While bank mergers and acquisitions in developed EU countries typically involve the transfer of ownership rights between private shareholder groups, in transition countries, they usually involve the acquisition of formerly state-owned banks, primarily by foreign banks from developed EU countries. The economic aspect of the banking sector in transition includes increased bank efficiency and profitability, the implementation of modern financial technology, and the use of contemporary risk management methods. To successfully complete mergers and acquisitions, it is necessary to properly project and evaluate them and implement an appropriate post-acquisition integration strategy.
