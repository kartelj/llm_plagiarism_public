The research conducted for this dissertation on the impact of solar attacks revealed that even the most sophisticated electric power system (EPS) protection systems are insufficient against high-intensity solar storms. Factors such as the Earth's weakening magnetosphere, the 2003 Solar storm in South Africa (which shares a similar latitude with Serbia), the destabilization of Venezuela's EPS by the USA in 2019, and Serbia's complex security situation, have necessitated the development of a strategic restructuring plan for the Serbian Electric Power Company. This plan aims to enhance its resilience within a short timeframe. The severe floods in May 2014, which incapacitated the "Kolubara" and "Nikola Tesla A" Thermal Power Plants (TPPs) for an extended period, further underscored the vulnerability of the Serbian EPS to natural disasters. A comprehensive analysis of EPS failures suggests that the model of having fewer, larger electrical energy (EE) producers is flawed, particularly in the EE transmission system to consumers. This flaw can lead to the saturation of high voltage transformers, potentially crippling the entire EPS for 12 to 16 months, as per Lloyd's report. In South Africa, some EPS segments took four years to become operational again. Such disruptions pose a threat to the economy, potentially leading to social unrest and chaos, and can be exploited in hybrid warfare. A review of Serbian publications indicates that the Serbian EPS is modern and transitioning from fewer TPPs to more renewable energy sources (RES) by 2030. Given Serbia's complex security situation in the Balkans, it is crucial that it does not expose any vulnerabilities. This dissertation proposes a new "stand by" concept of creating energy-independent communes within the existing EPS, leveraging the development of underutilized industrial energy. Large production companies can swiftly enhance their backup EE supply systems by converting their thermal blocks into small TPPs and transforming local distribution networks into independent virtual networks with their own EE producers. These producers will form the backbone of energy-independent local administrative units. A study on the change in awareness among Serbian managers regarding the 2017 and 2018 solar storms (before and after media coverage) highlighted the need for a new model to create energy-independent companies for the swift implementation of energy-independent communes. The model's operational mechanism relies on the leadership, excellence, and power of senior managers in leading companies, combined with memetics and crony capitalism. The model's functionality was validated by a hypothesis and a fourth survey conducted among senior management in Serbia. The dissertation also offers practical solutions for protection against solar proton events and highlights the lack of research on health issues caused by solar storms in Serbia.
