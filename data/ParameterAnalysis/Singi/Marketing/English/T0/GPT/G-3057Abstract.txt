The enhancement of cultural assets in Kosovo and Metohija to boost tourism offerings is a crucial issue for the future recognition of the Autonomous Province of Kosovo and Metohija (AP KiM) as a significant tourist destination. Kosovo and Metohija is a region rich in culture, tradition, and the cultural heritage of all its ethnic groups. Their coexistence has led to a blend of cultural influences and, unfortunately, the destruction of cultural markers during conflicts, regardless of their historical and cultural significance. At the time of writing this dissertation, it is stressed that a modern multicultural, multi-confessional, and multi-lingual society can only be achieved through the active preservation of cultural diversity. The valorization of cultural and historical heritage in the former Yugoslavia, where Kosovo was located, was based on cultural values established by laws and regulations within a specific timeframe. However, the economic valorization of cultural and historical heritage was often overlooked. In recent decades, the situation has shifted in the cultural sector, which now receives a portion of the budget over other social sectors. Culture should also become a profit source, as cultural tourism has already been identified as such in some countries. To preserve the rich heritage of all ethnic groups in KiM and the Republic of Serbia, it is essential to implement and innovate the process of valorizing cultural values to boost tourism. The valorization of historical heritage to strengthen tourism should adhere to global criteria, which dictate its protection and preservation process, and contribute to economic development and reconciliation.
