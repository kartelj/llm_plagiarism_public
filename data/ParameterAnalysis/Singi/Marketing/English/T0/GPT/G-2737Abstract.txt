Serbia boasts a rich array of tourist attractions, steeped in history and natural beauty. However, the country's tourism offerings have not been fully developed or marketed internationally. To enhance their global standing, there is a need to boost competitiveness, which necessitates substantial financial investment. Like many developing nations, Serbia views foreign investment as a means to grow this sector, modernize its tourism offerings, increase exports, create jobs, boost income, and prevent migration from less developed regions where tourism may be the only viable development option due to the preservation of resources. 

This dissertation conducts an in-depth analysis of the factors crucial for attracting foreign investment in Serbia's tourism sector. It includes a benchmark analysis of selected competitive countries to understand how they have increased foreign investment in tourism and the outcomes they have achieved. This will also help to comprehend Serbia's competitive standing in relation to these countries. 

Research conducted via questionnaires reveals the extent to which Serbia's tourism sector is attractive to foreign investors and identifies the key areas that need improvement. The research also determines whether Serbian tourism meets the expectations of foreign investors and highlights other critical areas that require immediate attention. 

The final part of the research focuses on the competitive environment of local tourist destinations, using the adapted Porter's Five Forces model. This will help identify opportunities to strengthen the destination's position relative to the five forces, ascertain its strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats, and formulate a strategy to attract foreign investment and enhance competitiveness. 

The aim of this dissertation is to provide insights on how to attract foreign investment in Serbia's tourism sector and suggest measures to enhance the existing environment to boost the sector's competitiveness.
