Over the past six decades, tourism has experienced a positive growth trend, thanks to a range of favourable factors. Despite facing several periods of crisis due to economic and non-economic factors, tourism has shown a strong ability to recover, often growing at a faster rate than the global economy. Since the start of this century, tourism has been impacted by various crises, and it is likely that this trend will continue in the future. This thesis examines the impact of these crises on tourism, focusing on their causes and effects. It pays special attention to the repercussions of the global financial and economic crisis that began in 2008 on the tourism industry. A specific survey was conducted to assess its impact on tourism in Serbia, and the results are included in this thesis. The thesis also proposes specific measures to lessen the negative impact of potential future crises on tourism.
