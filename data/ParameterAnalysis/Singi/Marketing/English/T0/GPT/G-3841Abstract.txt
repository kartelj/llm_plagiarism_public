The evolution of tourism in urban areas has been a significant area of study over recent decades. Researchers' interest in this field is driven by the need to highlight the value of cities as multifunctional tourist destinations, rich in resources and space. Urban tourism is an innovative approach to leveraging existing resources to create new tourist products, thereby enhancing a city's competitive edge in the tourism market. 

Cities offer a unique advantage in tourism by catering to a diverse demographic of tourists with varied travel motivations. Unlike other tourist destinations, cities are less affected by seasonal fluctuations, indicating a consistent influx of tourists throughout the year. Current trends show a growing preference among tourists for shorter, more frequent vacations, often in the form of city breaks. This trend boosts the appeal of cities as tourist destinations, benefiting a wide range of tourism providers. 

This doctoral dissertation focuses on the growth of urban tourism in the Republic of Serbia. To ensure an objective and analytical approach, a comprehensive analysis of the existing tourism offerings from key urban tourism promoters in Serbia has been conducted. The paper presents the findings of empirical research from both the supply and demand sides of tourism, aiming to understand the perspectives of key stakeholders, assess the current state of urban tourism, and provide recommendations for its enhancement. 

The research also includes a survey of tourists to evaluate the quality of the cities' tourism offerings. Interviews with key urban tourism promoters and relevant government officials were conducted to understand their views on the importance of certain resources for urban tourism development, the main challenges, and strategies for improving the cities' competitiveness in the tourism market. 

The ultimate aim of this dissertation is to answer the question of how to enhance the growth of tourism in Serbian cities, based on an objective assessment of the current state of urban tourism development.
