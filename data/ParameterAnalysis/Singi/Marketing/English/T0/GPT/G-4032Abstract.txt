Modelling and Meta-Analysis of the Connection between Economic Development and Energy Efficiency: Energy efficiency, energy consumption, and economic development are interconnected on a global scale and specifically in Serbia. This theory has been validated by identifying a correlation between energy efficiency and economic growth in Serbia, determining that the link between energy consumption and economic growth is causal and measurable, and proving that this causality is applicable to Serbia as well. Energy efficiency indicators and their fluctuation patterns in Serbia suggest that the rebound effect is relevant in this context and that energy consumption can serve as a surrogate for energy efficiency in determining the causality between efficiency and economic growth. A thorough and methodical review of literature using meta-analysis has pinpointed factors that result in varying conclusions in energy-growth nexus research; these factors include differences in research design, political institution stability, economic structure, economic development level, and climate. The link between energy consumption and economic growth in Serbia is causal, multifaceted, and reliant on the type of energy utilized. The findings align with Serbia being a transitioning economy, heavily influenced by its predominant services sector. The research has revealed a significant energy-saving element in determining the causal link between total final energy consumption and gross domestic product. It is crucial to contemplate new tools and policies to enhance energy efficiency. Energy consumption should be incorporated into any growth and development model. Comprehending the influence of energy consumption and energy efficiency on economic growth and development is crucial for formulating suitable economic, energy, and environmental policies.
