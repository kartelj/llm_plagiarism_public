This thesis explores the practical and theoretical issues surrounding the concept of motivation, questioning whether organizations should solely focus on monetary incentives and external factors to enhance performance and employee satisfaction. The self-determination theory, which serves as the foundation of this thesis, suggests that motivation comes in various forms, each with different levels of self-determination. These forms of motivation are organized along a continuum, with intrinsic motivation (the most autonomous and self-determined type) at one end and amotivation (lack of motivation) at the other. Various forms of extrinsic motivation, differing in their levels of autonomy and self-determination, lie between these two extremes. 

This thesis applies the main principles of the self-determination theory to a group of employees in the hospitality industry in the Republic of Serbia, with the goal of enhancing motivational techniques and methods. It investigates how social environmental factors like work climate and job type influence the structure of motivation (autonomous/regulated/amotivation), and subsequently, job satisfaction and individual wellbeing. 

The research was carried out on employees from 4 and 5-star hotels in Belgrade. The data collected was analyzed using SPSS, version 23, employing descriptive analysis (arithmetic mean, standard deviation), the Cronbach Alpha Coefficient to determine the reliability of the scales used in the sample, and statistical conclusion. The Pearson correlation coefficient, T-test, and analysis of variances were used to test connections and differences based on measured characteristics. The findings of this research validate the applicability of the self-determination theory principles in a work context.
