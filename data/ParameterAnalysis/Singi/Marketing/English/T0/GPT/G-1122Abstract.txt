This thesis has demonstrated the significant and complex role that tourist guiding plays in modern tourism, particularly in showcasing destinations and attractions to visitors. Tourist guiding typically takes the form of a guided tour, chosen voluntarily by customers. Its informal nature aids in the effective communication of information, messages, knowledge, and emotions. A high-quality, safe tourism experience provided by a guided tour involves the interaction of the tourist guide, tourists, and the environment at a specific place and time. This interaction leads to various relationships between the tourists and the environment, tourists and the guide, and among all three parties. The guide's narration and management of group dynamics significantly influence the tour participants' experience. Therefore, tourist guides not only impact the quality of a destination's overall tourism product but also the products of individual tour operators and travel agencies. Their role in the tourism system is unique in its ability to manage and coordinate tourism experiences, promote destinations, and achieve sustainable and responsible tourism goals. The way tourist guides present and interpret a place or attraction affects how their customers experience it, understand the local culture, participate in tourist activities, and behave during their stay. As a presenter and interpreter, the tourist guide serves as a representative and "ambassador" of the destination to tourists. The guide's influence can determine whether tourists feel welcomed, choose to extend their stay, or decide to return. The guide can shape tourists' perceptions of a destination and sometimes even become a symbol of the destination. Without a doubt, tourist guiding is a crucial strategic factor in successfully showcasing destinations in modern tourism, significantly influencing the tourism experience, length of stay, and resulting economic and social benefits.
