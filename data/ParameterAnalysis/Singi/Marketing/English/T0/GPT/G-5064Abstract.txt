Modern retail is primarily driven by dynamic business conditions. The growth of a business is contingent on its ability to swiftly and accurately respond to market challenges, spurred by increased demand and subsequent revenue growth. The contemporary fast-paced retail model negates inventory shortages, as delivery delays can lead to lost sales, customer dissatisfaction, and a reduction in competitive edge. This paper aims to explore the influence of demand forecasting on inventory management, and to establish a universal methodology for both. The scientific and theoretical aspects of inventory management determinants have been systematically examined in this context. A thorough analysis of the importance of multi-criteria demand management for inventory control highlights key factors for studying the efficiency of demand forecasting. The primary research objective was to pinpoint the unique characteristics of demand in current business conditions, and to showcase the effective use of forecasting methodology as a crucial aspect of inventory management. A business that does not rely on demand prediction as a factor in inventory management is unlikely to be sustainable in the long run. The research utilized data from the retail store of Winwin Shop Čačak, forecasting demand for four product categories across over 100 retail stores, accounting for over 40% of total sales. The findings indicate that demand forecasting is crucial for enhancing retail efficiency in today's business environment. The multi-criteria method, the Analytical Hierarchical Process, formed the mathematical foundation of the research, with the Expert Choice software solution providing support for estimating and predicting future product demand. The results affirm the importance of demand forecasting in optimizing inventory and improving company efficiency. However, the influence of subjectivity on the demand prediction process can be reduced, but not entirely eliminated.
