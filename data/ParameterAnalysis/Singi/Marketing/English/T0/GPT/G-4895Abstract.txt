The tourism and hospitality sectors are becoming increasingly vital to the economies of many countries, with infrastructure investment significantly aiding overall growth. This infrastructure, along with a wide array of tourist products and services, helps to halt the deterioration and decline of rural areas. Digital transformations, characterized by interactivity and personalization, are an inevitable part of globalization and the increasing mobility of the labor market. In this context, tourism and hospitality businesses promote job openings, tailoring their efforts to specific audiences based on extensive digital data about potential candidates. Non-linear communication methods and the distribution of promotional content allow individuals to access a wealth of advertising based on their interests and skills. Research for a doctoral thesis confirmed that media should not be seen merely as passive conveyors of one-way messages, but as interactive platforms providing feedback from a dynamic labor market. The study also affirmed the indispensable role of social networks in the recruitment process. Balancing long-term development driven by convergent media communications and short-term economic interests, tourism and hospitality businesses require a well-thought-out strategy to attract suitable candidates with the necessary knowledge, experience, and skills.
