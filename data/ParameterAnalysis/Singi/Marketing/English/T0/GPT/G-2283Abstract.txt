The aim of this research is to assess the competitiveness of Serbia's economy, the efficacy of its competitiveness policies, and the role of clusters in enhancing regional competitiveness. The methodologies employed to evaluate these hypotheses were developed by the World Economic Forum, the Center for Strategy and Competitiveness, the University of Stockholm, and the European Cluster Observatory. The study also sought to establish the relationship between the strength of clusters in various regions, as measured by the location quotient, and GDP per capita as a productivity indicator, in five countries, namely Hungary, Bulgaria, Greece, Romania, and Serbia, collectively referred to as G-5. The data used in this study was sourced from the Statistical Office of Serbia, EUROSTAT, the World Economic Forum, and the European Cluster Observatory. The findings indicate a decline in Serbia's competitiveness indicators, particularly when compared to other countries at a similar development stage, and that the measures taken to enhance competitiveness are inadequate. In the G-5 countries, a positive correlation was found in 13 out of 20 cluster categories analyzed between the strength of clusters in the regions and regional competitiveness.
