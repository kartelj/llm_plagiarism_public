The thesis delves into a relatively uncharted area of study, examining the impact of printing and packaging processes on the properties of printed flexible packaging materials. It also involves determining their values using suitable multicriteria evaluation techniques. Experimental analysis of flexible packaging materials has been conducted, with their varying degrees of changes assessed and contrasted. The study and evaluation have certain restrictions, mainly pertaining to the chosen packaging materials and the nature of the packaged contents. The outcome of this evaluation is a clear total of the values of individual versions of printed flexible packaging materials. This allows for the calculation of each material's ability to meet the requirements for different food products.
