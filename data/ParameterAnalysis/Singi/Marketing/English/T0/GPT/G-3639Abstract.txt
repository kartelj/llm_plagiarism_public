This dissertation aims to explore the potential use of the ARIMA model for predicting crude oil prices, and the subsequent management of market risk in oil companies using the VaR method. It also discusses their application in the intricate system of managing companies involved in the production, processing, and distribution of crude oil. The ultimate objective of any company, including oil companies, is to maximize profitability, achieve its planned rate, or consistently generate profit, irrespective of time and business conditions. It is vital to keep market risk within acceptable boundaries, necessitating timely corrective measures to minimize risks while optimizing funding sources, considering quantities, deadlines, and prices. The findings corroborate the assertion that oil companies should employ suitable models for predicting oil price trends and managing business risks associated with crude oil to keep market risk within acceptable parameters. This forms a solid foundation for making future business decisions in volatile times. Future research will focus on the application of other existing and new models and methods, and their amalgamation, testing of extreme events for predicting crude oil prices, and managing market risks in the business operations of companies in the crude oil production, processing, and distribution sector. To ensure a steady supply and maintain mandatory crude oil reserves at the necessary level, future studies will consider the risk of a country and energy security as prerequisites for the functioning of the economy and all its constituents, as well as potential users of this finite resource.
