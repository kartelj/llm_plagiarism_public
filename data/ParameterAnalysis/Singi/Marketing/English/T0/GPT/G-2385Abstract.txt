The number of mobile phone users is growing daily. Looking at the evolution of mobile devices, it's clear that manufacturers have created highly advanced devices, aptly named smartphones. These devices, with their increased capabilities and impact on our daily lives, have made us increasingly reliant on them. Smartphones are utilized for a variety of tasks including phone calls, internet browsing, messaging services, and use of camera or GPS features. 

However, with the advancement of mobile technology, security issues have also emerged, particularly in the communication channel, or the data transfer from sender to recipient. The security threats to these devices are escalating due to a lack of sufficient security mechanisms and protective tools. The introduction of mobile operating systems has further complicated this issue. Each operating system offers numerous benefits to users, but also presents a host of security vulnerabilities. 

Given the growing popularity of internet access via mobile devices, there are risks associated with secure communication and establishing a communication channel. With the widespread use of mobile devices, it's crucial to address mobile communication security for all users. 

Open source projects provide developers with a platform to create their own solutions based on their ideas. Access to an operating system's source code has led to the creation of an operating system that has outperformed all others and become a market leader in the mobile phone world. The Android operating system, which is based on the Java programming language, has rapidly gained popularity among developers and users alike due to its open platform that allows for modifications at the operating system level. 

This gives developers the chance to create unique security mechanisms not typically found on other mobile platforms. The Android operating system, which is based on the Linux operating system and is part of the Open Source Association, has evolved to version 7.0 in the seven years since its inception. 

This paper analyzes the security mechanisms of the Android operating system, identifies certain weaknesses in its low-level security framework, and suggests measures for improvement using SE Linux. A comparison is made between the Android Open Source Project (AOSP) and the proposed Security Enhanced (SE) Android system. The paper concludes with future directions for work in this area.
