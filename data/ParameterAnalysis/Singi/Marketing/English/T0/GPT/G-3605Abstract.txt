This paper provides a comprehensive review of pertinent sources from both traditional and modern literature in the areas of Communication, Organizational Science, Social Psychology Values, and Change Management. It critically examines the limitations of individual research, content analysis, and the comparison of similar surveys conducted on specific respondents. The research for this dissertation was conducted across several countries with a suitable sample to enhance the relevance and purpose of the results. The survey involved 342 participants, 200 of whom completed an online survey from 5 regional countries and 10 western hemisphere countries. The remaining respondents received the questionnaire through personal contacts. 

The findings from the field research were compared with published studies from both local and international literature, and an analysis of the similarities and differences was conducted. The paper seeks to establish whether there are statistically derived indicators that demonstrate a correlation between an organization's external communication (i.e., the organization's communication with the public) and the socio-personal values of its employees. 

Factor analysis of the sample revealed six indicators of an organization's external communication. Correlations and other statistical methods confirmed a relationship between the indicators of an organization's external communication and the socio-personal values of its employees, thus proving the main hypothesis of this research. 

Modern research, particularly in local literature, lacks a systematic exploration of external communication as a form of organizational behavior. Specifically, there is a dearth of research examining the organization's external communication in relation to the values, desires, needs, motivation, and corporate identity of its employees. 

The study also found a positive correlation between the success of an organization's external communication and employee motivation. Furthermore, it revealed a significant difference in value priorities between employees who are open to change and those who resist it. This aligns with previous research, which attributes this to "internal motivation". 

In conclusion, given the new scientific information provided by this dissertation, the discussion and final conclusions propose ways to better implement the research findings in organizational systems and their internal and external communication channels.
