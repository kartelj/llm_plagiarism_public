This dissertation examines the effects of water usage on Libyan agriculture and the resulting ecological indicators. Libya, a predominantly dry and arid country with the Sahara desert covering about 95% of its land, relies heavily on groundwater, which constitutes approximately 95% of its water resources. The country's arable and pasture lands are primarily located in the northern part of the narrow Mediterranean coastal line. 

The agriculture sector, which contributes to about 9% of the GDP, consumes 85% of the total water supply and 12% of electricity. This indicates mismanagement and unsustainable practices within the sector. Three ecological indicators were selected to assess the environmental impacts of water usage in agriculture: water consumption, land use, and water pollution. 

The environmental sustainability index is poor due to the high water consumption in agriculture, particularly in the densely populated northern region. This has led to serious environmental issues such as seawater intrusion with groundwater, water pollution, and soil salinization. Overuse of groundwater in the southern region has resulted in a decline in the groundwater level in the upper layers, leading to the drying up of some desert lakes. 

To mitigate the damage caused by water usage in agriculture, a sustainable solution is proposed: the use of seawater as a renewable and sustainable water source. This involves exploiting seawater for coastal desert agriculture in Libya using salt-tolerant plants, particularly those used for animal feed. 

The reasons for exploiting seawater include the lack of underground water inventory in coastal areas, fluctuating rainfall amounts, the high population in coastal areas leading to a large drain of groundwater, and the need to conserve groundwater and surface water inventories as they are non-renewable. 

A sustainable approach is also suggested for energy generation, using the Great Man-Made River (GMR) to generate energy from water movement across the GMR pipeline using appropriately sized turbines. 

In terms of agriculture, the GMR could be converted from supplying freshwater to coastal cities into a large agricultural project after establishing several seawater desalination plants. This would allow for the conversion of thousands of desert hectares around the pipelines into a large agricultural project irrigated from the GMR. 

The transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources for power generation is crucial, as agricultural expansion means more consumption of underground water and fuel, leading to increased environmental pollution. While solar energy is a promising renewable energy source in Libya, this thesis also explores other sustainable, clean, and environmentally friendly energy sources. These include generating power from the movement of water across the GMR pipe and the movement of vehicles on roads, known as Smart Roads. These techniques represent a wise policy and increase the variety of sustainable energy sources, marking a step in the right direction towards the exploitation of new technologies for clean, renewable, and sustainable energy.
