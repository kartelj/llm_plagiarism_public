The Serbian banking sector faced unique challenges from 2008 to 2016, which altered the ease of managing liquidity. This study examines the difficulties that management structures of domestic commercial banks encountered due to unstable markets and their responses to situations of no/low liquidity. It also explores the relationship with the established FTP system. In the Serbian banking sector, where hedging instruments are not fully developed, a strong correlation was observed between the FTP system, the development of financial instruments, and the concept of Asset and Liability Management (ALM). The study also questioned the application of a uniform FTP system model in banks during periods of liquidity, particularly between 2008 and 2016, and the implementation and implications of "best practices" and new principles known as Basel III. 

A comparative analysis was conducted on two commercial banks in Serbia during the liquidity crisis at the end of 2008. The findings revealed a high sensitivity of bank systemic and specific factors, limitations of liquid financing sources, and shallow domestic markets that significantly increased funding costs and deepened maturity mismatch balance, especially in the case of Bank B. Bank A showed similar high sensitivity to systemic risks arising from the insolvency of the banking sector. Access to short-term funds to overcome the liquidity crisis was not fully effective, considering that Bank B deepened maturity mismatches four years later. 

The study found that both Bank A and Bank B, due to the illiquid interbank market, significant deposit outflow sources, increased interest rates, and low levels of regulatory liquidity coefficient, resorted to different strategies. Bank A issued shares and changed its ownership structure, while Bank B borrowed funds at prices higher than the market and postponed the liquidity problem to the following year. 

The first hypothesis that commercial banks apply modern concepts of liquidity risk management was rejected after empirical analysis of the banking sector. This is mainly because many commercial banks rely solely on regulatory requirements for liquidity risk. The second hypothesis was also rejected as it was found that the FTP system is sensitive to liquidity conditions and the illiquidity of the banking sector. The third hypothesis was accepted, proving through empirical analysis the existence of links and ALM positions in commercial banks and their direct correlation with the FTP system.
