Wine tourism, a niche tourism sector experiencing significant global growth, should be a key component of Serbia's tourism offerings. This is particularly relevant given Serbia's lack of mass tourism attractions, including within its wine regions. This study examines the impact of wine tourism on the global market and its potential role in Serbia's tourism sector, focusing on the Vrsac region. The aim is to identify opportunities and potential for wine tourism development in Serbia through research, analysis, and comparison. 

The study involves a comparative analysis of the importance of various aspects of wine tourism supply and marketing activities for two distinct groups: visitors/wine tourists and winery managers. The methodology includes identifying characteristics of wine tourism, defining its unique features, analyzing Serbia's wine tourism supply, and examining the role of marketing in wine tourism development. 

The study also compares the attitudes of visitors/tourists and winery owners/managers towards the importance of specific aspects of supply and marketing activities. It then identifies the strengths and weaknesses of Serbian wine tourism. 

The research results reveal the nature of wine tourism, its role in niche tourism and the development of specific tourism destinations, the importance of strategic marketing and specific supply segments for the development and quality positioning of Serbia's and Vrsac's wine tourism offerings on target markets, and the effectiveness of various marketing tools for the development, promotion, and positioning of Serbia's and Vrsac's wine tourism. 

The study also identifies the most effective marketing channels for communicating messages from Serbia's and Vrsac's wine tourism suppliers to target markets, and the key stakeholders in the development of wine tourism in Serbia and Vrsac. 

The research concludes that wine tourism, though still in its early stages, has significant potential to enhance Serbia's overall tourism offerings. However, winery owners and managers have not fully utilized marketing opportunities, which could threaten the survival and development of this tourism sector. Conversely, this also presents an opportunity to achieve market positioning through education and appropriate application of knowledge.
