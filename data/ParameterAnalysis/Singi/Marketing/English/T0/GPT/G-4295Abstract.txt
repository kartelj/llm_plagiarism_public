Serbia is actively participating in the process of aligning with the European Union's acquis, which involves harmonizing its national technical legislation with EU laws. The country has made significant strides in waste management, achieving a high level of compliance with key EU directives in this field. However, the practical application of these directives is still in its early stages, despite some progress in waste collection and sanitary landfill disposal. 

Waste management is a primary responsibility of the state, with the main objective being to minimize environmental pollution and utilize waste as a resource. EU regulations on environmental protection are detailed, specific, and comprehensive, yet flexible enough to allow member states to adapt their implementation methods to their constitutional and institutional order. 

However, Serbia's existing infrastructure for hazardous waste treatment is not yet equipped to meet the requirements of the EU's New and Global approach. The development and adaptation of new methods and technologies, as well as the construction of facilities for applying these new technologies to the treatment of specific types of hazardous waste, is a lengthy and costly process. 

Therefore, it is crucial to mobilize all available resources at the national level to facilitate the harmonization and implementation of environmental protection and waste management legislation. This will not only contribute to human health and economic development, but also meet the needs of current and future generations. 

The current state of hazardous waste management in Serbia reveals a total lack of any form of hazardous waste treatment and location. This paper proposes a solution for the disposal and complete destruction of hazardous waste, which is a significant issue for many companies in Serbia. The proposed treatment plant will handle hazardous waste such as PCB oil, Ni-Cd batteries, and biodegradable waste. 

The paper outlines the current situation regarding hazardous waste and the accompanying legal regulations, and proposes a methodological procedure for using plasma technology to achieve total waste disposal and energy conversion into heat and electricity. It also presents a comprehensive business model that would be profitable.
