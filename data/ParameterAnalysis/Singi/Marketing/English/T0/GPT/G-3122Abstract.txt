Spas in Serbia are a significant attraction for both local and international tourists. The spa tourism industry is constantly evolving to meet the changing needs and demands of tourists. The increasing sophistication of tourist demands and their desire for relaxation and recreation in Serbian spas necessitates the need for providers to adapt their offerings to stay competitive. One way to achieve this is by using a mix of communication methods to reach potential tourists. Despite the growing interest, many tourists are physically distant from these spa services, making it crucial to provide them with information about the services and amenities offered by Serbian spas. The use of modern information technology in promoting spa tourism has brought significant benefits for both tourists and providers. For marketing professionals in Serbian spas, the benefits include easier, more cost-effective, and comprehensive contact with potential tourists. From the tourists' perspective, the benefits of information technology include easy access to spa offers and the ability to share images and other content about their spa experiences. This study focuses on both traditional and digital communication methods and their use in promoting Serbian spas, as well as their role as information sources in the decision-making process of potential spa visitors. A review of the online presence of selected spa destinations revealed that while all spas have a website, they are not fully utilizing the potential benefits of online promotion. An analysis of social media usage showed inconsistencies, with those responsible for communicating with potential tourists failing to regularly update information and content. A study was conducted to determine the impact of traditional and digital communication methods on the decision to visit a spa destination, with the aim of establishing the need for an optimal mix of these methods when targeting potential visitors to Serbian spas. The results showed that tourists typically choose Serbian spas based on television advertising and recommendations from friends. In terms of digital media, Facebook and website presentations were the most commonly used information sources. For the successful development of Serbian spa tourism, it is crucial for marketing professionals to use an appropriate combination of traditional and digital communication methods.
