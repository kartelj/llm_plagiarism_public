The technological structure and intensity of Serbia's merchandise exports improved between 2000 and 2014. However, these changes did not significantly enhance the structure of domestic exports or foster conditions for robust, sustainable long-term growth. The quality of Serbian merchandise exports, as indicated by the proportion of higher-level processed goods, significantly trails behind EU countries and, to a lesser extent, transitioning Central European economies.

This paper examines the quantitative shifts in the technological structure and intensity of domestic merchandise exports, focusing on changes in the share of skill-intensive manufactures and high to medium-high technology products in total exports from 2000 to 2014. It is crucial for Serbia to attract modern technology and investments, particularly through Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), in competitive sectors to diversify its export offerings.

Improvements in employment policy regulations and a comprehensive overhaul of the science and education system are necessary. A targeted industrial policy and strategies at the sector and firm level are needed to drive a shift towards technology-intensive activities with higher spill-over effects. For Serbia, export-led growth necessitates an expansion of foreign trade. The institutional framework for expanding foreign trade is already in place, as evidenced by the EU's Stabilization and Association Agreement with Serbia and the Central European Free Trade Agreement (CEFTA).

Despite constraints on imports due to subdued total euro area demand and the recent depreciation of the euro, it is significant for Serbia that euro area import demand is projected to grow moderately in 2015 and 2016.

This research highlights the importance of external environmental factors and competitiveness strategies, and their correlation with the identified critical competitiveness indicators of small and medium-sized enterprises in transition economies. By adapting to the environment and removing key obstacles through the implementation of appropriate competitive strategies, the strategic positioning of small and medium-sized enterprises in the transitional context can be improved.

Serbia requires a new concept of systemic competitiveness, which encompasses both political and economic determinants of successful industrial development. This concept involves deliberate efforts by state and social actors to create conditions conducive to successful industrial development. It differentiates between four levels: the microlevel of the firm and inter-firm networks, the mesolevel of specific policies and institutions, the macrolevel of generic economic conditions, and the metalevel of slow variables such as socio-cultural structures, the basic order and orientation of the economy, and the capacity of social actors to formulate strategies.
