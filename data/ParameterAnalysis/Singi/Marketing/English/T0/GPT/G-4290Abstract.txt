In today's economic climate, international financing is essential for meeting societal needs and ensuring the smooth functioning of modern societies. This dissertation focuses on the role of international financing, particularly by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), one of the leading investment organizations in the European economy, and its impact on the market and economy of Serbia. 

International financing in Central and Eastern Europe, as we understand it today, began in 1990 with the establishment of the EBRD to assist transitioning countries. In Serbia, international investment organizations have been providing funding since 2001, following the lifting of international sanctions. This funding is crucial for the Serbian economy, particularly during the transition process after economic sanctions and a significant drop in Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in the 1990s. 

The complexity of economic relations, new technologies, and production necessitates additional financing sources, which is the primary focus of this dissertation. The research aims to explore the significance and necessity of foreign investment institutions and contribute to their continued growth. 

All Central and Eastern European countries have had successful and extensive cooperation with the EBRD through investment loans, joint project financing, and joint ventures in various sectors, primarily energy, infrastructure, transport, and finance. The goal is to transform these economies into market economies and integrate them into the future unified European market. 

The research concludes that a national economy cannot recover without strategic and well-planned borrowing from international financial institutions, coupled with appropriate monitoring and control. Fiscal sustainability and monetary stability are crucial prerequisites for this type of financing due to the complexity of business relations and trends. Reliable, cost-effective international investments are essential for economic growth and development. 

The economies that have worked with the EBRD have experienced significant economic growth and improved business performance compared to recession periods. Despite the benefits of cooperation with the EBRD, the professional public in Serbia is not sufficiently aware of its importance, highlighting the need for a rational approach to the country's credit indebtedness. 

The dissertation also examines the impact of investments made in collaboration with the EBRD on Serbia's economic recovery and transition, finding a positive correlation between these investments and Serbia's GDP growth rate. The analysis confirms the EBRD's significant role in economic recovery and transition through financing and advisory services. The dissertation underscores the benefits of cooperation with the EBRD and emphasizes the importance of certain activities and measures to enhance this cooperation.
