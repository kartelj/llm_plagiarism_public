The PhD thesis theme explores the understanding and application of ethics in integrated marketing communications across various marketing domains, including advertising, marketing research, and marketing model development. It focuses particularly on communication with the target audience, especially children and youth. The study reveals the potential impact of brand products on purchasing decisions and media choices made by young people. It also examines children's consumerist and materialistic attitudes, particularly when influenced by advertising.

The communication strategy of a company dealing with children's products and services differs from a general communication strategy. When targeting young people, the integrated marketing communication model should adhere to ethical principles, rules, and codes in all marketing activities.

The primary hypothesis suggests that integrated marketing communications move away from mass communication and towards targeted, ethically conducted interactions with both existing and potential customers. Supplementary hypotheses investigate the impact of advertising on young people, the effect of brand products and services on children's purchasing decisions, the emergence of parent-child conflicts due to frequent exposure to advertising, the disparity between the world portrayed in advertisements and reality, and the potential increase in children's materialistic values as a result of advertising stimuli.

The findings indicate that younger students have a more positive attitude towards advertising and a preference for branded products and services than older students. It is clear that frequent exposure to advertisements leads young people to request purchases, thereby increasing parent-child conflicts. Most children do not believe that the world depicted in advertisements reflects reality. The study confirms that children's materialistic values increase due to advertising stimuli.
