The process of decision making always includes a risk component among other factors. Insurance companies base their operations on this concept of risk. They have developed numerous actuarial methods and models to balance revenues and costs, meet profit goals, and maintain solvency simultaneously. 

Insurance companies' business transactions are a vital part of every national economy. To minimize risks and ensure the safety and stability of financial flows, a state sets up regulations and procedures to define the legal framework of their business activities. 

Insurance companies establish various reserves to maintain solvency. Technical reserves are used to cover future insurance contract liabilities. These reserves are essential for managing expected risks such as damages, insured sums, and compensations. Insurance companies also collect additional capital funds (guarantee reserves) to cover unexpected risks like catastrophic events and unforeseen business losses. 

As institutional investors, insurance companies invest their reserve funds in the financial market. The primary market risk management during the investment process involves aligning assets and liabilities to maintain long-term solvency. 

Insurance companies' business operations are also affected by numerous other risks, including strategic, operational, credit, and legal risks. Identifying, classifying, and monitoring these risks requires extensive knowledge about the methodology and specific aspects of risk management in insurance companies. Research indicates that applying risk management in practice is crucial for improving business performance.
