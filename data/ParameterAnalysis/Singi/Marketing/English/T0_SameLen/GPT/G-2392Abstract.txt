The Phd thesis theme explores the understanding and interpretation of ethics and integrated marketing communications, applying ethics across various marketing domains, from advertising and marketing research to marketing modeling and promotional mix, and communication with the target audience, particularly children and youth. The study's findings, based on communication methods and techniques, reveal the potential impact of brand products on purchasing decisions, media choices made by young people, attitudes towards advertising, and the exploration of consumerist and materialistic attitudes in children, especially when influenced by advertising. The development of a unique communication strategy by a company in the children's products and services market differs from a company implementing a general communication strategy. Applying an integrated marketing communication model to young people requires adherence to ethical principles, rules, and codes in all child-focused marketing activities. The primary hypothesis suggests that integrated marketing communications abandon mass communication and that the company surpasses targeted contact access to both existing and potential customers ethically. Auxiliary hypotheses help the research demonstrate the impact of advertising on young people; the measurement effects of brand products and services on children's purchases; the emergence of parent-child conflicts due to frequent exposure to advertising; the comparison of the advertised world and the real world, and the potential increase in children's materialistic values as a result of advertising stimuli. The findings indicate that younger students (lower primary school grades) compared to older students (higher primary school grades) have a more positive attitude towards advertising and a preference for branded products and services. It is conclusively determined that frequent exposure to advertisements prompts young people to request purchases, thereby increasing parent-child conflicts. Generally, children do not believe that the world depicted in advertisements matches the real world. It is confirmed that children's materialistic values increase due to advertising stimuli.
