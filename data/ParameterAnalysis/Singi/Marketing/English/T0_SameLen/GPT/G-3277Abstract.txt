Tourism, as a component of the global system, must construct its unique social system, structure, relationships, institutions, and visual (design) expression, taking into account two key factors: 1) the need to adapt and respond to the evolving needs of potential customers, which are influenced by changes in societal development, standards, market trends, methods, and lifestyles, all of which are shaped by education and information; 2) the necessity to be economically sustainable and environmentally conscious, considering the interests of capital owners, environmental preservation, and the cultural accomplishments of civilization. The fundamental element of the tourism sector is hospitality, which the economy equates to a profitable market economy objective. Hospitality generates a complex hotel product and associated services, specifically designated, designed, and well-equipped for mass consumers, catering to their needs, tastes, capabilities, and desires. Theoretically, it is defined by location, views, grounds, facilities, equipment, services, price, and brand image, and guest experience is considered an outcome rather than a component of the hotel product. From these examples, it can be inferred that the primary elements of the hotel product are location and services, while the main external factors are service prices and hotel image. The growth of international tourism, influenced by the overall development of world economy, population standards, and new consumer needs, facilitates further development of hotel products in terms of quality, price, specialization, and standardization, all of which add value for consumers as they provide new experiences such as entertainment, relaxation, rehabilitation, education, shopping desires, personal services, etc. The design of hotel products, the subject of this doctoral dissertation, is presented as an artistic technological challenge and objective for service creators, a marketing tool for segmentation, positioning, restructuring, i.e., differentiation of the hotel product, and a visual tool to satisfy tourists' needs in the competitive battle for market share. The central hypothesis of this dissertation, that successful design of hotel products significantly differentiates them and makes them more marketable, is supported by the accompanying scientific research on tourism theory and practice.
