The dissertation explores the significance of sustainability in contemporary destination governance, particularly in alpine and dinaric mountain destinations. Initially, a comparison is drawn between the application of sustainability in destination governance by destination management organizations (DMO) in the Alps and the Dinarides. Quantitative data was gathered through a survey, which was utilized to examine the disparities between the two regions in terms of implementing sustainability principles in destination planning, leadership/management styles in destination governance/management, destination development priorities, and the value attributed to various stakeholders. Subsequently, a comparison is conducted between the two most developed mountain destinations in Serbia, Kopaonik and Zlatibor, using the integrated framework for sustainable tourism indicators. This identified areas of weakness and provided recommendations for enhancements in both destinations. Lastly, an interview methodology is employed to delve deeper into the methods and resources available for implementing sustainable tourism in the German Alps, serving as a model for alpine regions that can inform the development of mountain tourism in the Dinarides. The interviewees discussed topics such as strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats in the destination; sustainability and related project initiatives and plans; key stakeholders of sustainable tourism, natural resources and their conservation; indicators of sustainable development; and cross-border collaboration. The topic of ecotourism naturally arose as a significant issue during the interviews.
