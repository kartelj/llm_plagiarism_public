The financial system's structure has been experiencing significant transformations for many decades. These transformations are evident in the altered importance of certain types of financial institutions, the integration of various financial activity groups within complex financial institutions, and the expansion of their activities' scale and scope. The prevalent use of mergers and acquisitions among banks and other financial institutions takes place within the framework of financial sector restructuring. The substantial increase in the number of bank mergers and acquisitions in developed EU countries is viewed as an integral component of global processes such as bank restructuring and expansion, as well as a consequence of the establishment of a single financial market triggered by the introduction of the euro as a single currency. Enhancing competitiveness in the real and financial sectors is crucial for bolstering bank mergers and acquisitions aimed at improving business efficiency and profitability in the context of globalization. While bank mergers and acquisitions in developed EU countries represented a transfer of ownership rights between private shareholder groups, in transition countries, they typically involved the acquisition of formerly state-owned banks, primarily by foreign banks from developed EU countries. The economic aspect of the banking sector in transition includes increased bank efficiency and profitability, the adoption of modern financial technology, and the use of contemporary risk management methods. To ensure the successful completion of mergers and acquisitions, it is essential to properly project and evaluate these transactions and implement an appropriate post-acquisition integration strategy.
