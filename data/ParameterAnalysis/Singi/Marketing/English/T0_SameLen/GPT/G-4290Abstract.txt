In today's economic climate, global financing to address societal needs is essential for a functioning modern society. This dissertation explores the emphasis placed on international financing by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, a leading investment organization in the European economy, and its impact on Serbia's market and economy. This form of international financing, as we understand it today, began in 1990 in Central and Eastern European countries when the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development was established to assist transitioning countries. In Serbia, international investment organizations have been providing funding since the international community lifted sanctions in 2001. This funding is crucial, as without it, the Serbian economy's situation and the rate of activity during the transition process following the economic sanctions and a significant drop in the Gross Domestic Product in the 1990s would be worse. Complex economic relationships, new technologies, and production necessitate additional financing sources, which this dissertation primarily studies. The research aims to examine the significance and necessity of foreign investment institutions and contribute to their continued growth. All Central and Eastern European countries have had successful, comprehensive collaborations with the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development through investment loans, joint project financing, joint ventures in various sectors, primarily energy, infrastructure, transport, financial sector, with the goal of transforming these economies into market economies and integrating the future unique European market. The research's main conclusion is that a national economy cannot recover without planned, well-structured borrowing from international financial institutions, with proper monitoring and control. Given the complexity of business relationships and opportunities, fiscal sustainability and monetary stability are crucial prerequisites for this type of financing. The influx of cost-effective, reliable international investments supports economic growth and development. The transition process's economic development cannot be imagined without additional international financing. It's worth noting that all economies that collaborated with the EBRD experienced overdeveloped economic growth and better business results than during recession years. Despite the benefits of cooperating with the EBRD, the professional public in our country is not adequately aware of its significance, highlighting the need for a rational relationship with the country's credit indebtedness. This dissertation also examined the impact of investments implemented in cooperation with the EBRD on the economic recovery and transition of the RS economy and the influencing factors, finding a positive correlation between these investments and the RS's GD growth rate and the positive impact of EBRD's investments on the Republic of Serbia's GDP growth rate. The analysis confirmed the EBRD's significant role in economic recovery and transition through financing and advisory services. The dissertation highlighted the benefits of cooperating with the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development through a detailed review of economic trends and numerous examples of specific project implementations, drawing attention to the importance of certain activities and measures to enhance this cooperation.
