The influence of foreign direct investment on the current account is multifaceted, potentially being either positive or negative based on the total investment amount and its sectoral allocation. The dissertation presented a theoretical and empirical examination of the effect of FDI on Serbia's trade balance and income account, particularly focusing on its impact on the Serbian manufacturing sector. Additionally, an investigation into the effect of foreign direct investment on technology transfer in Serbia was conducted, along with a study of its capacity to facilitate access to global markets, its influence on the composition and specialization of exports and imports, and its effect on the appreciation of the exchange rate. The thesis also presented an analysis of the reasons for the current account deficit in Central and Eastern European countries, and an exploration of the influence of foreign direct investment on the sustainability of the current account deficit, considering that foreign direct investment is a significant financing source for the current account deficit and can establish conditions for the occurrence of financial contagion through various channels.
