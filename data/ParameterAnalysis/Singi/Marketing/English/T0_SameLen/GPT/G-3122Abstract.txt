Serbian spas are a key tourist attraction, appealing to both local and international visitors. This tourism sector is continually evolving to meet changing tourist demands. The increasing sophistication of tourist expectations and their desire for relaxation and recreation at Serbian spas necessitates that providers adapt their offerings to outperform competitors. One strategy for achieving recognition and competitiveness is to employ a mix of communication methods to engage potential tourists. Despite growing interest, many potential spa-goers are geographically distant from these facilities, necessitating informative outreach about Serbian spa services and amenities. The use of modern information technology in promoting spa tourism has yielded significant benefits for both tourists and providers. Marketing professionals in Serbian spas benefit from efficient, cost-effective, and comprehensive contact with potential tourists. Tourists benefit from easy access to spa offerings and the ability to share images and experiences from their spa visits. This study examines traditional and digital communication methods and their use in promoting Serbian spas, as well as their role in informing tourists' decisions to visit specific spas. An examination of the online presence of selected spa destinations revealed that while all spas have websites, they are not fully utilizing the promotional potential of this platform. An analysis of social media usage, including Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest, and Google+, revealed inconsistent engagement. Communication professionals often underestimate the importance of regularly updating information and content on social media. A study of the impact of traditional and digital communication methods on spa visitation decisions was conducted to test the hypothesis that an optimal mix of these methods is necessary to attract potential Serbian spa visitors. The results indicated that tourists typically choose Serbian spas based on television advertising and recommendations from friends. Digital media, particularly Facebook and website presentations, also serve as important information sources for tourists. For the successful growth of Serbian spa tourism, it is crucial that marketing professionals employ an effective combination of traditional and digital communication methods.
