Urban tourism development has been a significant research focus in recent decades. Scholars' interest in this area stems from the desire to highlight the value of cities as multifunctional tourist destinations. Urban tourism is an innovative method of leveraging existing resources to create a new tourist product, enhancing cities' competitiveness in the tourism market. The comparative benefits of urban tourism lie in cities' capacity to offer suitable experiences for tourists of varying demographics and travel motivations. Furthermore, compared to other tourist destinations, cities experience less seasonal fluctuation, indicating a consistent, year-round influx of tourists. Modern tourism trends show an increasing preference for shorter, more frequent vacations, often realized as city break trips. This trend enhances cities' appeal as tourist destinations, contributing to the achievement of many tourism providers' goals. This doctoral dissertation's primary focus is the development of urban tourism in Serbia. To provide an objective, analytical approach, a thorough analysis of Serbia's key urban tourism promoters' current offerings was conducted. The paper presents empirical research results from both the supply and demand sides of tourism, examining relevant stakeholders' attitudes to draw conclusions about urban tourism's current state and suggest improvement strategies. Tourist attitude research was conducted to assess the quality of Serbian cities' tourist offerings. Key urban tourism promoters and relevant state institution employees were studied to analyze their perspectives on specific resources' importance for urban tourism development, key development issues, and strategies for improving Serbian cities' competitiveness in the tourism market. The dissertation aims to answer how to enhance urban tourism development in Serbia, considering the current level of urban tourism development objectively.
