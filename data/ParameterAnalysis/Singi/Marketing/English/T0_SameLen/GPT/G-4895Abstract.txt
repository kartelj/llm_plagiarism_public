Tourism and hospitality are becoming increasingly vital to the economies of many countries, with infrastructure investment significantly aiding overall growth. This infrastructure, along with a wide array of tourist products and services, helps to halt and reverse the deterioration and decline of rural areas. Interactivity and customization form the foundation for digital transformations, which are an inevitable part of globalization and the hypermobility of the job market. In this context, tourism and hospitality businesses promote job openings, tailoring their efforts to specific audiences based on extensive digital data about potential candidates. Concurrently, non-linear communication methods and the distribution of promotional content allow interested parties to access a wealth of advertising material based on their interests and skills. Studies conducted for a doctoral thesis confirmed that media should not be seen merely as passive conveyors of one-way messages, but also as interactive platforms providing feedback from a fluctuating job market. Information on the use of social media during the recruitment process underscored their indispensability as key communication platforms. Amid the ongoing clash between long-term development driven by convergent media communications and short-term economic interests, tourism and hospitality businesses require a well-thought-out and structured strategy to attract candidates who possess the necessary knowledge, experience, and skills.
