Modern retail is primarily influenced by dynamic business conditions. The company's growth is contingent on its ability to swiftly and accurately respond to market challenges, driven by increased demand and subsequent revenue growth. The new, fast-paced retail model suggests that inventory shortages are not an issue, as delivery delays can lead to lost sales, customer dissatisfaction, and a reduction in competitive edge. This paper aims to examine the effect of demand forecasting on inventory management, and to establish a universal methodology for both. The scientific and theoretical aspects of nearly all inventory management determinants have been systematically organized in this context. A thorough analysis of the importance of multi-criteria demand management for inventory control highlights key factors for studying the efficiency of demand forecasting. The primary research objective was to pinpoint the unique characteristics of demand in contemporary business conditions, and to showcase the effective use of forecasting methodology as a crucial aspect of inventory management. A business that does not rely on demand forecasting as a factor in inventory management cannot sustain itself in the long run. The research utilized data from the Winwin Shop Čačak retail store, forecasting demand for four product categories across over 100 retail stores, accounting for over 40% of total sales. The analysis results indicate that demand forecasting is crucial for enhancing retail efficiency in today's business environment. The multi-criteria method, the Analytical Hierarchical Process, served as the mathematical foundation for the research, with the Expert Choice software solution providing support for estimating and predicting future product demand. The findings underscore the importance of demand forecasting in inventory optimization and improving company efficiency. However, the influence of subjectivity on the demand forecasting process can be reduced, but not entirely eliminated.
