The study "Investment Performance Evaluation of the United States Equity Thematic and Sector Mutual Fundsâ€™ Portfolios" has dual objectives. The academic aim is to break down, scrutinize and interpret the investment performance of hypothetical portfolios made up of mutual funds with specified stock universes, based on officially recognized investment strategies. The societal aim is to introduce a suitable methodology for investment performance evaluation, which would form the foundation for establishing regulatory standards, and also offer value to a broad spectrum of internal and external stakeholders. The employed research methodology encompassed two categories of models for investment performance attribution, specifically factor and asset-based models. Within the first category, the following were utilized: capital asset valuation model, three-factor Fama-French model, Carhart model, and five-factor Fama-French model. Within the second category, Brinson-Hood-Beebower and Brinson-Fachler models were utilized, along with geometric models. The study, which focuses on thematic mutual funds, incorporated 240 individual funds in the United States. Mutual funds were examined at the individual and portfolio level based on the 2x2 matrix of market capitalization and investment style. Each of the examined portfolios is made up of 60 investment funds of a specific investment theme. Using factor-based models, the prevailing factors in the market were identified. Also, the application of asset-based models validated the results of factor models for the dominant investment style. For all observed factors, it was feasible to ascertain the impact on the portfolios of mutual funds and individual mutual funds. The influences of factors that align with the expectations of the initial original models are market premium, company size, momentum, and company profitability. The influences of factors that do not align with the expectations of the initial original models are investment style and company's investment conservatism. The results of investment performance attribution also highlighted the heterogeneity of excess returns, observed by sector. There is also the existence of momentum in the realized excess returns by sectors. These findings imply that certain elements of the investment philosophy have been mirrored in investment strategies that are not purely the result of passive sector tracking based on the realization of exposure. Based on the portfolio annual rebalancing, it was feasible to significantly enhance returns in the instances when the presence of a dominant market investment style was anticipated. This is corroborated by the results based on exposure to thematic mutual funds and the annual effects of sector allocation in the research related to sector mutual funds. By examining the realized exposure according to the observed factors, as well as by examining the portfolio structure itself, it was feasible to identify the occurrence of potential inconsistencies with the stated investment strategy. Based on the analysis of the research findings, it was concluded that there is a high degree of consistency at the portfolio and individual level based on the influence of factors from the applied models. The application of asset-based models, which utilize data about the portfolio structure and the benchmark, has enabled the acquisition of results that can be more beneficial as they can be better aligned with the investment decision-making process. The complementarity of the application of factor models with asset-based models enabled the confirmation of certain current market trends but also provided insight into aspects that were not possible using factor models alone. The limitations of arithmetic models for investment performance attribution based on multiple periods have been overcome by applying geometric models. This resulted in the successful linking of multi-period returns by applying geometric attribution models, without residuals. Consequently, this ensures consistency of attribution effects throughout different presented periods.
