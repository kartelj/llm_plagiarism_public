This doctoral thesis is motivated by the observed lack of sufficient or appropriate use of psychology and consumer understanding in marketing management. The focus is on new product development, a complex and financially risky process that necessitates thorough analysis and understanding of the entire marketing management process. The thesis examines the use of psychology in new product development, using the case study of the instant coffee products, Grand Instant and Doncafe Instant, in the Serbian market from 2007 to 2015. Empirical data is based on primary and secondary sources. Primary data was gathered through quantitative methods from a representative sample of 800 respondents aged 18 to 30, to analyze attitudes and customer satisfaction, as well as qualitative methods (with quantification of specific questions) based on interviews with managers from both companies (Grand and Doncafe), to understand company-level processes and attitudes. The analysis was conducted using descriptive statistical methods. Secondary data on brand performance (market share, share value, brand familiarity, brand loyalty, strength and brand image, and consumer perception) were derived from longitudinal studies conducted by three regionally recognized market research agencies. The thesis investigates whether psychology was applied with the necessary knowledge, understanding, and appreciation in new product development. The main hypothesis, that inadequate attention to consumers and psychological processes in new product development affects product success and consumer satisfaction, was confirmed. Consumers were viewed as a group expected to react to a product, as dictated by trends in neighboring countries. Despite new product development being a complex process that requires knowledge and application of all marketing management principles, it is often oversimplified. The initial assumption, that marketing managers rely on psychology in new product development and recognize its importance but only use it superficially, was also confirmed. However, this is not solely due to time-limited competitiveness, but other factors as well. The second assumption, that consumers feel they are not adequately involved in the process and express this through dissatisfaction and non-use of the product, was confirmed. In the case study analyzed, consumers were not satisfied with how Grand Kafa and Doncafe engaged them in new product development. Initiating new product development based on consumer needs and meeting their expectations, as mandated by the marketing concept, underscores the undeniable importance and contribution of psychology in marketing. The thesis concludes that, in practice, Serbian companies, in addition to insufficient use of psychology in new product development, face deficiencies related to the process itself - such as lack of acceptance of the marketing concept, production of certain formal documents, and strategic planning as well as consumer research. A modification of the new product development model is proposed to address these four identified deficiencies by requiring the production of formal documents at various stages of product development, which necessitates consumer research and strategic planning, thereby ensuring adherence to the modern marketing concept.
