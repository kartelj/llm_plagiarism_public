Mobile phone usage is on the rise daily. Looking at the evolution of mobile devices, it's clear that manufacturers have created highly advanced devices, aptly named smartphones. Their enhanced capabilities and impact on our daily lives have made us increasingly reliant on these modern mobile phones. Smartphones are utilized for various purposes such as phone calls, internet browsing, using different services (SMS, MMS, email), camera or GPS usage. As mobile technology advances, the first security issues arise, affecting the communication channel, or the data transfer from sender to receiver. The security risks to these devices are growing due to a lack of sufficient security mechanisms and protective tools. The introduction of mobile phone operating systems has further complicated this issue. Each operating system offers numerous benefits to users, but also presents several security vulnerabilities. Considering the rising popularity of internet access via mobile devices, there are risks associated with secure communication and establishing a communication channel. With the widespread use of mobile devices, it's crucial to address mobile communication security for all users. Open source projects provide developers with a platform to create their own solutions based on their ideas. Access to an operating system's source code has led to an operating system that has outperformed all others and become a global market leader in mobile phones. The Android operating system quickly gained popularity among developers and beyond due to its reliance on the Java programming language. Android serves as an open platform for mobile devices, allowing modifications even at the operating system level. This gives developers the chance to create unique security mechanisms not typically found on other mobile platforms. The Android operating system is based on the Linux operating system and is part of an Open Source Association. In the seven years since its inception, up until the writing of this paper, the Android operating system has advanced to version 7.0. This paper analyzes Android's security mechanisms, identifies certain weaknesses in the low-level security framework surrounding the system, and suggests the need to enhance Android's security framework based on the results. Measures for improvement, specifically enhancing security using SE Linux, are proposed. A comparison is made showing the differences between the AOSP (Android Open Source Project) and the proposed SE Android (Security Enhanced) system. The paper concludes with future work directions.
