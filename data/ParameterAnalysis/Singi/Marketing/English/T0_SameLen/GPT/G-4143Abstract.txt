This dissertation's research topic is the examination of profitability, pinpointing the fundamental determinants of profitability, and their influence on the profitability of agricultural businesses in the Republic of Serbia. The theoretical perspective elucidates the uniqueness of agriculture and agricultural production, the significance of agriculture for economic growth, and the role and value of agricultural businesses for agricultural advancement. The distinctions between the traditional and contemporary methods of assessing company performance are clarified, and the primary standards of these two methods are provided and theoretically expounded. The dissertation encompasses both theoretical and empirical research. The theoretical scrutiny of the research topic is bolstered by the research findings of local and international authors, while the empirical analysis was carried out based on regular financial reports on the operations of agricultural businesses and various reports on the movement of individual macroeconomic variables. The sample comprises 151 agricultural businesses involved in primary agricultural production, and the research spanned from 2014 to 2018. Statistical analysis of these businesses' profitability revealed that the observed agricultural businesses generally operated successfully, generating profit throughout the entire observed period. The profitability analysis from different indicators' perspective demonstrated that businesses vary in their success, and these variations also exist from the temporal perspective. Besides determining the profitability level and differences in the profitability level among individual agricultural businesses, one of the main goals of this dissertation was to identify the reasons (factors) why some businesses are profitable and others are not. In the process of identifying statistically significant profitability determinants, determinants commonly used in most research to measure the impact on businesses' profitability were utilized. In this context, the following internal profitability determinants that the company can influence were used: company size, liquidity, indebtedness, sales growth, and assets materiality. Moreover, the impact of the following external profitability determinants, which the company cannot influence, was considered: gross domestic product and inflation. To address numerous questions stemming from this objective, the econometric panel model technique was employed, as it allows data observation from both temporal and spatial aspects, providing abundant information, efficiency of evaluated indicators, and objectivity of conclusions. Before drawing conclusions about the influence of individual determinants on profitability, it was confirmed that all variables used in this study are stationary, that there is no high correlation between them, i.e., that there is no multicollinearity issue and also that there is no heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation problem in the regression model. Furthermore, in line with the conducted statistical tests and the demonstrated statistical significance of these tests, it was concluded that the fixed effect regression model is the most suitable. Ultimately, it was discovered that the company size, as a profitability indicator, has a positive and statistically significant impact on the return on assets rate, while liquidity, indebtedness, gross domestic product, and inflation have a negative and statistically significant impact on profitability. The remaining two factors, sales growth and assets materiality, do not have a statistically significant effect on the return on assets rate (profitability). The findings of this empirical research will equip the management of the analyzed businesses and other users with strategies to facilitate future business decision-making.
