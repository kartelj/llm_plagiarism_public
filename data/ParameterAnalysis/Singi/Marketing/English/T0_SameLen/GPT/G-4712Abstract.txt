The thesis delves into a largely uncharted area of the impact of printing and packaging procedures on the properties of printed flexible packaging materials, and the calculation of these values using suitable multicriteria assessment techniques. Experimental analysis of flexible packaging materials has been conducted, with their variations in changes assessed and contrasted. In the study and assessment, constraints have been established, mainly concerning the chosen packaging materials and the nature of the packaged contents. The outcome of this assessment is a clear total of the values of different versions of printed flexible packaging materials, where the satisfaction of the requirements for each food product can be computed for each material.
