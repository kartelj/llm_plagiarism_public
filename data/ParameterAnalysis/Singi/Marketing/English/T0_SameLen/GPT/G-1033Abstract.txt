Modern nations endorse tourism development as a key export industry, viewing it as a revenue source and a means to increase employment. Amidst global competition and numerous worldwide destinations, these countries must invest significant funds to foster development and establish their competitive edge. Serbia's unfavorable competitive standing globally, low investment levels, the global economic crisis's impact on foreign direct investment, and a dearth of project investments, have led the Serbian Government to see potential in implementing specific public-private partnership forms and creating a conducive environment for their execution, following successful international models. Investment forms and methods are dictated by investor strategies and national regulations. The intricate and mutually significant relationship between the private partner and national enterprise is amplified in public-private partnership projects. This relationship takes on considerable social and political dimensions, particularly regarding national infrastructure investments. Consequently, due to limited funds, Serbia views public-private partnership projects as another chance to revitalize existing businesses, enhance their operations, activate new capabilities, and generate new jobs. This thesis aims to highlight the opportunities that public-private partnerships offer through long-term organizational models and procedures to boost Serbian tourism's competitive position and alleviate public finances.
