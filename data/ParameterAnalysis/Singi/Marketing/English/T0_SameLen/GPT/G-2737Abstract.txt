Serbia boasts a variety of tourist attractions, a rich history, and well-preserved resources. However, the country's tourism offerings have not been effectively developed or marketed internationally. To improve their standing, it's crucial to enhance competitiveness, which necessitates substantial financial resources. Like many developing nations, Serbia views foreign investment as a chance to grow this sector, modernize its tourism offerings, boost exports, create jobs, increase income, and prevent migration from underdeveloped regions where tourism may be the only development opportunity due to the well-preserved resources. This dissertation conducts a thorough analysis of the factors important for attracting foreign investment in Serbian tourism, followed by a benchmark analysis of selected competitive countries to understand how they increased foreign investment in tourism and the outcomes achieved in this sector, as well as Serbia's competitive position relative to these countries. Based on questionnaire research results, it uncovers the extent to which the attractiveness factors for drawing foreign investment into Serbian tourism are met and identifies the key areas that need immediate improvement. The questionnaire-based research also reveals whether Serbian tourism's attractiveness meets foreign investors' expectations and identifies other critical areas that need priority attention. The final research focuses on the competitive environment of the local tourist destination using the adapted Porter's Five Forces model, identifying opportunities to strengthen the destination's position relative to the five forces to ascertain its strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats, and to formulate a strategy for attracting foreign investment to enhance its competitiveness. This dissertation aims to help answer the question of how to attract foreign investment in Serbian tourism, or what steps should be taken to enhance the existing environment to increase this sector's competitiveness.
