This thesis's findings highlight the significant and diverse role of tourist guiding in modern tourism, particularly in showcasing destinations and attractions to visitors and tourists. Tourist guiding functions as a guided tour chosen voluntarily by customers, and its casual nature aids in the effective conveyance of information, messages, knowledge, and emotions. A secure and high-quality tourism experience provided by a guided tour involves the tourist guide, tourists, and the environment, and is achieved when all three elements interact simultaneously. Various relationships are then formed, between tourists and the environment, tourists and the guide, and among all three parties. The guide's commentary (narration) and his management of tour group dynamics significantly influence the guided tour participants' experience. Therefore, it can be argued that tourist guides impact not only the quality of a destination's overall tourism product but also the product of individual tour operators and travel agencies. Their role in the tourism system stands out for its ability to manage and coordinate tourism experiences, promote destinations, and achieve sustainable and responsible tourism goals. What tourist guides present and interpret affects how their customers experience a location or attraction, comprehend local culture, participate in tourist activities, and behave during their stay. As a presenter and interpreter, the tourist guide serves as a destination's representative and "ambassador" in the eyes of tourists. Whether tourists feel welcomed, choose to stay a bit longer, or return depends on him. He is the one who shapes tourists' perceptions of a destination, and he or she sometimes even becomes a destination brand. Without a doubt, tourist guiding is a crucial strategic factor in successfully presenting destinations in modern tourism, significantly influencing the tourism experience, the duration of stay, and the resulting economic and social benefits.
