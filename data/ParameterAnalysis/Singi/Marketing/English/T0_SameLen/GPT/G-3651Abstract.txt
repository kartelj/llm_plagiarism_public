The significance of maintaining natural ecosystems, which offer a range of ecosystem services to humanity, is becoming a more prevalent subject from both a scientific and practical perspective. This paper aimed to identify the diversity, potential, importance, and state of all elements of natural ecosystems in Libya's larger protected areas. It suggests conservation models and sustainable usage of natural ecosystems in Libya's protected areas, particularly in terms of their long-term preservation and sustainable development of local communities in the current challenging economic and political climate in Libya. Libya's protected areas are not only areas of natural value, but also a resource that can provide significant ecosystem services, benefiting the local population, if used sustainably. The following values and resources of Libya's protected areas are examined: abiogenic factors (topography, geological background, soil, water, climate), biogenic factors (flora and fauna, vegetation), population (composition and structure, socioeconomic characteristics, traditional lifestyle, traditional and modern activities, potential directions for sustainable development of local communities in line with natural values and traditional lifestyle, and the importance of Libya's protected areas for the state's strategic development. strategic documents, primarily a sustainable development strategy, biodiversity conservation, desertification combat, fisheries development and other strategic documents relevant for comprehensive environmental, nature and local population interest policies. For Libya to join nations that have adopted a national sustainable development strategy, it should be facilitated by the development of a competitive market economy and balanced economic growth, people's development and education, increased employment and social inclusion, infrastructure development and balanced regional development, environmental protection and rational use of natural resources. Based on a study of two respondent groups in two protected areas in Libya, it can be concluded that Libya's protected areas are a source of natural values and resources that provide ecosystem services to the local population, as most respondents from the local population group confirmed that they benefit from using resources from the protected area, mainly related to food sources for families or selling food to occasional tourist visitors to both research sites. By establishing the right relationship with the values and resources of the protected areas, their long-term protection, enhancement and use is ensured, as the resources from the researched protected areas are used sustainably and there is no over-exploitation (even though these resources are relatively limited). The coordinated development of local communities in protected areas contributing to the state's strategic development has not been fully demonstrated, as the local communities in the research areas are too small. The development of tourism in Libya will significantly improve this situation, but it is necessary first to develop environmental protection awareness in people who do not live near protected areas through education at all levels, starting from the youngest ages. A necessary condition is also the implementation of international obligations and the adoption of national strategies with the achievement of a higher level of ecological responsibility through the fulfillment of legislative, institutional, personnel, technical and other assumptions, in line with international and national practice.
