From a perspective of process optimization and cost reduction, enhancing business operations is a common objective for all business systems. Recent advancements have relied on the latest technologies, primarily focusing on specific business segments like equipment maintenance through work orders and troubleshooting result analysis. However, these improvements didn't consider the entire process, from defect notification to defect elimination. Consequently, the suggested solutions were incomplete and occasionally led to entirely incorrect analysis outcomes. The proposed solution involves defining a method to encompass the entire process, selecting the most optimal standard for recording, analyzing, and optimizing the process, and choosing a suitable data format that aligns with the analyzed process and the defined objects recorded during the process. Hence, the solution relied on applying the appropriate standard for such a process, achieved through multi-criteria analysis and professional literature review, using a data warehouse as a universal data structure, and adopting object process data warehouse with target analysis parameters and defined limit values after further analysis. The primary results from the analysis indicated that using the selected standard for process recording provided essential elements for optimization, and the object process data warehouse offered a high-quality, realistic database. By converting data from a relational structure to a data warehouse structure, a straightforward structure was achieved, allowing dynamic data access, grouping, and specialization. Additional extensions concerning threshold and target values fully validated the applied concept. This concept demonstrated that, while the maintenance system appeared highly successful (equipment uptime >95%) when only considering the work order, over 30% of interventions indicated delays in troubleshooting when viewing the entire process.
