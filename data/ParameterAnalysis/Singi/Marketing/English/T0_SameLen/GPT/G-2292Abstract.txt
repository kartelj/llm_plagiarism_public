The thesis explores the theoretical and practical examination of large public corporations in the Republic of Serbia, focusing specifically on their operational efficiency, a critical assessment of privatizations in the Republic of Serbia and transition nations, proposed privatization models, and strategic privatization recommendations. The study identifies the primary role of public corporations, compares efficiency between private and state ownership in public corporations, scrutinizes corporate governance in public corporations, and offers a worldwide perspective on the significance and role of public corporations and their privatization. A review of the use of contemporary management techniques is provided, and their contribution to efficiency improvements is examined. Emphasis is placed on the relevance of public-private partnerships and the need for corporatization of public corporations. The significance of privatization in enhancing efficiency and performance of public corporations is illustrated. Views on the privatizations and corporatization of the public corporation "Elektroprivreda" and the joint-stock company "Telekom" are also shared.
