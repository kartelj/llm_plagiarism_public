The thesis titled 'Problems of Assessing Value of Small and Medium Enterprises in Different Life Cycle Stages' made a significant contribution to the methodological understanding of linking two unexplored business economy phenomena. The research's subject and aim were highlighted in the INTRODUCTION, along with the problem, hypothesis, methodology, and anticipated research contribution. The first section, THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK: OVERVIEW OF CURRENT RESEARCHES IN THE FIELD OF INTERACTIONS OF DEVELOPMENT STAGES AND ASSESSING VALUE OF SMALL AND MEDIUM ENTERPRISES, underscored the importance of small and medium enterprises for national economic development, particularly in transitional and post-transitional countries undergoing mergers, reengineering, restructuring, and downsizing. These modern business challenges can be tackled with a suitable small and medium enterprise development policy. Recognizing that different enterprise development stages present different challenges is crucial for understanding its impact on enterprise value. To adequately link these two areas for study, methodical concepts and methodologies for assessing the value of small and medium enterprises and diagnosing their development stage were systematically organized within the methodological framework. Methodical concepts for assessing the value of small and medium enterprises encompass methods and methodologies for such assessments. This paper utilized the book value assessment method, the yielding value method, and the liquidation value determination method. The methodology consists of three stages: preparation, implementation, and conclusion. Methodical concepts for diagnosing small and medium enterprise development include models and methodologies for such diagnoses. The models used in this paper are for determining metamorphosis change, behavioral change, and structural change. The methodology consists of three stages: development management, development diagnosis, and development direction. The second part of the paper, Methodological Framework: Overview of Current Methodology in the Field of Interaction of Development and Value Assessing of Small and Medium Enterprises, discusses the selection of the methodological framework. The St.Gallen methodology was applied, providing a sequential overview of four standard ideal development models with suggested criteria. For a sample of 55 small and medium enterprises, it was determined whether they belonged to one of the four phases. Fifteen enterprises were excluded from the sample because their phase could not be determined. The remaining 40 enterprises were divided into the four ideal standard phases, with each phase comprising 10 small and medium enterprises. The book, yielding, and liquidation values were assessed and determined for each enterprise. Subsequently, the performance of small and medium enterprises was evaluated using Klariceks DF and Belaks BEX models and future predictions were made using Klarickes Quick Test model. In the third part of the work, titled: APPLICATIVE FRAMEWORK: OVERVIEW OF CURRENT RESEARCH IN THE FIELD OF INTERACTION OF DEVELOPMENT PHASES AND ASSESSING VALUE OF SMALL AND MEDIUM ENTERPRISES, hypotheses were tested, particularly the central hypothesis and four auxiliary hypotheses. This section discussed the validity of the interaction of development phases and the selection of the proposed methodology. In the CONCLUSION, a synthesis of the research was presented, along with the work's most significant findings and recommendations and guidelines for future research.
