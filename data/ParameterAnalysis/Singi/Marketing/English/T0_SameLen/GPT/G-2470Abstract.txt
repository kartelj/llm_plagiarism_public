The overhaul of Serbia and Yugoslavia's primary education system from 1944 to 1959, from the conclusion of World War II to the enactment of the General Education Law in 1958, which established a standard eight-year primary school across the nation, a system still in place in Serbia, is the culmination of the "fight for education" that began in Serbian society in the late 19th century. It is intrinsically linked to the push for modernization and democratization in both Serbian and Yugoslavian societies in the 20th century. The reform that led to the establishment of the standard eight-year primary school in 1958 was part of the fight for a "new education". It's worth noting that the intensive efforts to define new educational and upbringing policies and initiate reforms of existing educational systems began immediately after World War II, largely due to the efforts of the UN organization, specifically UNESCO. The continuation of the fight for a "new" education, which was interrupted by the world wars, was particularly spurred by the "new" recognition of childhood, which had suffered significant losses during World War II. The reform of the primary education system from 1944 to 1959 was part of the fight for societal cultural transformation, which the revolutionary, communist government of Yugoslavia began when the first government bodies were established. The journey towards a better and fairer, or socialist, society was through the political stabilization of the country, which could not be achieved without economic recovery or, as it was often emphasized, "overall societal progress", which also encompassed "cultural life". "Cultural life", including "educational life" as a key component, was thus seen as an integral part of the "socialist transformation of society" from the outset. The decisions made at the Fifth Congress of the CPY (1948) had far-reaching effects on both the country's cultural policy and the education and upbringing policy, as it received its main directives with the Resolution of the Third Plenary Session of the CC of the CPY, which was passed in December 1949. All state institutions, especially schools, were to support the new education and upbringing policy and seek assistance in the fight for the socialist man. Schools had to depend on a complex system of mass organizations, with the Pioneer Organization being the most notable, and on "reliable" party cadre, on a large number of experts in psychology, pedagogy, film, arts, literature, and music who were associated with the Council of Societies for Child and Youth Care of Yugoslavia, and on the millions of parents "overlooked" in the previous century who had to play their part in the construction of socialism, just like other citizens of the socialist community. In this way, the "new" education policy helped foster the concept of school as the starting point for societal modernization or cultural revolution and the construction of socialism.
