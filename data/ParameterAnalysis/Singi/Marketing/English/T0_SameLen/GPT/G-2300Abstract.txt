The Serbian banking sector faced unique circumstances from 2008 to 2016, making liquidity management more complex. This study examines the challenges domestic commercial banks faced due to fluctuating markets and their responses to situations of no/low liquidity, as well as their relationship with the established FTP system. In a banking sector like Serbia's, where hedging tools are not fully developed, a strong correlation was observed between the FTP system and the development of financial instruments, and the implementation of Asset and Liability Management (ALM). The study also questioned the application of a uniform FTP system model in banks during periods of liquidity, recalling the significant liquidity between 2008 and 2016, as well as the adoption and implications of "best practices" and new principles known as Basel III. 

A comparative analysis was conducted on two commercial banks in Serbia during the liquidity crisis at the end of 2008. The findings revealed a high sensitivity of bank systemic and specific factors, limitations of liquid financing sources, and shallow domestic markets that significantly increased funding costs and deepened maturity mismatch, especially for bank B. Bank A showed similar high sensitivity to systemic risks from banking sector insolvency, and its access to short-term funds to mitigate the liquidity crisis was not entirely effective, considering that bank B deepened maturity mismatches four years later. 

The study found that due to the illiquid interbank market, significant deposit outflow sources, increased interest rates, and low levels of regulatory liquidity coefficient, Bank A resorted to issuing shares and changing its ownership structure, while Bank B borrowed funds at prices "higher" than the market and deferred the liquidity problem to the following year. 

The first hypothesis that commercial banks use modern liquidity risk management concepts was rejected after empirical analysis of the banking sector, mainly because many commercial banks rely solely on regulatory requirements for liquidity risk. The second hypothesis was also rejected as it was found that the FTP system is sensitive to liquidity conditions and the banking sector's illiquidity. The third hypothesis was accepted, proving through empirical analysis the existence of links and ALM positions in commercial banks and their direct correlation with the FTP system.
