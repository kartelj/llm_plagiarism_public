This thesis aims to explore the potential of utilizing the ARIMA model for forecasting crude oil prices, and subsequently managing market risk in oil companies using the VaR method. This is to be implemented within a comprehensive system for managing companies involved in the production, processing, and distribution of crude oil. The objective of any company, including oil companies, is to maximize profits, achieve its planned rate, or consistently generate profit regardless of time and business conditions. It is vital to keep market risk within acceptable boundaries, necessitating management to implement corrective measures in a timely manner and minimize risks while optimizing funding sources, considering amounts, deadlines, and prices. The findings corroborate the assertion that oil companies should employ suitable models for predicting oil price trends and managing risks associated with crude oil business to keep market risk within acceptable parameters, providing a solid foundation for future decision-making in business entities during unstable periods. Future research directions will encompass the application of other existing and new models, methods, and their combinations, and testing extreme events for predicting crude oil prices and managing market risks in the business operations of companies in the crude oil production, processing, and distribution sector. To ensure a steady supply and maintain mandatory crude oil reserves at the necessary level, future studies will consider country risk and energy security as prerequisites for the functioning of the economy and all its stakeholders, as well as potential users of this finite resource.
