Financial hardship and bankruptcy can negatively impact a company's management, owners, suppliers, employees, customers, and other stakeholders. Efficient bankruptcy law, through the process of bankruptcy reorganisation, can ensure the survival of insolvent but economically viable businesses. The main issues concern the impact of financial distress and bankruptcy reorganisation on key corporate governance mechanisms, and how these changes, along with the application of bankruptcy rules and time spent in bankruptcy, affect the success of implemented reorganisation plans. This dissertation aims to explore the impact of financial distress and bankruptcy reorganisation on key corporate governance mechanisms in large and medium-sized businesses that implemented a reorganisation plan or pre-pack reorganisation plan in the Republic of Serbia from January 2009 to June 2015. It also examines the success of the implemented reorganisation plans and pre-packaged reorganisation plans with the goal of identifying factors that can aid in the recovery of the Serbian corporate sector. Of the 83 sample companies, 18 experienced changes in ownership structure, while 32 saw changes in top-management structure. In the companies studied, the pre-bankruptcy ownership structure changed after the reorganisation plan was implemented, while top-management turnover remained relatively stable throughout both the bankruptcy period and the first year following the implementation of the reorganisation plan. A logistic and OLS regression analysis shows that two factors influenced changes in the pre-bankruptcy ownership structure: the company's liquidity and whether the owners were involved in managing the distressed company before bankruptcy was declared. Additionally, the logistic and OLS regression results provided evidence that the company's size and the bankruptcy procedure applied influenced top-management turnover in large and medium-sized distressed Serbian companies. The impact of all other observed variables on pre-bankruptcy ownership and top-management structures was found to be statistically insignificant. Regarding the success of bankruptcy reorganisation in the Republic of Serbia, this dissertation's findings show that 75% of the companies studied are still reorganising, while 25% of companies filed for bankruptcy after implementing the reorganisation plan or pre-packaged reorganisation plan. The establishment of a creditor's board or similar body with fewer members after implementing a reorganisation plan or pre-packaged reorganisation plan can enhance the success of bankruptcy reorganisation in the Republic of Serbia. Overall, the analyses in this dissertation suggest that bankruptcy reorganisation could serve as an effective tool for rehabilitating the corporate sector in transition economies. However, this process must be accompanied by changes in corporate governance practices and institutional and legal reforms.
