Serbia is playing a significant role in the process of aligning with the European Union's acquis, having developed a system and adjusted its national technical laws to match EU legislation. In the field of waste management, it has reached a satisfactory level of compliance with key EU directives. However, the practical application and execution are still in the early stages, despite some progress in waste collection and sanitary landfill disposal. Waste management is a primary state responsibility, with the main aim of the program being to reduce environmental pollution and utilize waste as a resource. EU environmental protection regulations are specific, comprehensive, yet flexible enough for member states to adapt their implementation methods to their constitutional and institutional order. Serbia's existing hazardous waste treatment infrastructure is not ready to meet the directives based on the EU's New and Global approach. Developing and adapting methods and new technologies, building facilities for new technology application in treating specific hazardous waste types, and professional training is a lengthy and costly process. Therefore, it is essential to mobilize all available national resources to aid in aligning and implementing environmental protection and waste management legislation, which will benefit human health and economic growth while meeting the needs of current and future generations. The hazardous waste management system in Serbia shows a total lack of any hazardous waste treatment and location. This paper was written to propose a solution for the disposal and complete elimination of hazardous waste, which is a historical issue for many Serbian companies. The proposed hazardous waste treatment plant will focus on disposing of PCB oil, Ni-Cd batteries, biodegradable waste, etc. The paper outlines the current hazardous waste situation and accompanying legal regulations, offers a solution and methodological procedure on how plasma technology can achieve total waste disposal and energy conversion into heat and electricity, and presents a profitable consumption business model.
