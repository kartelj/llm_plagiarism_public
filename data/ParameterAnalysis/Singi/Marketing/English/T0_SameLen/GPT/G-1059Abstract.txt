Over the past six decades, tourism has shown a positive growth trend due to various favourable factors. Despite facing several periods of crisis caused by economic and non-economic factors, tourism has demonstrated a significant recovery potential, registering growth rates higher than the global economy. Since the start of this century, tourism has been impacted by crises, and it is likely to continue in the future. The thesis examines the impact of crises on tourism, focusing on their causes and effects. It pays special attention to the repercussions of the global financial and economic crisis that began in 2008 on tourism. A specific survey was conducted to determine its impact on Serbian tourism, and the findings are presented in the thesis. Furthermore, the thesis proposes specific measures to alleviate the potential negative effects of future crises.
