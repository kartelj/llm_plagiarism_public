Economic Growth and Energy Efficiency: Analysing the Connection and Meta-Analysis Energy efficiency, energy use and economic growth are interconnected, both worldwide and specifically in Serbia. This theory has been validated by identifying a link between energy efficiency and economic expansion in Serbia, determining that the connection between energy use and economic expansion is causal and measurable, and by proving that such causality is also applicable to Serbia. Energy efficiency indicators, along with their fluctuation patterns in Serbia, have indicated that the rebound effect is relevant in this scenario and that energy use can serve as a substitute for energy efficiency when determining causality between efficiency and economic expansion. A thorough and methodical literature review through meta-analysis has pinpointed factors that result in varying conclusions in energy-growth nexus studies; these factors include differences in research methodology, as well as the stability of political institutions, economic framework, degree of economic growth and climate. The link between energy use and economic growth in Serbia is causal and multifaceted, contingent on the type of energy consumed. Findings align with Serbia being a transitioning economy, but also heavily influenced by its predominant services sector. Studies have revealed a significant energy-saving element when determining a causal link between total final energy consumption and gross domestic product. There is an evident need to contemplate new tools and policies to aid in enhancing energy efficiency. Energy use should be incorporated into any growth and development model. Comprehending the influence of energy use and energy efficiency on economic growth and development is crucial for formulating suitable economic, energy and environmental policies.
