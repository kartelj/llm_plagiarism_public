The research conducted for this dissertation on the effects of solar attacks has revealed that even the most sophisticated electric power system (EPS) protection systems are unable to adequately defend against severe solar storms. Factors such as the Earth's weakening magnetosphere, the 2003 Solar storm in South Africa (which shares a similar latitude with Serbia), the destabilization of Venezuela's EPS in 2019 by the United States, and Serbia's complex security situation, have all contributed to the urgency of developing a strategic restructuring plan for the Serbian Electric Power Company to enhance its resilience. The extensive floods in May 2014, which incapacitated the Thermal Power Plant (TPP) "Kolubara" and TPP "Nikola Tesla A" for a significant duration, further underscored the vulnerability of the Serbian EPS to natural disasters. A comprehensive analysis of EPS failures suggests that the model of having fewer major electrical energy (EE) producers is flawed, as the EE transmission system to consumers, particularly the saturation of high voltage transformers, can cripple the entire EPS for 12 to 16 months (as per Lloyd's report). In South Africa, certain EPS components only resumed operation after four years. The disruption of normal economic activity, coupled with widespread social unrest and chaos, are all part of a targeted strategy to undermine a state's security system and are increasingly being employed in hybrid warfare. A review of published papers from Serbia indicates that the Serbian EPS is modern and is transitioning from fewer TPPs to more renewable energy sources (RES) producers by 2030. Given Serbia's complex security situation in the Balkans, it is crucial that it does not expose any apparent weaknesses. This dissertation proposes a new "stand by" approach to establishing energy-independent communes (within the existing EPS) that will leverage the robust development of underutilized industrial energy. Only large manufacturing companies have the capacity to swiftly enhance their backup EE power supply systems, converting their thermal units into small thermal power plants and transforming a local distribution network into an independent virtual network with its own EE producers that will serve as the backbone of energy-independent local administrative units. A study on the shift in awareness among Serbian business leaders regarding the 2017 and 2018 solar storms (before and after widespread media coverage) highlighted the need for a new model to create energy-independent companies for the swift execution of the energy-independent communes concept. The model's operational mechanism relies on the senior managers of leading companies, their expertise and influential positions, along with memetics and crony capitalism. The model's effectiveness was validated by a hypothesis and a fourth survey conducted among senior management in Serbia. This dissertation also offers practical solutions for protection against solar proton events and highlights the lack of research on health issues caused by solar storms in Serbia.
