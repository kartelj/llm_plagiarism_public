This doctoral thesis primarily examines the application of contemporary financial theories in the daily operations of Serbian companies. The thesis will introduce concepts such as capital budgeting and its methods, cost of capital, debt strategy, and capital structures of Serbian companies. The empirical section of the paper will scrutinize the application of these financial theories, using a sample of 65 companies from 2013 to 2017. This empirical section is divided into two parts: 1) Analysis of feedback from 65 financial executives from 2013 to 2017 and 2) Analysis of solvency and profitability indicators from the sample companies, derived from key documents like Balance Sheet, Income Statement, Notes to the Financial Statements, and Annual Business Reports from 2013 to 2017. Factors that impact investment and financial decisions, such as company size, capital source, age and tenure of financial directors, etc., will also be discussed. Furthermore, the findings will be juxtaposed with pertinent international surveys and their outcomes.
