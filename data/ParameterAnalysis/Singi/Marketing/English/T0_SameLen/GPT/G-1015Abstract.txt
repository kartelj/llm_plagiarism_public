Wine, a distinctive product of Montenegro's agriculture, has a relatively low domestic consumption but a significant export share. The wine sector, with its unique grape and wine characteristics in certain regions, highlights the importance of this industry in the overall agricultural output and for a significant portion of the population. 

This study aims to investigate and scientifically validate strategies for enhancing the domestic marketing of this product. To achieve this, considerable efforts are needed to improve quality, promote sales channels, and undertake various other activities. Conversely, considering the current wine export performance and regional destinations, as well as the deficiencies in foreign market promotion, numerous measures are proposed to sustain and boost export levels, and by expanding the market, increase sales of high-quality wines. In this regard, we focus on exploring export opportunities to promising markets such as the USA, Canada, Japan, and China.

Wine production, a traditional agricultural sector, is expected to contribute to the agricultural and economic development of the country. Therefore, it is crucial to enhance all marketing activities that were previously overlooked in wine production and sales.
