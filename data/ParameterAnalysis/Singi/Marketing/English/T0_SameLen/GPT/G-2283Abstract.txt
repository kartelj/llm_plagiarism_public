This study aims to assess the competitiveness of Serbia's economy, the efficacy of its competitiveness policy, and the role of clusters in enhancing regional competitiveness. The hypotheses were tested using methodologies from the World Economic Forum, the Center for Strategy and Competitiveness, the University of Stockholm, and the European Cluster Observatory. The goal was to identify the relationship between the strength of clusters in regions, as measured by the location quotient, and GDPpc as a productivity indicator, in the following five countries (also known as G-5): Hungary, Bulgaria, Greece, Romania, and Serbia. The data for this study was collected from the Statistical Office of Serbia, EUROSTAT, the World Economic Forum, and the European Cluster Observatory. The findings indicate that Serbia's competitiveness indicators are declining, particularly in comparison to other countries at a similar development stage, and that its competitiveness policy measures are inadequate. In the G-5 countries, 13 out of 20 cluster categories analyzed showed a positive correlation between the strength of clusters in regions and regional competitiveness.
