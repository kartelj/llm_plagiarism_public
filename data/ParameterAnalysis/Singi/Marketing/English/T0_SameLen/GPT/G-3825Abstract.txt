Wine tourism, a specific interest tourism sector, has seen substantial global growth. It should play a key role in Serbia's tourism offerings, particularly considering Serbia's lack of mass tourism-friendly attractions, including wine regions. This study examines the global significance of wine tourism and its potential role in Serbia's tourism sector, focusing on the Vrsac region. The aim of this dissertation is to identify the potential and future of Serbian wine tourism through investigation, analysis, and comparison. During the research and analysis of wine tourism, a comparative analysis was performed on the relative importance of various aspects of wine tourism supply and marketing activities for visitors and wine tourists as one group, and winery managers as another. The methodology of this study involves identifying wine tourism traits, determining its unique features, defining the basic characteristics, analyzing Serbian wine tourism supply, examining the role of marketing in wine tourism development, comparing the attitudes of visitors/tourists and winery owners or managers towards the importance of specific aspects of supply and marketing activities, and finally identifying the strengths and weaknesses of Serbian wine tourism. After analyzing the research findings, the research objectives have been achieved, and it has been established what wine tourism is, its role in special interest tourism and specific tourism destinations' development, the role of strategic marketing and specific supply segments for the development and quality positioning of Serbian and Vrsac wine tourism on target markets, the effectiveness of specific marketing tools for development, promotion and positioning of Serbian and Vrsac wine tourism, the most effective marketing channels for communicating messages from Serbian and Vrsac wine tourism suppliers to target markets, and the key stakeholders in the development of Serbian and Vrsac wine tourism. One of the research conclusions is that wine tourism, although in its early stages, has significant potential to enhance Serbia's overall tourism offerings, and that winery owners and managers have not fully utilized marketing opportunities, which could be seen as a threat to the survival and development of this tourism sector, but also as an opportunity to achieve the desired market position through education and appropriate application of knowledge.
