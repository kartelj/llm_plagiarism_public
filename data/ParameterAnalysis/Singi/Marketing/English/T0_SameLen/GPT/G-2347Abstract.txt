'This dissertation examines the effects of water usage on Libyan agriculture and the resulting ecological indicators. Libya, a predominantly dry and arid nation, has the Sahara desert covering about 95% of its land. The majority of its arable and pasture lands are situated in the northern part of the narrow Mediterranean coastal line. Water resources are scarce due to the lack of surface water resources and other sources such as water desalination and wastewater treatment. Libya relies heavily on groundwater, which constitutes approximately 95% of its water supply. The country sits atop vast reserves of non-renewable groundwater, including the world's largest Nubian Sandstone aquifer system located under the southern part of the Libyan desert. The agricultural sector, which contributes about 9% to the GDP, consumes 85% of the total water supply and 12% of electricity. These indicators highlight mismanagement and unsustainable practices in the sector. Three ecological indicators were selected to assess the environmental impacts of water usage in agriculture: 1) Water consumption (drain) indicator; 2) Land use (drain) indicator; and 3) Water pollution indicator. According to these indicators, the environmental sustainability index is poor, primarily due to the high water consumption index in agriculture, especially in the densely populated northern region. This has led to serious environmental issues such as seawater intrusion into groundwater, water pollution, and soil salinization. Overuse of groundwater in the southern region has also led to a decline in the groundwater level in the upper layers, causing some desert lakes to dry up. To mitigate the damage caused by water usage in agriculture, a sustainable solution is proposed to address water depletion. Seawater is considered a renewable and sustainable water source. The idea is to exploit seawater for agricultural purposes in Libya's coastal deserts by using salt-tolerant plants (Halophytes), particularly those used for animal feed. This dissertation will present a study on how to use seawater as a renewable resource for water and agriculture in Libya and how this can contribute to sustainable development in this vast country. The most compelling reasons to exploit seawater include: 1. The lack of underground water inventory in coastal areas and its overlap with seawater in several areas. In contrast, Libya has the longest coastline on the Mediterranean, spanning more than 1,900 kilometers. 2. The fluctuating rainfall amount, which has negatively impacted natural grassland. 3. More than 90% of the country's population resides in coastal areas, leading to a significant drain of the already scarce groundwater in this region. To address this issue, the government has initiated the Great Man-Made River project, which delivers water from the south to the northern areas. 4. The need to conserve groundwater and surface water inventories, as they are non-renewable water sources. A sustainable approach is suggested to generate energy from the Great Man-Made River (GMR) by harnessing the water movement across the GMR pipeline using appropriately sized turbines. The GMR pipeline, which is about 4,000 km long and 4 meters in diameter, can generate hundreds of kilowatts of clean energy from a single turbine due to its high water flow rate. The reasons to exploit the GMR for energy generation include: 1) The need for a sustainable environmental energy source; 2) The Power System uses the energy of flowing water to provide a consistent, controllable, non-weather-dependent source of electricity, unlike other types of renewable energy that are weather-dependent. A sustainable approach is also suggested to use the GMR for food production. The GMR could be converted from supplying freshwater to coastal cities into a large agricultural project after establishing several seawater desalination plants (solar-powered) to meet the cities' freshwater needs. This would make it possible to convert thousands of desert hectares around the pipelines into a large agricultural project irrigated from the GMR. The transition from reliance on fossil fuels to renewable energy sources for power generation is crucial, as agricultural expansion means increased consumption of underground water and fuel, leading to greater environmental pollution. Solar energy is a promising renewable energy source in Libya, but this dissertation also explores other sustainable, clean, and environmentally friendly energy sources. This diversification of renewable energy sources enhances economic and environmental security. This dissertation focuses on generating power from: 1) The movement of water across the GMR pipe; 2) The movement of vehicles on roads, known as Smart Roads. These techniques are considered a wise policy and increase the variety of sustainable energy sources. This step is in the right direction towards exploiting new technologies to obtain clean, renewable, and sustainable energy.'
