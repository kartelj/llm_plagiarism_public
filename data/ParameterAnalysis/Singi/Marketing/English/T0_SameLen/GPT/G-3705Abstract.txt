The worldwide crisis has directly affected all transitioning nations, including ours, leading to consequences like reduced investments, foreign investor withdrawal, and debt increase. Despite the rise in non-performing loans, Bosnia and Herzegovina's banking sector has largely withstood the economic crisis's severe effects, partly due to its conservative policy, negating the need for risk-taking as the current business model is profitable. Additionally, a review of Bosnia and Herzegovina's stock exchange operations during the observed period, from inception, growth, to turnover decline, has been conducted. This decline is not solely due to the economic crisis but also internal factors. The banking sector, largely privatised and dominated by foreign private capital, is the financial system's most crucial component, with deposits being the primary business operation source and loans being the fundamental product. Since loans have been the prevalent fund placement form and play a significant role in overall banking operations, credit risk poses a cash flow and bank liquidity problem, partially addressed in the thesis. To maintain a quality loan portfolio, bank management establishes a clear loan policy that optimises profitability within the bank's acceptable risk parameters. The thesis examines non-performing loan trends in Republika Srpska, based on the Banking Agency of Republika Srpska's 2009 â€“ 2016 reports. The study aimed to test econometric theory, provide empirical results, and predict future values. Given Bosnia and Herzegovina's business operation conditions (undeveloped capital markets, inadequate collateral realisation and collection regulations, and credit operations' dominance in overall banking operations), the most attention in banking sector operation control is given to credit risk, liquidity risk, and foreign exchange risk control. Due to the absence of a market for most asset items, sophisticated market evaluations are not yet applicable. Foreign investors' interest in the region's banking market emerged in the early 2000s. Factors that attracted foreign investors to the region's banking sector included developed financial and credit markets, gross domestic product level, low inflation rate, economic growth, and productivity. The pursuit of returns played a crucial role in foreign investors' decision to enter these markets, leading to dominance and increased competitiveness. German, Austrian, Italian, and French banks showed the most interest in these markets. The arrival of foreign banks in the region's banking sector brought expected benefits like new technology and innovation introduction, competitiveness and infrastructure enhancement, and foreign investor arrival. Banks with majority foreign capital performed better than local banks due to superior service.
