The technological framework and intensity of factors in Serbia's merchandise export saw improvements between 2000-2014. However, these changes did not significantly enhance the structure of domestic exports, thus failing to establish a robust, sustainable long-term growth environment. The quality of Serbian merchandise exports, gauged by the proportion of higher-level processed goods, significantly trails behind EU countries and, to a lesser degree, transitioning Central European economies. 

This paper examines the quantitative shifts in the technological framework and factor intensity of domestic merchandise exports, focusing on the trend changes in the shares of skill-intensive manufacturing and high to 'medium-high' technology products in total exports from 2000-2014. The transfer of modern technology and investments, particularly through FDI, into competitive sectors is crucial to diversify the export offer. A reformed approach to employment policy regulations and a comprehensive overhaul of the science and education system are required. A focused industrial policy and strategies at the sector and firm level are needed to propel a shift towards technology-intensive activities with higher spill-over effects. 

Export-led growth, vital for Serbia, necessitates an expansion of foreign trade. The institutional framework conditions for this expansion are already in place (the EU's Stabilization and Association Agreement with Serbia and CEFTA). It is important for Serbia that the demand for imports in the euro area is expected to moderately increase in 2015 and 2016, despite constraints due to subdued total euro area demand and some downward impact from the recent depreciation of the euro. 

This research highlights the importance of external environmental factors and competitiveness strategies, and their correlation with the identified critical competitiveness indicators of small and medium-sized enterprises in transition economies. By adapting to the environment and removing key obstacles through the implementation of suitable competitive strategies, the strategic positioning of small and medium-sized enterprises in the transitional context can be improved, enhancing their competitiveness. 

Serbia requires a new concept of systemic competitiveness, which encompasses both political and economic determinants of successful industrial development. This concept refers to a pattern where state and social actors consciously create conditions for successful industrial development. It differentiates between four levels: the microlevel of the firm and inter-firm networks, the mesolevel of specific policies and institutions, the macrolevel of generic economic conditions, and the metalevel of slow variables like socio-cultural structures, the basic order and orientation of the economy, and the capacity of social actors to formulate strategies.
