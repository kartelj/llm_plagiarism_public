Examining the practical and theoretical issues surrounding the concept of motivation, the question arises whether it is enough for organizations to solely concentrate on managing motivation through monetary incentives and external factors to enhance performance and employee satisfaction. The starting point of this dissertation is the self-determination theory, which suggests the existence of various forms of motivation, each differing in their degree of self-determination. According to its principles, different types of motivation are organized along a motivation continuum. At one end of the spectrum is the most autonomous or self-determined form of motivation - intrinsic motivation. At the other end is amotivation, or the absence of motivation. Various types of extrinsic motivation, differing in their degree of autonomy and self-determination, are found between these two extremes. This dissertation presents the application of the main principles of the self-determination theory to a group of employees in the hospitality industry in the Republic of Serbia, with the goal of promoting motivational techniques and methods. The author investigates the extent to which social environmental factors such as work climate and job type influence the structure of motivation (autonomous/regulated/amotivation), and how that motivation affects job satisfaction and individual wellbeing. The study was carried out on a group of employees in 4 and 5-star hotels in Belgrade. The gathered data was analyzed using the statistical program SPSS, version 23. Descriptive analysis (mean, standard deviation), Cronbach Alpha Coefficient for determining the reliability of the scales used on the sample, and statistical conclusion were used for data analysis. The Pearson correlation coefficient, T-test, and analysis of variances were used to test relationships and differences based on measured characteristics. The research carried out in this dissertation validates the application of the principles of the self-determination theory in a work context.
