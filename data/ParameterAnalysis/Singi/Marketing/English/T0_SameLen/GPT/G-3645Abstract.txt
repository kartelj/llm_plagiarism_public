Over recent decades, cruise tourism, a subset of nautical tourism, has seen rapid growth. A geographical analysis of cruise destinations reveals its global development. While it undoubtedly fosters unity, mutual understanding, and financial benefits, cruise tourism also has negative impacts. Hence, strategic management of this sector, particularly in line with sustainable development, is crucial. This study examines the current state of cruise tourism in Kotor municipality, highlighting its potential, pros and cons, strategic growth, and international competitiveness. The author focuses on how cruise tourism enhances the town's offerings and its positive economic impact. A survey was conducted to gauge the economic sector and Kotor's population's views on cruise tourism's role and significance. The findings suggest that cruise tourism is seen as a vital component of Kotor's tourism, potentially positioning Montenegro as a globally renowned tourist destination. However, participants felt that cruise tourism is underdeveloped and acknowledged the need to stimulate this sector's growth. The primary positive outcomes identified were local revenue increase and job creation. The key socio-cultural benefits include exposure to new cultures and showcasing local traditions. The most significant negative impact is the degradation of natural resources. Participants felt that the government bears the most responsibility for maximizing benefits and minimizing drawbacks of cruise tourism, necessitating stronger legislative regulations. Emphasizing the importance of cruise tourism education and enhancing dialogue among key stakeholders to cater to local community needs is of utmost importance.
