This document provides a comprehensive review of pertinent sources from both traditional and modern literature in the areas of Communication, Organizational Science, Social Psychology (Values), and Change Management. The literature review is followed by a critical examination of individual research shortcomings, content analysis, and a comparison of similar surveys conducted on specific respondents. The research findings for this dissertation, conducted on a suitable sample across multiple countries to enhance relevance and purpose, are then presented in detail. The survey sample consisted of 342 employees, with 200 respondents from 5 regional countries and 10 western hemisphere countries completing an online survey, while the remaining respondents received the questionnaire through personal contacts. The field research results were compared with published research from both domestic and international literature, with an analysis of similarities and differences conducted. The document seeks to establish whether there are statistically derived indicators showing a correlation between an organization's external communication (i.e., the organization's communication with its public) and the socio-personal values of its employees. A factor analysis of the sample revealed six indicators of an organization's external communication. As correlations and other statistical methods demonstrated a correlation between the organization's external communication indicators and the socio-personal values of its employees, the primary research hypothesis has been confirmed. Contemporary research, particularly in domestic literature, lacks a systematic exploration of external communication as a form of organizational behavior. Specifically, there is a lack of research involving an organization's external communication in relation to the values, desires, needs, motivation, and corporate identity of its employees. The specificity of an organization's external communication within our social frameworks, which is often conducted impulsively and within the current budget rather than strategically planned, warrants further research attention. It is frequently subject to a non-systematic approach dependent on a specific company department and employees primarily involved in marketing activities and press release issuance. The research also found a correlation between the (un)successful external communication of an organization and employee work motivation, with a positive correlation indicating that more efficient and successful external communication motivates employees to work harder. Conversely, employee attitudes towards inevitable changes in progressive organizations suggest a significant difference in value priorities between employees who accept and participate in changes and those who resist them. Such results, often explained by various authors as "internal motivation", already exist in previous research. Employees less fearful of change and with a more positive attitude towards it are more easily self-motivated and often become active participants in, and even drivers of, organizational change. These employees typically value family, personal happiness, education, financial independence, general independence, and work commitment. Given the new scientific information provided by the dissertation, the discussion and final conclusions propose ways to better implement the research findings in organizational systems and their internal and external communication channels.
