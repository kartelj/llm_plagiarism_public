The competitiveness of tourism, and therefore of tourist destinations, has become a crucial research topic for both the scientific community and tourist destinations. Current market trends shape the evolution of tourist destinations, which must provide quality experiences to distinguish themselves from competitors. To become more appealing and secure a stronger competitive stance, destinations must create quality experiences. The task of destination management is to efficiently and effectively utilize all available destination resources, adhering to sustainability principles, and to formulate clear and effective strategies for destination product development to enhance the tourist experience. To improve the competitive position of tourism destinations, it is vital to consistently assess the competitiveness of a tourist destination using various evaluation techniques, whether they measure past, present, or future competitiveness. In contemporary tourism, competitiveness measurement becomes the foundation for destination product development. Measurement yields specific results that determine a tourist destination's position relative to a defined competitive set. These results form the basis for guiding development and addressing the deficiencies of the current competitive position. As a first step in determining the competitiveness of tourist destinations, competitiveness indicators are ranked to create a framework and offer guidance for future tourism development and destination competitiveness positioning. The research thesis proposes that continuous competitiveness measurement becomes an essential component of the tourist destination management process. This dissertation focuses on tourist destination competitiveness and competitiveness measurement indicators, with a particular emphasis on Serbia as a tourist destination. This work lays the groundwork for developing a model that could be used for ongoing competitiveness measurement of Serbian tourism in the future. Consequently, the adapted integrated model of destination competitiveness proposed here is used to measure Serbia's competitiveness as a tourist destination. Conclusions highlight the factors and indicators of competitiveness that Serbia should prioritize in future development. The results reveal the strengths and weaknesses of Serbia's competitive position as a tourist destination.
