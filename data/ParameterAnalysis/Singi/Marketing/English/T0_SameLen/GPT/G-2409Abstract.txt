The process of decision making always includes a risk component among other factors. Insurance firms base their operations on a risk model. These firms have developed numerous actuarial techniques and models to balance income and expenses, meet profit targets, and maintain solvency simultaneously. The business transactions of insurance companies are a vital part of every national economy. To minimize risks and ensure the security and stability of financial flows, a country sets up rules and procedures to define the legal framework of their business activities. Insurance companies establish various reserves to maintain solvency. Technical reserves are utilized to cover future insurance contract liabilities. These reserves are the basis for balancing anticipated risks (damages, insured amounts, and compensations). Insurance companies gather additional capital funds (guarantee reserves) to cover unexpected risks - catastrophic events and unforeseen business losses. As institutional investors, insurance companies invest reserve funds in the financial market. The main market risk management during the investment process involves aligning assets and liabilities as a basis for maintaining long-term solvency. The business operations of insurance companies are also affected by many other risks - strategic, operational, credit, legal, etc. Identifying, classifying, and monitoring risks requires extensive knowledge of methodology and risk management specifics in insurance companies. Research findings indicate that applying risk management in practice is key to improving business performance.
