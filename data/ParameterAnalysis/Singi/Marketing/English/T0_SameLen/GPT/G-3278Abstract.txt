A trend is emerging in cruise tourism, with cruise companies placing greater emphasis on the quality of the cruise experience. This is because the quality of the cruise experience significantly influences tourist satisfaction and future behavior. Recognizing the importance of this, this dissertation will explore the nature of the cruise experience, including its antecedents and consequences. The research problem involves gaining a deeper understanding of the cruise experience and developing a methodological tool to measure its antecedents and consequences. The author of this dissertation has chosen a holistic approach to test the service theater model (cruise ship performance) and service quality (quality dimensions). These elements can then be used to successfully design a quality cruise experience. The research is grounded in the following research philosophies: postmodernism, postpositivism, and interpretivism, and employs suitable quantitative and qualitative data collection methods. Consistent with these philosophies, the research approach combines induction and deduction. Structural equation modeling was used to test the conceptual model. The findings confirmed that employees, guests, service setting, and service quality are the antecedents of the cruise experience. However, only experienced emotion positively influenced overall satisfaction and future behavior. The nature of the cruise experience is a relatively unexplored topic in academia. Therefore, this study contributes to the ontology of the quality of the cruise experience and the development of its theory. The research was conducted on a cruise ship with guest participation, ensuring that all aspects of practical application were considered. Consequently, the research results hold managerial significance due to the data collected, research findings, insights, and practical recommendations.
