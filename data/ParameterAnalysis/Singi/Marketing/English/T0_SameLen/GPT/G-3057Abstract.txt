The enhancement of cultural assets in Kosovo and Metohija to boost tourism offerings is a crucial issue for the future recognition of the Autonomous Province of Kosovo and Metohija (AP KiM) as a significant tourist destination. Kosovo and Metohija is a region rich in culture, tradition, and the cultural heritage of all ethnic groups residing there. Their shared existence has led to the blending of cultural influences and the destruction of other cultures' marks during conflicts, regardless of their cultural and historical significance to civilization. At the time of writing this dissertation, it is stressed that a modern multicultural, multi-confessional, and multi-lingual society can only be established through active preservation of cultural diversity. The enhancement of cultural and historical heritage in the former Yugoslavia, where Kosovo was located, was based on cultural values defined by laws and regulations within a specific time frame. The economic enhancement of cultural and historical heritage and goods was often overlooked. In recent decades, the situation has shifted in the culture sector, which now receives a portion of the budget over other social sectors. Culture should also become a profit source, as cultural tourism has already been identified as such in some countries. To preserve the rich heritage of all ethnic groups in KiM and the Republic of Serbia, it is essential to implement and innovate the process of enhancing cultural values to boost tourism. The enhancement of historical heritage to strengthen tourism should adhere to global criteria, which outline its protection and preservation process and contribute to economic development and reconciliation.
