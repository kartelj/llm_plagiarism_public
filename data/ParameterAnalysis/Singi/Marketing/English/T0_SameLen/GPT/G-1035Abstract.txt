This paper's objective is to assess the impact of various balance sheet and off-balance sheet factors on the interest rate risk exposure of banks in developed and emerging financial markets. The evaluation of this exposure aids in the identification, tracking, and management of interest rate risk. We examined 65 bank holding companies in the United States as a representative of a developed financial market, while the emerging financial market sample comprised 10 banks from the Republic of Serbia, listed on the Belgrade Stock Exchange. A comparative study of the balance sheet attributes' influence was carried out based on Stone's regression model and the econometric panel model results. The application of these models supports the argument that factors like bank size and the proportion of deposits in total assets have a statistically significant but contrasting effect on banks in developed and emerging financial markets. The growth of total assets in U.S. banks heightens their exposure to interest rate risk, whereas in Serbia, the effect is reversed. Similarly, a rise in the proportion of deposits in total assets of U.S. banks lessens their exposure to interest rate risk, but Serbian banks experience a contrasting effect. There are statistically significant factors with similar effects, for instance, an increase in return on average equity (ROAE) and a decrease in net interest income impact the reduction of banks' exposure to interest rate risk, irrespective of the market's development level where the banks operate.
