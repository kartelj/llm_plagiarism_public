In  the modern  tourist market,  the  constant  and  daily  changes  in  tourism  demand   are evident, dictated by tourists as very demanding customers. There is hardly a tourist   destination  in  the  world  that  has  certain  attractions  that  attract  tourists  and  direct  the   demand for travel on local, regional, national and international level as well.   This is one of the reasons why tourist destinations increasingly compete with one   another,  creating  a  competitive  advantage  with  a  quality  offering  compared  to  similar   destinations  in  the  region.  This  is  why  it  is  necessary  to  assess  and  analyze  the   situation  in  Vojvodina  tourism  as  a  tourist  destination  but  also  the  attitudes  of   employees in tourist companies in both government- and private sector, in order to draw   conclusions  that  can  contribute  to  achieving  a  competitive  advantage  of  Vojvodina   compared to similar destinations in the surroundings.   By  applying  the  value  chain  as  the  strategy  for  competitive  advantage  we  have   come  to  certain  results  that  indicate  the  possibilities  and  directions  of  future   development of tourism in Vojvodina.
