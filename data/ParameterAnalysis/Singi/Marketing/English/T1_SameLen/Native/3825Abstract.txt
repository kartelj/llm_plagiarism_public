Wine tourism is a type of special interest tourism that has shown significant growth at the global level. As such it should have a prominent role in tourism supply of Serbia, especially if we take into account that Serbia lacks tourist attractions suitable for mass tourism development, which encompasses wine regions as well. This paper explores the importance of wine tourism on the global tourism market, as well as its role in tourism supply of Serbia, with special emphasis on the example of Vrsac region. The goal of this thesis is to determine the opportunities and prospects for development of wine tourism in Serbia through research, analysis and comparison. In the course of the analysis and research into wine tourism, comparative analysis was conducted on the respective importance of the particular aspects of wine tourism supply and marketing activities for visitors and wine tourists as one distinct group and winery managers as another group. The methodology of this approach includes the identification of wine tourism characteristics, determining its specific features, defining the basic features as well as the analysis of wine tourism supply in Serbia, the analysis of the role of marketing in the development of wine tourism, comparative analysis of the attitude of visitors/ tourists and winery owners or managers towards the importance of particular aspects of the supply and marketing activities and finally determining the advantages and disadvantages of Serbian wine tourism. After the analysis of the research results the goals of the research have been met and it has been determined what wine tourism is, its role in special interest tourism and particular tourism destinations` development, the role of strategic marketing and particular segments of supply for the development and quality positioning of wine tourism supply of Serbia and Vrsac on target markets, the efficiency of particular marketing tools for development, promotion and positioning of wine tourism of Serbia and Vrsac, the most efficient marketing channels for communicating messages from the suppliers of wine tourism in Serbia and Vrsac to target markets while the most important stakeholders in the development process of wine tourism in Serbia and Vrsac were also defined. One of the conclusions of the research is that wine tourism, although it is in the beginning phase, has significant potential in enhancing the overall tourism supply of Serbia and that marketing opportunities have not been sufficiently used by winery owners and managers, which may be regarded as a threat to survival and development of this type of tourism, but on the other hand it represents the opportunity to achieve the desired position on the market through the process of education and suitable application of the knowledge.
