Economic Development and Energy Efficiency: Modelling the Relationship and Meta-Analysis Energy efficiency, energy consumption and economic development are interrelated, both globally and in Serbia. This hypothesis has been confirmed by ascertaining a relation between energy efficiency and economic growth in Serbia, establishing that the relationship between energy consumption and economic growth is causal and can be quantified, and by demonstrating that such causality is also valid for Serbia. Indicators of energy efficiency, as well as dynamics of their variability in Serbia have pointed out that the rebound effect applies to this case and that it is possible to use energy consumption as a proxy for energy efficiency when establishing causality between efficiency and economic growth. A comprehensive and systematic literature review using meta-analysis has identified factors that lead to different conclusions in research of energy-growth nexus; they include distinctions in research design, as well as stability of political institutions, economic structure, level of economic development and climate. Relationship between energy consumption and economic growth in Serbia is causal and multidimensional, dependent on the type of energy used. Results are consistent with the fact Serbia is a transition economy, but also strongly influenced by its dominant services sector. Research has shown a strong energy-saving component when establishing a causal relationship between total final consumption of energy and gross domestic product. There is a clear necessity to consider new instruments and policies to support improvement of energy efficiency. Energy consumption ought to be a part of any growth and development model. Understanding the impact of energy consumption and energy efficiency on economic growth and development is paramount for establishing appropriate economic, energy and environmental policies.
