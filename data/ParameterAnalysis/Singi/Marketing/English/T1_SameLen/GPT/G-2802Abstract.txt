The doctoral dissertation focuses on the role sustainability plays in current destination governance practices for alpine and dinaric mountain destinations. Initially, it juxtaposes the integration of sustainability in destination governance by the destination management organizations (DMO) in the Alps and the Dinarides. Quantitative data was gathered via a survey and utilized to examine the disparities in the two regions concerning the adoption of sustainability principles in destination planning, leadership/management styles in destination governance, destination development priorities, as well as the weight given to individual stakeholders. Subsequently, comparisons are drawn between the two most advanced mountain destinations in Serbia, Kopaonik and Zlatibor, employing the comprehensive framework for indicators of sustainable tourism. In doing so, gaps were pinpointed, and proposals were put forth for advancements in both destinations. Lastly, interviews were carried out to delve deeper into available strategies and tools for executing sustainable tourism in the German Alps, which could serve as a model for the development of mountain tourism in the Dinaric region. The interviewees were asked about various aspects including: strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats in the destination, sustainability, project initiatives and plans related to sustainability, key stakeholders involved in sustainable tourism, safeguarding natural resources, indicators of sustainable development and cross-border collaboration. During these discussions, ecotourism spontaneously arose as a salient topic.
