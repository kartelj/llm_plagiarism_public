This paper's objective is to assess the impact of various balance sheet and off-balance sheet factors on the interest rate risk exposure of banks in developed and emerging financial markets. The evaluation of such exposure aids in identifying, monitoring and managing interest rate risks. We examined 65 US bank holding companies representing a developed market, while 10 Serbian banks listed on the Belgrade Stock Exchange represented an emerging market. A comparative study of balance sheet influences was carried out using Stone's regression model and the econometric panel model. The outcomes of these models corroborate the hypothesis that factors like bank size and deposit proportions in total assets have a significant yet contrasting effect on banks in developed and emerging markets. For instance, an increase in total assets escalates interest rate risk exposure in US banks, the opposite occurs in Serbia. Similarly, a rise in deposit proportions reduces interest rate risk exposure in US banks; Serbian banks experience a contrasting impact. Some statistically significant factors result in similar impacts; for example, an increase in Return on Average Equity (ROAE) and a decrease in net interest income reduce banks' exposure to interest rate risk, irrespective of the market's development.
