Contemporary businesses conditions significantly impact modern retail, with demand increase and resulting revenue growth requiring a company's quick and accurate response to ongoing market challenges to maintain expansion. The current rapid retail model suggests inventory shortages aren't a problem, as late deliveries cause lost sales, customer dissatisfaction, and subsequent competitive advantage issues. This article aimed to explore how demand forecasting affects inventory management, and to establish a universal demand forecasting and inventory management methodology. It was within this context that almost all inventory management determinants were scientifically and theoretically systemised. A thorough analysis of multi-criteria demand management's influence on stock management processes identifies key determinants when studying demand forecasting efficiency. The main research aim was to pinpoint modern business conditions' demand specifics, and to show the efficient use of forecast methodology as a significant stock management portion. A company whose operations aren't rooted in the demand prediction process, an inventory management factor, can't sustain this in the long-term. The research used retail data from Winwin Shop Čačak, forecasting demand for 4 product categories across over 100 stores, representing more than 40% of total sales. The study showed forecasting demand is crucial for improving retail operations efficiency in today's business environment. The multi-criteria method, the Analytical hierarchical process, provided the mathematical base for the research, while the Expert Choice software helped estimate and predict the products' future demand under investigation. The results reaffirm the importance of forecasting demand in inventory optimisation, enhancing company operational efficiency. However, subjectivity's influence on the demand prediction process can be minimised, but not entirely eliminated.
