This doctoral thesis primarily examines the utilization of contemporary financial theories in the daily operations of Serbian companies. The thesis will encompass concepts such as capital budgeting techniques, cost of capital, debt strategies, and capital structures prevalent in Serbian businesses. An empirical investigation of these theories' application will be undertaken within the paper, by exploring a sample consisting of 65 companies from the time frame of 2013 to 2017. The empirical segment of the thesis is bifurcated into two parts: 1) Review of the feedback from 65 finance heads during 2013 to 2017, and 2) Examination of liquidity and profitability indicators obtained from pertinent documents such as Balance Sheets, Profit & Loss Statements, Disclosures in Financial Statements, and Annual Business Reports during 2013 to 2017. Factors contributing to investment and financial choices like the company's size, origin of capital, and tenure of finance heads etc. will also be discussed. Furthermore, the findings will be weighed against related international research and its outcomes.
