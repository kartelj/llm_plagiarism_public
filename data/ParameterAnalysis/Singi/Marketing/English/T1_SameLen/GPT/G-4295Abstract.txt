Serbia, being the majority participant in the EU accession process, has established a system and revamped its national technical legislation to align with EU laws. The nation shows commendable adherence to chief EU directives concerning waste management. Applicability and execution, however, remain in the early stages, with moderate advancement in utility waste collection and landfill waste sanitation. The state has primary duty over waste management, the main objective being waste reduction to minimize environmental pollution and its utilization as a resource. EU environmental protection laws are extensive and well-defined, yet provide flexibility for Member States to modify implementation approaches in line with their institutions and constitutions. Serbia's existing infrastructure for hazardous waste treatment is ill-prepared to comply with the EU's New and Global approach directives. The evolution and adaptation of methods, new technologies development, plant construction for new technology application in handling specialized hazardous waste, and professional training are prolonged and costly processes. Therefore, a national-scale mobilization of all resources is necessary to facilitate the alignment and enforcement of environmental and waste management laws. This will benefit human health and economic growth while fulfilling the needs of both present and future generations. In Serbia, the hazardous waste management system demonstrates a complete lack of any hazardous waste treatment and location. Consequently, this publication was constructed to propose a disposal and complete eradication solution for hazardous waste presently a significant issue in numerous Serbian enterprises. This facility's hazardous waste treatment will predominantly focus on disposing of PCB oil, Ni-Cd batteries, biodegradable waste, etc. This document also outlines the current situation of hazardous waste and the accompanying legal provisions, offers a methodological process on how plasma technology can achieve total waste disposal and energy transformation into heat and electricity and introduces an efficient consumption business model.
