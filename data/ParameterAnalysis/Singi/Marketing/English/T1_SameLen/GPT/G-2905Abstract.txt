In today's conditions, connecting public and private sectors has become crucial for societal advancement. This thesis is focused on researching the evolution of the regulatory system regarding public-private partnerships (PPP) and concessions in Serbia, dating back to 1990. The growth of public participation in the private sector started in the 1970s and 1980s, mainly in the most advanced economies, through public infrastructure schemes. In Serbia, concessions aren't novel to national economic and legal practices. However, it was only in 2011 that the public-private partnership was incorporated into the Serbian legal framework through the Law on Public-Private Partnership and Concessions. Prior to this, the field was governed on a national level by the Law on Concessions, and at the local level, infrastructure investments from the private sector were regulated by the Public Utility Law. The increasingly intricate relationship between the public and private sectors necessitates continuous institutional engagement, by crafting new codes and regulations to meet market needs. This will form the core argument of this research. This study's objective is to underscore the significance of the regulatory structure in facilitating investments through PPP and concessions. By utilizing a historical analysis and examples presented in the dissertation, the aim is to indicate the pros and cons of regulatory frameworks revealed through their enactment and draw attention to this matter's importance in shaping future regulatory framework development.
