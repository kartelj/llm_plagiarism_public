This document provides a comprehensive overview of pertinent publications from both classical and modern literature within the realms of Communication, Organizational Science, Social Psychology (Values), and Change Management. It is supplemented with a critical analysis of individual research limitations, the scrutiny of content, and the comparison of similarly conducted studies on selected respondents. After thoroughly presenting and examining the content, the research outcomes meant for this thesis are presented. These were collected from a fitting sample across multiple countries, to ensure the relevance and purposefulness of the results. This survey included 342 participants, 200 of which completed an online questionnaire across 5 regional countries and 10 Western hemisphere countries. The remaining participants received the questionnaire through personal contacts. The field research findings were contrasted with previously published studies both domestically and internationally. A comparison of similarities and differences was performed. The goal of this document is to substantiate the existence of statistically formulated indicators that express a correlation between an organization's outward communication (the organization's communication with the public) and the employees' socio-personal values. Through a factor analysis of the sample, six indicators of an organization's external communication were identified. Correlations and statistical methods confirmed a relationship between these indicators and the employees' socio-personal values, thus proving the central hypothesis: there is a statistical correlation between a company's external communication and its employees' socio-personal values. Contemporary research and domestic literature lack a systematic examination of external communication as a form of organizational behavior. This document seeks to rectify this; to actively explore how external communication in relation to employee values, needs, desires, motivations, and corporate identity. The specific attributes and impacts of external communication within our social contexts demand research attention, considering it is often implemented impulsively with existing budgets, rather than strategically. It often falls under the domineering department, likely marketing, and specific employees who predominantly manage publicity. Furthermore, the research demonstrated a correlation between the successfulness of external communication and employee motivation. This correlation is positive, indicating that effective and successful external communication fosters enhanced employee motivation. Alternatively, employee attitudes towards organizational change, which is typically obligatory for improvements, indicate substantial differences in value priorities among employees who embrace change versus those who resist it. These findings resonate with prior research, with the resistance often attributed to internal motivation. Employees who fear change less and possess a positive outlook are typically more self-motivated, proactive participants in the change process, and commonly agents of change themselves. They frequently value family highly, cherish personal happiness, are highly educated, have a strong desire for financial and general independence, and demonstrate a work ethic. As this dissertation contributes new scientific knowledge, the discussion and conclusions propose ways to more effectively implement these research findings within organizational systems and their internal and external communication channels.
