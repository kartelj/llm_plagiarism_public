Due to the unique circumstances confronting the Serbian banking sector between 2008 and 2016, liquidity has ceased to be a manageable category. This research investigates the obstacles faced by management structures at domestic commercial banks in volatile markets, as well as their response to situations of no/low liquidity, in relation to the established FTP system. In a banking sector like Serbia's, which lacks developed hedging mechanisms, a key question concerned the strong link between the FTP system and financial instrument development, and the evolution of Asset and Liability Management (ALM) concepts. Beyond this, the analyzed period raised questions about the uniform use of the FTP system in banks in light of liquidity, remembering 2008 and 2016, substantial liquidity, as well as the adoption and impacts of "best practices" and new principles known as Basel III. Comparative studies of two commercial banks operating in Serbia during the banking sector's liquidity crisis at the end of 2008 revealed high susceptibility to systemic and unique factors, constraints on liquid financing sources, and underdeveloped domestic markets that confront crises by escalating funding costs and exacerbating balance maturity disparities, particularly in Bank B's case. Bank A demonstrations show the same susceptibility to systemic risks derived from industry insolvency, and that short-term financing to mitigate the liquidity crisis was insufficient, considering that Bank B's maturity mismatch deepened four years later. Both Bank A and Bank B have had to deal with a dry interbank market, substantial deposit outflow sources, rising interest rates, and low liquidity ratio regulatory levels. Consequently, Bank A altered its structure by issuing shares, while Bank B resorted to borrowing short-term funds at "higher" prices than the market rate, postponing its liquidity issue until the following year. The first hypothesis that commercial banks utilize modern liquidity risk management concepts was dismissed following an empirical evaluation of the banking sector. This is primarily due to commercial banks' reliance on regulatory requirements to manage liquidity risk. The second hypothesis was also rejected as the FTP system was found to be vulnerable to liquidity circumstances and the banking sector's illiquidity. The third hypothesis has been confirmed through empirical analysis demonstrating a connection and the roles of ALM in commercial banks, which are directly related to the FTP system.
