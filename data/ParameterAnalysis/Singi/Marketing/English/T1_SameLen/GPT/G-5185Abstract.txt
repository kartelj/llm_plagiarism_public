From the perspective of process optimization and cost reduction, business enhancement is a common objective for every business system. Previous improvements focused on utilizing advanced technologies, mainly addressing specific business areas such as equipment maintenance via work orders and troubleshooting result analysis. However, they ignored the full process, from defect notification to defect elimination. Hence, the suggested solutions were only partial, leading to incorrect analysis outcomes in some instances. The recommended solution depends on mapping the entire process, selecting the best standard for documentation, examination, and optimization of the process, and selecting the suitable data format that can be matched with the analyzed process and the identified objects recorded during the process. Consequently, the solution deployed the suitable standard for that type of process, achieved through multi-criteria analysis, and a study of available professional literature. It also utilized a data warehouse for a common data structure, and with further analysis, an object process data warehouse was adopted with set analysis parameters and defined parameter limits. Analysis results indicated that the chosen process recording standard provided essential optimization elements, and the election of an object process data warehouse offered a reliable and realistic database. The transformation of data from a relational structure to a data warehouse structure resulted in a simple structure that allowed dynamic data access and grouping, and additional extensions related to threshold and target values validated the implemented concept. This concept revealed that while the maintenance system appeared highly successful (>95% equipment uptime), considering only the work order, there were delays in troubleshooting in over 30% of interventions, considering the complete process.
