This thesis seeks to explore the potential of utilizing the ARIMA model for predicting crude oil prices, and similarly, for managing market risks in oil firms employing the VaR methodology, alongside its application in an intricate managerial system of companies operating in the crude oil production, processing, and distribution industry. The mission of any firm, including oil companies, revolves around maximizing profits, reaching set goals continually, or achieving consistent gains notwithstanding the time and current business atmosphere. Concurrently maintaining market risk within tolerable levels forms a crucial task that necessitates management to timely implement amendments to minimize risks while maximizing resource funding, whilst taking into consideration quantities, timelines, and costs. The outcomes endorse the assertion that oil firms need to deploy suitable models for predicting oil price movements and managing commercial risks pertaining to crude oil to keep market risk within reasonable standards for making decisive future business choices amidst unstable eras. Future research will incorporate the application of other existing and novel models, methods, and their amalgamation, stress testing for forecasting crude oil prices and managing market risks for companies in the production, processing, and distribution sectors of crude oil. To ensure uninterrupted supply and maintaining mandatory crude oil reserves at the requisite level, future studies will include country risk and energy security as a prerequisite for the functioning of the economy and all its stakeholders, as well as potential consumers of this finite resource.
