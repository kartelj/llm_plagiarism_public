Promotion of cultural treasures within Kosovo and Metohija to bolster the tourism sector is a significant concern for the future recognition of the Autonomous Province of Kosovo and Metohija (AP KiM) as a key tourism destination. This area is rich in culture and tradition, serving as home to diverse ethnic communities with their distinct cultural heritages. The intermingling of these cultures has led to a rich tapestry of cultural influences, but also the unfortunate destruction of cultural markers during conflicts, regardless of their historic and civilizational value. As of writing this dissertation, it is stressed that a modern, multicultural, multi confessional, and multilingual society can only develop with active preservation of cultural variety. The valuation of cultural heritage across the territory of the former Yugoslavia, which included Kosovo, was historically based on cultural values defined by governing laws and regulations within the specific period. However, the economic valuation of this cultural heritage was often overlooked. There has been a shift in recent decades in cultural policy, which is now prioritized in budget allocations over other social sectors. Culture can and should become a self-sustaining economical asset, as demonstrated by the success of cultural tourism in some nations. Preserving the rich heritage of all ethnic communities in the KiM and the Republic of Serbia necessitates the active implementation and update of cultural assets' valuation to boost tourism. The valorisation of historic heritage to enhance tourism should adhere to global criteria, which direct its protection and conservation, and contribute to economic growth and reconciliation.
