The aim of this research is to gauge the competitiveness of the Serbian economy, assess the effectiveness of its competitiveness policy, and understand the role of clusters in enhancing regional competitiveness within Serbia. The hypotheses were tested using methodologies established by the World Economic Forum, the Center for Strategy and Competitiveness, University of Stockholm, and the European Cluster Observatory. The goal was to identify the link between the strength of clusters in regions, as calculated by the location quotient, and GDP per capita as a productivity indicator, across five countries referred to as G-5: Hungary, Bulgaria, Greece, Romania, and Serbia. The necessary statistics for this study were collected from Serbia's Statistical Office, EUROSTAT, the World Economic Forum, and the European Cluster Observatory. The findings reveal a decline in Serbian competitiveness indicators, particularly when compared with similarly developed nations, and the measures for competitiveness policy appear weak and inadequate. In the G-5 nations, strong positive correlation was observed in 13 out of the 20 cluster categories analysed in relation to the strength of clusters in regions and regional competitiveness.
