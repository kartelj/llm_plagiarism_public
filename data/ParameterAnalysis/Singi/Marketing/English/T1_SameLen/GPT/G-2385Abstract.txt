Day by day, the user-base of mobile phones continues to grow. Looking back at the evolution of mobile devices, we can deduce that device manufacturers have innovated to create highly advanced devices that can aptly be termed as smartphones. These devices, with their augmented capacity and impact on our daily lives, have made us increasingly reliant on them. They are utilized in diverse ways: from making phone calls, internet surfing, to using myriad services such as SMS, MMS, emails, cameras, or even GPS. 

However, as mobile technology grows, the first security challenges begin to crop up, specifically affecting data transfer channels from sender to receiver. The security risks associated with these devices are expanding, largely because sufficient security mechanisms and protective tools are yet to be put in place. The rise of operating systems for mobile phones has complicated this issue further. Each OS comes with its own set of advantages for the user; unfortunately, it also brings many security vulnerabilities. 

Given the increasing popularity of the internet on mobile devices, there exist significant risks tied to safe communication and the establishing of communication channels. With the escalating massive usage of mobile devices, it's vital to think about the security of mobile communication for all involved. 

Open source projects provide developers with a whole platform for building solutions based on their ideas. The ability to access the source code of an OS has led to an OS that has taken over all other systems, becoming a global leader in mobile phones - the Android operating system. It quickly gained popularity among developers and beyond, as it utilizes the Java programming language. Android presents as an open platform for mobile devices, permitting modifications even at the OS level. Consequently, developers have the chance to develop custom security mechanisms that aren't typical for other mobile platforms. 

The Android OS is built on the Linux OS and is part of the Open Source Association. Within seven years since its inception, up till the time of this paper, the Android OS has progressed to version 7.0. An examination of Android's security mechanisms was carried out and exposed certain weaknesses, particularly in the low-level security framework that encases the system. Survey results point to a deficiency in user knowledge about mobile phone safety on the internet. 

Based on an in-depth analysis of the Android OS and its security mechanisms, results indicate that there's a pressing need to enhance the Android security framework. Proposed measures for improvement include the use of SE Linux. A comparison was drawn and the differences between the Android Open Source Project (AOSP) and the submitted Secure Enhanced Android system were highlighted. This paper concludes with potential future work directions.
