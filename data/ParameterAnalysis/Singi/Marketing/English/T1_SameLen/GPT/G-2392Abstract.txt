The Phd thesis topic explores the explanation and understanding of ethics along with merged marketing communications via the utilization of ethics in various marketing areas, beginning with advertising, marketing research, crafting marketing, and promotional mix, and communication with targeted demographics, specifically targeting children and adolescents. The study's findings reveal potential impact of the brand product on purchasing behaviour and media selection and tracking by young people, attitudes towards ads and examination of consumer and materialistic outlooks in children, especially when influenced by ads. The establishment of a distinct communication approach by a business in the children's product and service market contrasts with a business that employs a general communication approach. The use of an integrated marketing communication model for young people requires adherence to ethical norms, guidelines, and codes in executing all marketing efforts aimed at children. The central hypothesis posits that mass communication is disposed of through merged marketing communications, and that the business can effectively reach both existing and potential customers in an ethical manner. Thanks to additional hypotheses, research reveals the effects of ads on young people; measurement of the impact of brand products and services on children's purchasing habits; onset of parent-child conflict resulting from frequent ad exposure; comparison of the world in ads and reality, and potential escalation of material values among children due to ad stimuli. The findings demonstrate that younger students (lower grades of primary school), compared to older students (higher grades of primary school), have a more positive attitude towards advertising and preference for branded products and services. Undoubtedly, frequent ad exposure encourages children to ask for purchases, thereby heightening parent-child conflicts. Children generally do not believe that the world portrayed in ads reflects reality. The presence of increases in material values in children due to ad stimuli has been affirmed.
