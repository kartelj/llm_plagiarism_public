The world crisis profoundly affected all transitioning nations, including ours, resulting in decreased investments, exodus of foreign investors, and escalating debts. The banking sector in Bosnia and Herzegovina managed to weather the severe impacts of the economic downturn, thanks in part to its conservative approach, reducing the need to take unnecessary risks as their business model remained profitable. A review of the stock market operations in Bosnia and Herzegovina during this time shows a trajectory from establishment to growth, and then to a slump in trade, due to not only the economic downturn but also internal aspects. The most vital element of our financial system is the banking sector, heavily privatised and dominated by foreign private capital, with deposits being the primary source of business operations and loans being the core product. Given that loans are the go-to method of fund placement, dominating overall bank operations, credit risk poses a cash flow and bank liquidity issue, the focus of this thesis. To maintain a quality loan portfolio, bank management need a clear loan policy to maximise profitability within a risk level acceptable to the bank. The thesis explores the dynamics of non-performing loans in Republika Srpska, utilising data from the Banking Agency of Republika Srpska’s 2009 – 2016 reports. Goals were to test econometric theory, provide empirical results, and forecast future values. The control of credit risk, liquidity risk, and foreign exchange risk is prioritized given Bosnia and Herzegovina’s economic conditions (undeveloped capital markets, insufficient regulations for realisation/collection of collateral, dominance of credit operations). Sophisticated market valuations are not yet viable due to lack of a market for most asset items. Foreign investor interest in our banking market surfaced in the early 2000s, prompted by our developed finance and credit markets, Gross Domestic Product level, low inflation rate, economic growth, and productivity. Return on investment was a key factor, leading them to dominate these markets and improve competitiveness. German, Austrian, Italian, and French banks showed the most interest. The entrance of these foreign banks brought expected benefits such as the introduction of new technologies, better competitiveness and infrastructure, and more foreign investors. Those with the most foreign capital outperformed local banks due to superior service provision.
