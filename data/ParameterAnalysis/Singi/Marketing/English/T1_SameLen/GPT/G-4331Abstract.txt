Examining the practical and theoretical issues associated with the concept of motivation, an immediate question is whether organizations can enhance performance and job satisfaction solely by emphasizing motivation management through monetary rewards and external influences. This thesis commences with self-determination theory, which points to the existence of diverse motivations varying in their degree of autonomy. True to its doctrines, the different motivations are organized across a motivation spectrum. At one extreme is the most self-governed motivation form- intrinsic motivation. On the opposite end is amotivation, or a complete lack of motivation. Between these two extremes lies a range of extrinsic motivations, varying in their autonomy levels and self-determined nature. The thesis meticulously demonstrates the principal doctrines of self-determination theory's applicability to a group of workers from Serbia's hospitality industry, aiming to showcase motivation techniques and methods. The researcher explores how much factors such as work ambiance and job nature impact motivation structure (autonomous/controlled/amotivation), and by extension, job satisfaction and individual well-being. The study was carried out with employees from 4 and 5-star hotels in Belgrade. The accumulated data was evaluated using SPSS, version 23 statistical software. Descriptive analysis (mean, standard deviation), Cronbach Alpha Coefficient for measuring scales' reliability on the study sample, and statistical inference were employed for data analysis. Correlation coefficient, T-test, and variance analysis were used to examine links and differences based on measured attributes. This study validates the applicability of self-determination theory's teachings in workplace settings.
