Tourism, as a component of the global system, must establish its unique social infrastructure, relationships, and institutions, with a visual (design) presence, considering certain facts: 1) it should adapt and respond to the evolving needs of potential clients resulting from changes in societal growth, standards, market, practices and lifestyles influenced by education and information; 2) it should be economically feasible and environmentally conscious concerning capital owners, nature and environment preservation, and cultura civilization's accomplishments. The basic facet of the tourism sector of hospitality equates to a profitable target in the market economy. Hospitality forms a complex hotel product with dedicated, meticulously engineered, and well-equipped services, designed for masses based on their needs, tastes, capabilities, wishes. It theoretically establishes by location, views, premises, facilities, amenities, price and brand image 6, experience signifies an outcome rather than the hotel product’s structure 7, and these instances denote essentially they are the hotel product location and amenities 8, while the key external factors are the service costs and the hotel's reputation. The growth of global tourism, predicated on the overall progress of the world's economy, standard of living, and emerging consumer needs, cultivates the further enhancement of hotel products in terms of quality, price, specialization, and standardization, as all the additional consumer benefits 9 because they generate new experiences: entertainment, leisure, therapy, learning, shopping urges, personal services etc. 10 The design of hotel products, the subject of this doctoral dissertation, is depicted as the artistic technological challenge and objective for service creators, a marketing strategy for segmentation, positioning, restructuring, i.e. diversifying the hotel product, and a visual device to satisfy tourists' needs in the competitive battle for their market share. The fundamental hypothesis of the dissertation – that the successful design of hotel products significantly differentiates them and leads to market acceptance – is reinforced by the appended scientific research theory and practice in tourism.
