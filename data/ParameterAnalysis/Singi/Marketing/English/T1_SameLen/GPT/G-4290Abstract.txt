In today's economic climate, international funding to meet societal needs is essential for the functioning of modern societies. This dissertation focuses on the importance placed on international finance by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), one of the top European investment institutions. It examines its impact on Serbia's market and economy. The current form of international finance in Central and Eastern Europe began in 1990 with the establishment of the EBRD to support transitioning countries. International investment funding isn't unfamiliar to Serbia, especially post the international sanctions lift in 2001. This financial avenue is crucial for the Serbian economy's recovery after the 1990s GDP drop. Convoluted economic relationships, advancing technology, and production increase financial sourcing needs, the primary subject of this dissertation. The research aims to delve into the relevance and necessity of these foreign investment institutions and promote their growth. The Central and Eastern European countries' successful, multifaceted collaboration with the EBRD involves investment loans, co-funding projects, joint ventures, primarily in energy, infrastructure, transportation, and the financial sector. The aim is to transition these economies to a market-based system and integrate them into the unified European market. The study's primary conclusion is that planned, well-structured internation financial institution lending is necessary for a thriving national economy. Fiscal sustainability and monetary stability are critical to secure this type of financing due to complex commerce relations and trends. Beneficial, trustworthy international investments aid in the growth and development of the economy. The transition process requires additional international funding. All economies with EBRD partnerships experienced excessively high economic growth, with improved business performance compared to recession periods. The significance of the EBRD partnership for Serbia isn't fully recognized, despite its benefits. A rational attitude towards the country's credit indebtedness is also necessary. The EBRD's impact on investments and Serbia's economic revival and transition was analyzed. A positive correlation between these investments and Serbia's GDP growth identified the EBRD's positive contribution to Serbia's GDP growth. The EBRD's significant role in economic recovery and transitional support was confirmed through financial and advisory services. This dissertation pinpoints the advantages of collaboration with the EBRD and the necessity to improve this partnership through specific measures and economic trend analysis and numerous project examples.
