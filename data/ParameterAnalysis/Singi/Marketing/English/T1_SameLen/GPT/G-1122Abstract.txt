The findings from this thesis suggest that guiding tourists plays a crucial and diverse role in modern tourism, especially in terms of showcasing destinations and attractions to visitors. The act of guiding tourists involves conducting a guided tour, chosen by the clientele willingly, and its casual nature aids in the efficient communication of information, data, wisdom, and feelings. An excellent and safe tourism experience, provided by a guided tour, includes the guide, the tourist, and the environment, and is realized when all these elements interact simultaneously. Several relationships then form, among tourists and the environment, tourists and the guide, and among all three entities. The guide's narration and group management capabilities notably influence the participants' tour experience. Therefore, it could be argued that tourist guides impact not just the quality of a destination's total tourism product, but also individual tour operator and travel agency products. Their role in the tourism system is defined by their capability to control and coordinate tourism experiences, promote destinations, and achieve sustainable and responsible tourism objectives. What guides demonstrate and interpret affects how their clients perceive a place or attraction, understand the local culture, participate in tourist activities, and behave during their visit. As a presenter and interpreter, the guide acts as a representative and "ambassador" of a destination in the tourists' eyes. The guide influences whether tourists feel welcomed, decide to stay longer or return. They significantly impact tourists' perception of a destination, and sometimes even become a symbol of the destination. Tour guiding is undoubtedly a strategic factor in successfully showcasing destinations in modern tourism, significantly impacting the tourism experience, duration of stay, and resultant economic and social advantages.
