Between 2000-2014, the technological infrastructure and factor intensity of Serbian merchandise exports improved significantly. Nevertheless, these changes didn't sufficiently enhance the domestic export structure or facilitate sustainable, robust long-term growth. The quality of Serbian merchandise exports, as measured by the higher processing goods' proportion, is noticeably trailing behind EU countries and slightly behind transitioning Central European economies. This paper examines shifts in the technological structure and factor intensity of domestic merchandise exports, focusing on the shares of skill-intensive manufacturing, high, and 'medium-high' technology products within the total exports during 2000-2014. Modern technology's influx and especially FDI in competitive sectors can expand the export portfolio. A refined employment policy approach and extensive science and education system revamp are vital. Proactive industrial policies, alongside sector and firm strategies, can stimulate a transition towards high-tech activities with substantial spill-over effects. Export-driven growth crucial for Serbia relies on foreign trade expansion. The institutional frameworks facilitating this are already in place, like the EU Stabilization and Association Agreement with Serbia and CEFTA. The euro area's projected moderate increase in import demand in 2015 and 2016 is noteworthy for Serbia, despite constraints due to the Eurozone's subdued total demand growth and the Euro's recent depreciation. Caused by this research, it is possible to survey the critical competitiveness indicators of SMEs across transition economies, exploring links with competitiveness strategies and external environmental factors. Shaping the environment by removing significant hindrances and deploying suitable competitiveness strategies sets the foundation for strategic positioning of SMEs in a transitional context, enhancing their competitiveness. Serbia requires a new systemic competitiveness model encompassing the political and economic drivers of successful industrial development, where state and societal actors consciously create favorable conditions. This model differentiates four levels: The microlevel of firms and their networks, the mesolevel of particular policies and institutions, the macrolevel of general economic conditions, and the metalevel of slow variables, socio-cultural structures, the economy's basic order and orientation, and the social actors' strategy-formation capabilities.
