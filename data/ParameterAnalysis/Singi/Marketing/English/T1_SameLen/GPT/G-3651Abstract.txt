Protecting natural ecosystems, which offer diverse services to humanity, is increasingly gaining attention both scientifically and practically. This paper focuses on evaluating the richness, potentiality, significance and state of all components of natural ecosystems in Libya's larger protected areas. It introduces models for conserving and sustainably utilizing these ecosystems, particularly with a focus on long-term preservation and supporting sustainable local community development amidst the challenging economic and political climate in Libya. Libya's protected areas are integral to its natural values and, when responsibly exploited, can provide considerable ecosystem services, thereby benefiting local communities. The article examines the protected areas' innate resources and values: abiotic factors (relief, geological context, soil, water, climate), biotic factors (flora, fauna, vegetation), and human population (composition, socio-economic traits, traditional lifestyle and activities, possible pathways for sustainable local community development aligned with natural values and traditions, as well as the protected areas' role in Libya's strategic development). In order for Libya to align with countries that have adopted national sustainability strategies, it should allow for a competitive market economy and steady economic growth, human development and education, higher employment rates and social inclusion, infrastructure development and balanced regional growth, environment protection and sensible natural resource usage. From a study of two respondent groups in two protected areas in Libya, it was concluded that these areas, rich in natural resources and values, provide ecosystem services to locals. By appropriately valuing and managing these resources, their long-term protection, enhancement, and usage can be ensured. However, the role of balanced local community development within these protected areas in contributing to Libya's strategic development has not been fully confirmed due to the small size of the local communities in these areas. An improvement in this respect is likely to be seen with the advancement of tourism in Libya. However, it's necessary to initially foster a culture of environmental protection in citizens outside these protected areas through education at every level. Implementation of international obligations, adoption of national strategies, and the achievement of a higher level of ecological responsibility in line with legislative, institutional, personnel, technical and other prerequisites as per international and national best practices are also required conditions.
