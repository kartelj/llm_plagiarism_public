Modern nations foster tourism as a key export industry, seeing it as an income source and employment catalyst. Amid global competition, countries must invest significantly to foster development and establish a competitive advantage among numerous global destinations. Given Serbia's challenged competitive position, scarce investment, the global economic crisis's impact on foreign direct investment, and lack of project investment, Serbia's government sees its development chance in embracing specific forms of public-private partnership and fostering an environment conducive to their execution, following successful international examples. Investment forms and methods depend on investors' investment strategies and available options under national regulations. The critical, multifaceted relationship between the private partner and national enterprise is amplified in public-private partnership projects. Alongside its economic and legal aspects, this relationship gains significant social and political dimensions, especially for national infrastructure investment. Given Serbiaâ€™s restricted financial resources, it perceives public-private partnerships as another opportunity to revitalize existing businesses, enhance operations, activate new facilities, and create jobs. The thesis highlights the possibilities public-private partnerships offer through long-term organizational models and processes to enhance Serbian tourism competitiveness and ease public finance burdens.
