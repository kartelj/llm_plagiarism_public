The roles of tourism and hospitality in the economies of many countries are growing, with infrastructure investment significantly adding to overall growth. This infrastructure, along with a wide array of tourist goods and services, help halt the ongoing deterioration in rural communities. Within the changing digital landscape, interactivity and customization are central, as globalization and a highly mobile labor market continue to evolve. In this setting, hospitality and tourism businesses publicize job openings, targeting specific audiences through extensive digital data on prospective candidates. Concurrently, non-linear communication and marketing content sharing enable potential candidates to access numerous advertisements relevant to their interests and qualifications. 
 
Studies conducted for a doctoral thesis confirmed that media isnâ€™t merely a passive, one-way message broadcaster, and that its interactive nature offers feedback from a dynamic job market. Findings on social media usage throughout the hiring process affirmed their role as crucial platforms for communication. 
 
Amid the perpetual clash of two dichotomies - long term development, heavily influenced by convergent media communication, and short-term financial goals - tourism and hospitality firms require a well-thought-out and efficient strategy to attract competent candidates possessing the requisite knowledge, experience, and skills.
