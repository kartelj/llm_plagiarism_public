Wine is a crucial element of Montenegro's agriculture given its low local consumption and essential part in exports. The country's distinct wine features and grape varietals underline its importance in the agricultural outputs and for a significant portion of the population. This study's tasks involve exploring and scientifically validating methods to boost this product's domestic market. To achieve this, investments in quality enhancements, marketing channels, and additional activities are needed. Additionally, taking into account previous wine export performances and regional markets, along with weaknesses in overseas promotions, numerous initiatives are evaluated and proposed to sustain and augment export levels. This would also increase sales of top-tier wines by opening up new markets (USA, Canada, Japan, China). It can be anticipated that wine production, a traditional farming sector, will contribute to a nation's agricultural and economic growth. As a result, it's critical to promote all marketing efforts that have been previously overlooked in wine production and sales.
