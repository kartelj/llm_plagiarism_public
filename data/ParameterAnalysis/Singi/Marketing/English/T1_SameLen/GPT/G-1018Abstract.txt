The thesis titled 'Problems of Assessing Value of Small and Medium Enterprises in Different Life Cycle Stages' made substantial contributions in the methodological sense by linking two under-researched aspects of business economics. The aim and focus of the study, as well as the problems, hypothesis, methodology and anticipated research contributions were highlighted in the Introduction of the work. The first portion of the study, dubbed THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK: OVERVIEW OF CURRENT RESEARCH IN THE FIELD OF INTERACTIONS OF DEVELOPMENT STAGES AND ASSESSING VALUE OF SMALL AND MEDIUM ENTERPRISES, stressed the significance of small and medium enterprises for national economic growth, especially in transitional and post-transitional countries experiencing mergers, reengineering, restructuring, and downsizing. These modern business challenges can be addressed through the right small and medium enterprises' growth policies. Understanding that different developmental stages of enterprises pose varied challenges determines the need to study their impact on the enterprise value. This necessitates combining the study of these two fields in a manner that permits analysis, leading to systematization of methodical concepts and methodologies for assessing the value of small and medium enterprises and diagnosing their developmental stages. The methodological framework for this included methods for assessing book value, return value, and liquidation value, alongside models for identifying changes in metamorphosis, behavior and structure. The second part of the paper, Methodological Framework: Overview of Current Methodology in the Field of Interaction of Development and Value Assessing of Small and Medium Enterprises, lays out how the St.Gallen methodology was used. This methodology provided a step-by-step overview of four standard ideal developmental models with suggested criteria. Of the 55 small and medium enterprises in the sample, 15 were excluded as their phase could not be identified while the remaining 40 were categorized into four ideal developmental phases. The book, yield, and liquidation values of each enterprise were evaluated, their performance analytically and synthetically assessed using Klariceks DF and Belaks BEX models, and their future predicted using Klarickes Quick Test model. The third part of the paper, titled APPLICATIVE FRAMEWORK: OVERVIEW OF CURRENT RESEARCH IN THE FIELD OF INTERACTION OF DEVELOPMENT PHASES AND ASSESSING VALUE OF SMALL AND MEDIUM ENTERPRISES, put hypotheses to the test, with a focus on the central hypothesis and four supplementary hypotheses. The validity of interactions of developmental phases and the choice of the proposed methodology were also examined. The conclusion summarized the research and presented its key findings, offering recommendations for future studies.
