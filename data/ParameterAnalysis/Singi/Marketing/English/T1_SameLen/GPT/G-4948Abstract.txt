The study, "Investment Performance Evaluation of the United States Equity Thematic and Sector Mutual Funds' Portfolios," has dual-defined objectives. Its scientific aim is to break down, scrutinize, and elucidate the investment performance of assumed portfolios formed from mutual funds with specified stocks' universes, guided by officially sanctioned investment strategies. Its social aim is to provide a suitable evaluation technique for investment performance, which could form a basis for regulatory standards and also deliver value for numerous internal and external stakeholders. Two sets of models for attributing investment performance were used in the research methodology: factor and asset-based models. For the former, the utilized ones include: capital asset valuation model, three-factor Fama-French model, Carhart model, and five-factor Fama-French model. For the latter, Brinson-Hood-Beebower and Brinson-Fachler models and geometric ones were used. The study, focusing on thematic mutual funds, accounted for 240 individual funds in the United States. Mutual funds were examined at both the individual and the portfolio level through a 2x2 matrix of market capitalization and investment style. Each scrutinized portfolio comprises 60 investment funds of a particular investment theme. Dominant market factors were recognized using factor-based models. Furthermore, the employment of asset-based models reaffirmed factor model results for the prevailing investment style. The impacts on mutual fund portfolios and individual mutual funds were determinable for all assessed factors. Influences aligning with initial model expectations were market premium, company size, momentum, and company profitability. Influences deviating from initial model expectations were investment style and the company's investment conservatism. The assessment of investment performance also revealed variations in excess returns based on sector. A presence of momentum was seen in realized excess returns per sector. These findings infer that specific facets of the investment philosophy materialize in investment strategies that go beyond mere passive sector tracking based on exposure realization. Significant return boosts were possible through portfolio annual rebalancing when a predominant market investment style was anticipated. This is affirmed by results centered on thematic mutual fund exposure and the yearly sector allocation effects in sector mutual fund-related studies. Possible inconsistencies with the stated investment strategies were detected by evaluating achieved exposure in relation to observed factors and by scrutinizing the portfolio's structure. Based on analysis of the study's findings, a high consistency level at the portfolio and individual level based on the influence of factors from the applied models was concluded. Using asset-based models, which employ information about the portfolio structure and the benchmark, led to potentially more useful results by better synchronizing with the investment decision-making process. The coupling of factor and asset-based models confirmed some contemporary market tendencies and provided insights not possible with just factor models. The deficiencies of arithmetic models for attributing investment performance over multiple periods were rectified by implementing geometric models. This enabled the successful combination of multi-period returns using geometric attribution models without residuals. This, therefore, guaranteed the consistency of attribution effects across varying showcased periods.
