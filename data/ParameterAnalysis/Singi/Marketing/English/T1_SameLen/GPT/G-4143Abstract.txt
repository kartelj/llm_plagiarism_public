This dissertation studies profitability analysis, basic profitability determinants identification, and their effects on the agricultural enterprises' profitability within the Republic of Serbia. From a theoretical standpoint, it expounds on agriculture's peculiarities, agricultural production, its significance for economic growth and the role of agricultural enterprises for agricultural advancement. It elaborates on the variations between traditional and modern techniques in assessing corporate performance, listing and theoretically interpreting fundamental standards of both approaches. Theoretical and empirical investigations are conducted in this dissertation. Domestic and international authors' research results back the theoretical examination of the research subject, while the empirical analysis was performed based on regular financial summaries of agricultural enterprises' operations and various reports on individual macroeconomic variables' movement. The sample comprises 151 agricultural enterprises specialising in primary agricultural production from 2014 to 2018. A statistical profitability review has shown the enterprises to have generally succeeded, making profits throughout the observed duration. Profitability analysis by different indicators showed differences between enterprises in their success levels and over time. Apart from determining profitability levels and discrepancies among individual agricultural enterprises, this dissertation aimed to identify factors making some enterprises profitable and others not. In pinpointing statistically significant profitability determinants, commonly used determinants for measuring their impact on enterprises' profitability were applied. Internal profitability determinants manipulated by companies aforenamed are: company size, liquidity, indebtedness, sales growth and asset materiality. The influence of the following uncontrollable external determinants by companies on profitability is also assessed: gross domestic product and inflation. An econometric panel model technique was adopted due to its ability to provide substantial information and objective conclusions by observing data temporally and spatially. Prior to deducing conclusions about each determinant's effect on profitability, it was confirmed that the variables used in this research are stationary, do not have high correlations or multicollinearity problems, and do not exhibit heteroskedasticity or autocorrelation issues in the regression model. Besides, statistical test results suggested that the fixed-effect regression model was most suitable. Lastly, it was determined that companies' size, indicating profitability, had a positive and statistically significant impact on asset returns rate, while liquidity, indebtedness, gross domestic product, and inflation negatively and significantly influenced profitability. The remaining two factors, sales growth and asset materiality, didn't significantly affect asset returns rate (profitability). This empirical study's findings will aid the analysed enterprises' management and other stakeholders in easier future decision-making.
