The financial system's structure has been undergoing substantial transformations for several decades. These transformations are evident in the altered importance of various types of financial institutions, the incorporation of various financial activity groups into complex financial institutions, and an increase in the scale and scope of their operations. Bank and other financial institution mergers and acquisitions are extensively used in the context of restructuring the financial sector. A surge in bank mergers and acquisitions in developed EU nations is seen as part of international trends like bank re-organisation and bank growth, and also a result of establishing a single financial market initiated by the introduction of the euro. Increasing competitiveness in the real and financial sector is vital for bolstering bank mergers and acquisitions aimed at enhancing business efficiency and profitability in a global context. While bank mergers and acquisitions in developed EU nations involve transferring proprietary rights among private owner shareholder groups, in transition countries they generally involve acquisitions of previously state-owned banks, primarily by foreign banks from developed EU nations. The banking sector's economic aspect in transition comprises increased bank efficiency and profitability, the application of contemporary financial technology, and the adoption of modern risk management methods. To ensure the successful conclusion of mergers and acquisitions, proper planning and evaluation of these processes, along with the implementation of a suitable post-acquisition integration strategy, are necessary.
