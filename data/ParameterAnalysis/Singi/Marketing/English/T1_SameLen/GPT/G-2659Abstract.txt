The importance of tourism competitiveness, and in turn the competitiveness of tourist destinations, is growing in both scientific circles and among tourism locales themselves, as current market tendencies play a significant part in the progress of tourism sites. Sites must provide exceptional experiences that set them apart from their competition. By doing so, they enhance their appeal, securing a stronger competitive standing. The task of destination management is to judiciously employ available resources in line with sustainability principles, while implementing clear, effective strategies for destination product advancement, which generates added value to the visitorâ€™s experience. Achieving superior competitiveness for tourism destinations necessitates regular measurement of the tourist destination competitiveness, employing various assessment techniques that consider past, present and future competitiveness. In this context, competitiveness measurement becomes the foundation for product development in the sector. The measurement results determine the destination's standing against established competition and serve as guidance for future development and overcoming current competitive weaknesses. Initial steps toward establishing destination competitiveness involve ranking competitiveness markers to form a framework and set guidelines for future growth and destination competitiveness positioning. This investigation proposes continual competitiveness measurement as an integral element of tourism destination management. The study focuses on the competitiveness of tourist destinations and measurement indicators, with special emphasis on Serbia as a tourist destination. The research lays the groundwork for creating a model for future continual Serbian tourism competitiveness measurement. Therefore, the modified integrated destination competitiveness model proposed here is employed to assess Serbia's competitiveness as a tourist destination. Findings highlight competitiveness aspects where Serbia should concentrate future development efforts. The analysis illuminates strengths and weaknesses in Serbia's competitive positioning as a tourist site.
