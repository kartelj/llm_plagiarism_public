The study into the impact of solar attacks, undertaken for this thesis, has revealed that current state-of-the-art electric power system (EPS) defenses may be inadequate against severe solar storms. Contributing factors such as Earth's magnetosphere weakening, the 2003 South African solar storm (with a similar latitude to Serbia), the destabilization attempt on Venezuelan EPS by the USA in 2019, and Serbia's complex security situation, have all inspired the need to quickly draft a strategic restructure of the Serbian Electric Power Company to improve resilience. The 2014 floods, which put Thermal Power Plant (TPP) "Kolubara" and TPP "Nikola Tesla A" out of operation for a significant time, reaffirmed the risk natural disasters pose to Serbia's EPS operations. A thorough investigation into EPS failure highlights the vulnerability of relying on a handful of major electrical energy (EE) suppliers, especially the risk of high voltage transformer saturation incapacitating the entire EPS for 12 to 16 months (Lloyd's report states). In South Africa, certain EPS areas took four years to be functional again. Threats to normal economic functionality, leading to widespread societal unrest and chaos, all meticulously calculated to dismantle national security, are frequent components of modern hybrid warfare. Examination of Serbian published papers reveals that Serbia's EPS is modern and transitioning from few TPP to many renewable energy sources (RES) by 2030. Given Serbia's volatile security situation in the Balkans, it is crucial not to expose any blatant vulnerabilities. This thesis presents a new paradigm of creating self-sufficient communes (within an existing EPS) focusing on the development of neglected industrial energy. Only big industrial firms can swiftly bolster their secondary EE power systems, converting their thermal units into miniature power stations, and remodelling a local distribution grid into a self-contained virtual network with its own EE providers who will be the energy-independent local administration unit leaders. Surveys gauging changes in Serbian corporate managersâ€™ awareness level related to the 2017 and 2018 solar storms (before and after media coverage) underscore the need to adopt a new Model for creating self-reliant corporations for the swift establishment of energy-independent communes. The model's operational mechanism is underpinned by the leadership of key companies' senior executives, their prowess and status, augmented by memetics and crony capitalism. The model's effectiveness has been validated by the hypothesis and the fourth survey administered among top Serbian executives. Furthermore, the thesis provides practical solutions for shielding against solar proton events and highlights a lack in research regarding health issues linked to solar storms in Serbia.
