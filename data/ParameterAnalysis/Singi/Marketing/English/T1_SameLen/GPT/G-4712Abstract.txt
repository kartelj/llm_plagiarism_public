The thesis explores a largely unstudied aspect of the impact of printing and packaging processes on the traits of printed flexible packaging materials, as well as determining their values using suitable multicriteria evaluation techniques. Experimental analysis of flexible packaging materials has been used to assess and compare their degrees of change. The study and assessment have imposed limitations which mainly pertain to the chosen packaging materials and the nature of the packaged contents. The outcome of this assessment is a clear accumulation of the values for various versions of printed flexible packaging materials, where each material's compliance with the criteria for different food products can be computed.
