Modification of the primary education system in Serbia and Yugoslavia from 1944 to 1959, i.e., from the conclusion of World War II to the implementation of the General Law on Education in 1958, which introduced a universal eight-year primary school system, is a manifestation of the "fight for schooling" started by Serbian society in the late 19th century. This fight is intertwined with attempts to modernize and democratize Serbian and Yugoslav societies in the 20th century. The primary education system's reforms, culminating in the 1958 implantation of a universal eight-year primary school system, are part of the "new school" initiative. After World War II, there was a rapid increase in efforts to define new educational policies and initiate alterations to existing education systems, mainly due to UNESCO's initiatives under the auspices of the United Nations. The "new school" movement, disrupted by the world wars, found new impetus in the resurgence of childhood, severely affected by World War II. The primary education system reforms from 1944 to 1959 were part of the drive for societal cultural transformation initiated by Yugoslavia's revolutionary communist government upon establishing the first government bodies. The path to a more equitable socialist society involved not just political stabilization but also economic recovery, often described as the "overall advancement of society," encompassing "cultural life," which included education. From the outset, "cultural life," including "educational life," was seen as an integral component of the socialist transformation. Decisions made at the CPY's Fifth Congress (1948) had significant impacts on the country's cultural and educational policies, as guided by the CPY's Third Plenary Session resolution (December 1949). All state institutions, especially schools, were expected to adopt new educational policies and contribute to the development of a socialist individual. Schools had to depend on a robust network of mass organizations, with the Pioneer Organization at the forefront, as well as "trusted" party members and a large pool of professionals in various fields concentrated around the Council of Societies for Child and Youth Care. Millions of previously "overlooked" parents also needed to contribute to socialism, like other socialist community members. Through this, the "new" educational policy empowered the concept of school as the spearhead of societal modernization, cultural revolution, and the construction of socialism.
