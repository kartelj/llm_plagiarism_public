Over the past six decades, tourism exhibited a positive growth trajectory, influenced by a variety of beneficial factors. Although it endured negative impacts during certain periods due to economic and non-economic crises, the tourism industry showed an impressive capacity to recover, achieving higher growth rates than the overall global economy. Since the onset of this century, tourism has been affected by various crises and this trend is likely to persist into the foreseeable future. The thesis examines the influence of these crises on tourism, detailing their effects and root causes. It gives special focus to the repercussions of the 2008 global financial and economic crisis on the tourism industry. A distinct survey was conducted to ascertain its impact on tourism in Serbia, with the findings recorded in the thesis. Furthermore, the thesis proposes specific strategies aimed at lessening the adverse impacts of potential future crises.
