The motivation for this PhD thesis lies in the noticed inadequate or subpar use of psychology and the understanding of the consumer in marketing management habits. Focusing on the complexities and financial hazards involved in new product development, it calls for deep analysis and full comprehension of the marketing management process. It further examines the use of psychology in creating new products, exemplified by the case study of Serbian instant coffee products Grand Instant and Doncafe Instant from 2007-2015. 

Empirical sources include both primary and secondary data. Primary data was gathered quantitatively, involving a representative sample of 800 participants aged between 18 and 30 to analyze customer attitudes and satisfaction. A qualitative methodology was also used, by incorporating managers from the companies in question, to delve into corporate thinking. Descriptive statistical methods were used in the analysis. Secondary data related to brand performance came from longitudinal studies conducted by three reputable regional market research agencies.

The thesis scrutinizes whether psychology was incorporated with the required knowledge, understanding and esteem in new product developments. The primary hypothesis confirmed the notion that the underemphasis on consumers and psychological procedures in new product development affect product success and consumer gratification. Consumers were perceived as a group likely to react to a product based on regional trends. Albeit new product development necessitating the grasp and application of marketing management principles, it's often oversimplified. The initial supposition that marketing managers depend on psychology in the new product development, acknowledging its importance but lightly applying it was also affirmed. 

However, this isn't merely due to time-constrained competitiveness but other factors too. The secondary supposition that consumers demonstrate their dissatisfaction and non-use of the product, feeling they aren't sufficiently involved in the process is also affirmed. Consumers were unhappy with how Grand Kafa and Doncafe engaged them when creating new products.

Kickstarting new product development according to consumer needs and meeting their expectations in line with marketing concepts accentuates the undeniable relevance and contribution of psychology in marketing. The thesis concludes that Serbian businesses, other than insufficient application of psychology in new product development, are plagued with deficits relating to the process such as lukewarm acceptance of marketing concepts, the generation of certain formal documents, strategic planning and consumer research. A revised model for new product development is suggested to address these four shortcomings by mandating the formulation of formal documents at distinct stages of product development, which necessitates consumer research and strategic planning whilst adhering to contemporary marketing strategies.
