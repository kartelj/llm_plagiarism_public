Urban tourism development has been a significant field of research over the past few decades. Researchers are keen on emphasizing the significance of cities as multi-functional tourist destinations. Urban tourism, one innovative mode of leveraging existing resources to create new tourist experiences, can enhance a city's competitiveness in the tourism market. Its comparative merits lie in cities' capacity to offer diverse experiences to tourists with varying demographic profiles and travel motivations. Additionally, cities exhibit less season-dependent tourism patterns, suggesting a consistent influx of tourists throughout the year. Current patterns show tourists opting for shorter, more frequent holidays, often experienced as city break trips. This trend improves cities' appeal as tourist destinations, thereby benefitting many tourism providers. This doctoral thesis focuses on urban tourism development in Serbia. To provide a balanced, analytical approach, comprehensive analyses of Serbia's key urban tourism promoters have been carried out. The paper discusses the findings from surveys of both tourism providers and consumers to understand stakeholders' perspectives, assess the current state of urban tourism, and suggest improvements. Tourist surveys have been conducted to gauge the quality of cities' tourist offerings. Interviews with key tourism promoters and relevant government body representatives have been conducted to understand their views on resource importance for urban tourism development, key challenges and potential improvement pathways. This doctoral thesis aims to respond to the question of how to enhance urban tourism development in Serbian cities, given an objective assessment of the current state of urban tourism.
