The study is about how water use affects agriculture in Libya, and the ecological outcomes resulting from this usage. Libya, a predominantly dry and arid country, has approximately 95% of its land covered by the Sahara desert, while arable and pasture lands are concentrated in the northern coastal strip adjacent to the Mediterranean. Water scarcity is prevalent due to limited surface water resources and alternative sources like desalinated water and treated wastewater. Hence, Libya relies heavily on groundwater, constituting around 95% of its total water resource. This makes the country afloat on huge reserves of non-renewable groundwater with the biggest system of the Nubian Sandstone aquifer situated under the southern Libyan desert.

The agricultural sector, contributing about 9% to the GDP and consuming 85% of water supply and 12% of electricity, indicates mismanagement and unsustainability. The environmental impacts of water usage in agriculture were assessed using three ecological indicators: water consumption (drain) indicator, land use (drain) indicator, and water pollution indicator. Results revealed a poor environmental sustainability index, with water consumption in agriculture being especially harmful to the environment in the northern, populous region. Issues like seawater intrusion into groundwater, water pollution, and soil salinization have emerged, and excessive groundwater usage in the southern region has resulted in groundwater depletion and desert lake drying.

A sustainable method to reduce the fallout from water usage in agriculture is proposed, utilizing seawater as a sustainable water source and employing salt-tolerant plants (halophytes) in coastal desert farming. This study explores how seawater can be utilized sustainably to achieve developmental goals in this vast country. Factors facilitating seawater exploitation include lack of coastal underground water inventory overlapping with seawater, irregular rainfall affecting the natural grassland, excessive coastal population leading to groundwater depletion, and the need to conserve non-renewable water sources.

Another sustainability initiative offered is the use of the Great Man-Made River (GMR) for energy generation through hydropower turbines and agricultural production. A shift from freshwater delivery to coastal cities to large, desert-based agriculture projects irrigated by GMR is proposed by building solar-powered seawater desalination plants, ultimately saving underground water and surface water. 

Transitioning from fossil fuels to renewable energy is vital for environmental protection, as agricultural expansion necessitates increased underground water and fuel usage, consequently escalating pollution. While solar energy holds potential, other renewable, clean energy sources are explored in this study for diversification, including power generation through water movement in the GMR pipe and vehicle movement on roads (smart roads). This direction could potentially take advantage of new technologies for clean, renewable, and sustainable energy.
