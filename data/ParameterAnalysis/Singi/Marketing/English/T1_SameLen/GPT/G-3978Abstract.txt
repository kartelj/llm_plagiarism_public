Insolvency and financial strain adversely affect a company's management, owners, workforce, suppliers, consumers, and other integral parties. Bankruptcy reorganisation, facilitated by efficient insolvency law, guarantees the continuance of insolvent yet economically functioning firms. Pertinent inquiries include the impact of financial turmoil and bankruptcy reorganisation on major corporate governance systems, and how these alterations, alongside enforced bankruptcy regulations and the duration of bankruptcy, affect the effectiveness of approved reorganisation schemes. This thesis aims to scrutinise the impact of insolvency and bankruptcy restructure on principal corporate governance systems in considerable and moderately-sized organisations that adopted a restructuring scheme or a pre-packaged reorganisation scheme in Serbia between January 2009 and June 2015. It also examines the adequacy of the approved reorganisation and pre-packaged reorganisation schemes with the aim of identifying elements that can boost the recovery of the Serbian corporate sector. Out of 83 sampled corporations, the ownership structure altered in 18, whilst management structure changed in 32. In the scrutinised firms, the pre-bankruptcy ownership structure transformed post-adoption of the reorganisation plan while the management structure remained relatively unchanged during bankruptcy and a year post-adoption of the reorganisation plan. Logistic and OLS regression analysis demonstrate that company liquidity and owner's pre-bankruptcy involvement in company management impacted changes in pre-bankruptcy ownership structure. The analysis also reveals that company size and bankruptcy procedures applied influenced management turnover in sizable and medium distressed Serbian companies. Other observed variables' impacts on pre-bankruptcy ownership and management structures were statistically insignificant. Regarding the success of bankruptcy reorganisation in Serbia, the thesis indicates that 75% of companies are still undergoing reorganisation while 25% have filed for bankruptcy post-adoption of a reorganisation or pre-packaged reorganisation scheme. The establishment of a creditorâ€™s board or a comparable entity with fewer members post-adoption of the reorganisation scheme may enhance the success of bankruptcy reorganisation in Serbia. Overall, the thesis's findings indicate that bankruptcy reorganisation could be a productive tool for corporate sector rehabilitation in transitioning economies, provided it is accompanied by modifications in corporate governance practices and legal and institutional reforms.
