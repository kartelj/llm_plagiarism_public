The effects of foreign direct investment on the current account are complicated, varying between positive and negative based on the total investment amount and sector-specific allocation. The thesis presented a theoretical and tangible analysis of foreign direct investmentâ€™s effect on Serbia's trade balance and income account, particularly regarding its influence on the Serbian manufacturing sector. Furthermore, an evaluation of foreign direct investment's role in technology transfer in Serbia was conducted, along with an investigation of the capacity to gain access to global markets, the effect on the structure and specialization of exports and imports, and variances in the exchange rate. The dissertation discussed the reasons for the current account deficit in Central and Eastern European countries, and also the impact of foreign direct investment on the sustainability of the current account deficit, considering foreign direct investment as a significant source of financing for the current account deficit, which may cause a financial contagion through various channels.
