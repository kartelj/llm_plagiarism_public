Serbia's spas are a key attraction for both local and international tourists. This tourist domain continues to evolve in response to changing touristsâ€™ needs and expectations. Responding to this sophistication in tourists' demands and their desire for recreation and relaxation at Serbia's spas necessitates readjustments in tourism offerings to outperform rivals. One way to achieve a competitive edge is by utilizing a mix of communication tools to engage prospective tourists. Despite the growing interest, tourists are often physically distant from the spa services they require, necessitating the provision of detailed information about Serbia's spas. Integrating modern information technology into the promotion of spa tourism has yielded considerable advantages for both tourists and the holders of the tourism offers. Marketers of Serbian spa activities benefit from more effective, economical, and comprehensive contact with potential tourists. From the tourists' perspective, benefits include easier access to spa offers, sharing of pictures, and other content about their spa experiences. This study focuses on both traditional and digital communication methods and their effectiveness in promoting Serbian spas. An examination of the websites of selected spa destinations revealed that, while all spas have websites, they are not maximizing the full promotional potential of this platform. Similar irregularities were found in the use of social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest, and Google+. Marketers engaging potential tourists via social media don't appreciate the importance of regular updates of information and content. The study explored the impact of traditional and digital communication methods on spa destination choices, to hypothesize the optimal mix of communication methods to attract potential visitors to Serbian spas. Results revealed that tourists often opt for Serbian spas based on television promotions or recommendations from friends. In terms of digital media, Facebook and website presentations were key information sources. For the effective development of Serbian spa tourism, it is crucial for marketers to employ an appropriate mix of traditional and digital communication tools.
