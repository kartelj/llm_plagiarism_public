Industrial Progress and Power Efficiency: Examining the Interdependence and Meta-Analysis Energy efficiency, energy use and industrial advancement are interconnected across the globe and particularly in Serbia. This proposition has been verified by inspecting the connection between power efficiency and economic expansion in Serbia. It has been proven that the link between power consumption and economic progress is causal, measurable, and applicable to Serbia. Evidence of power efficiency and their fluctuations in Serbia indicates that the rebound effect is relevant and that it is feasible to utilize energy use as a surrogate for energy efficiency in identifying the cause-and-effect relationship with economic expansion. An all-encompassing, systematic literature review using meta-analysis detected aspects causing varied findings in energy-growth nexus research, including variances in study designs, stability of political entities, financial systems, economic development levels, and climate. The link between power use and financial expansion in Serbia is causal, complex, and reliant on the form of energy deployed. Findings are in line with Serbia being a transitioning economy heavily influenced by its primary services industry. The study revealed significant energy conservation elements when determining the causal relationship between total final power usage and gross domestic product. The need for integration of fresh tools and policies to boost power efficiency enhancement is evident. The consideration of power consumption should be included in every growth and development. Comprehending the influence of power consumption and efficiency on economic expansion and development is crucial for establishing suitable economic, energy, and environmental policies.
