Wine-related travel, a unique subset of tourism with significant worldwide growth, should have a central position in Serbia's tourism offerings. This is especially relevant considering Serbia's lack of mass tourism-friendly attractions, which includes wine regions. This study examines the global significance of wine tourism and its role in Serbia's tourism offerings, specifically in the Vrsac region. The objective of the thesis is to ascertain the potential and the future of wine tourism in Serbia by conducting research, comparative analyses, and evaluation. As part of the study of wine tourism, a comparative analysis was done on the importance of various elements of wine tourism offerings and marketing efforts from the perspective of visitors and wine enthusiasts as one unique group and vineyard administrators as another group. The methodology comprises the identification of wine tourism traits, understanding its unique characteristics, defining its core features, and evaluating Serbia's wine tourism offerings. Additionally, the analysis includes assessing the marketing role in wine tourism development, thoroughly comparing tourists and vineyard owners/managersâ€™ attitudes towards specific aspects of the offerings and marketing activities, and eventually discerning the strengths and weaknesses of Serbian wine tourism. After reviewing the research findings, the aims of the study have been achieved. It has been established what wine tourism is, its significance in niche tourism and in the growth of particular tourist destinations, the role of strategic marketing and specific supply segments for the improvement and qualitative positioning of Serbia and Vrsac's wine tourism offerings in target markets, the efficacies of various marketing tools for growth, and Serbia and Vrsac's wine tourism promotion and positioning. It also identifies the most effective marketing channels for transmitting messages from Serbian and Vrsac wine tourism providers to target markets and the most crucial stakeholders involved in Serbia and Vrsac's wine tourism development process. A key finding of the research is that, despite being in its initial stages, wine tourism has considerable potential to enhance Serbia's overall tourism offerings. This could be a threat to survival and the growth of this tourism type due to vineyard owners and managers' underutilization of marketing opportunities, but provides the opportunity to reach a desired market position through education and proper knowledge application.
