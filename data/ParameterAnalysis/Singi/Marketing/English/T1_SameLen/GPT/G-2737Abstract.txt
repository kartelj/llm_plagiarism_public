Serbia boasts a diverse range of tourist attractions and a rich history, with numerous preserved resources. Yet, Serbia's tourism offerings haven't been suitably developed and marketed globally. Enhancing their position entails boosting competitiveness, necessitating significant financial input. Like many developing nations, Serbia sees foreign investment as a prospect for sector growth, tourism modernization, export rise, job creation, income increase, and preventing migration from less developed regions where tourism might be the sole development opportunity due to the plentiful preserved resources. This thesis undertakes a thorough examination of elements crucial for attracting foreign investment in Serbian tourism, complemented by a benchmarking scrutiny of chosen competitive countries to understand how they've increased foreign investment in their tourism sector and the outcomes they've experienced. The competitive standing of Serbia compared to these countries is also explored. The research, based on survey findings, uncovers the extent of satisfaction of the attraction elements for foreign investment into Serbian tourism and identifies prime areas for improvement. The survey also gauges the allure of Serbian tourism for foreign investors and prioritizes other critical areas needing work. The concluding research will focus on the competitive environment of the local tourist destination using the adapted Porter's Five Forces model to discover opportunities for bolstering the destination's standing against the five forces, to assess its strengths, weaknesses, chances, and threats, and to outline the strategy for attracting foreign investment and improving its competitiveness. This thesis is aimed to help answer the question of how to attract foreign investment in Serbian tourism, specifically, what strategies should be implemented to better the existing framework which would increase this sector's competitiveness.
