A trend has emerged in cruise tourism where companies are placing increased emphasis on enhancing the quality of the cruise experience as it greatly affects overall customer satisfaction and dictates their future behavior. Therefore, the focus of this dissertation is to study the characteristics and outcomes of this quality cruise experience. The issue being researched is a better comprehension of this experience, and the development of a tool to measure its causes and effects. The writer has opted for a comprehensive approach in testing the model of service theater (cruise ship performance) and service quality (quality dimensions), both of which can be used to successfully design quality cruise experiences. The philosophical foundations of this study are postmodernism, postpositivism, and interpretivism and it makes use of both qualitative and quantitative data collection methods. The research plan in this paper, in alignment with these philosophies, utilizes a mixture of inductive and deductive methods. A structural equation model was employed to test the conceptual model. Findings showed that employees, guests, service setting, and service quality are precursors to the cruise experience. However, only feelings experienced during the trip positively affected overall satisfaction and dictated future actions. Despite its importance, the topic of cruise experience quality is not well-researched in academia. As such, this study adds to the understanding and burgeoning theory of cruise experience quality. The research was conducted on a cruise ship in collaboration with guests ensuring all influences were considered. Hence, the practical implications of the study are significant with the findings, insights, and recommendations providing opportunities for managerial action.
